"5.30pm Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat Agar to Mohammad Naim, 1 wide another one turns far down leg side from a good length on middle, and it is a wide Turner to Mahedi Hasan, 1 wide turns down leg, and a wide. Full length on middle and leg, and he is beaten on his sweep as the ball turns down Turner to Mahedi Hasan, 1 wide and another wide, this time outside off Turner to Mahedi Hasan, 3 wide Wade misses this ball, as it turns down leg after pitching full on middle and leg. The batter misses is sweep too, and that is wide again Turner to Mahedi Hasan, OUT top edge gobbled at midwicket! Shorter in length on middle, and the ball seemed like stopping on to the pitch as he went for the pull off his back foot. The bat entirely came out of his hands as he played that. Anyway, that is a wicket Turner will gladly accept after a couple of wides in the over Christian to Shakib, 1 leg bye goes for the lap, but is beaten. Full ball on off from wide of the crease again. The ball trickles off his arm toward point, and they sneak in a leg bye Christian to Mohammad Naim, OUT taken at point! Goes for the reverse-sweep to this good length ball on off, but gets it off the higher part of the bat with his bottom hand coming off as well. Short third man thought for a moment that the ball was coming on to him and even took a few steps forward, but left it for the man at point in the end. Easy catch as well Zampa to Shakib, OUT appeal for leg before, and the finger goes up! Shakib is dismisses leg before for the first time in T20Is. Full length on middle, and he closes his bat face pretty early to try and clip that to the leg side. But the ball zips through to strike his front pad, and the umpire calls him out after a brief thought Agar to Mahmudullah, OUT that's a dolly! It was short of a length, held in the surface then straight, he was through the shot and got a leading edge that looked straight up Christian to Soumya, OUT straight to long-off! That looked quite good off the bat, a lofted off drive, but he couldn't get the distance Ellis to Nurul, OUT dragged on! Back of a length outside off, Nurul swinging across the line and gets a bottom edge into middle stump Christian to Mosaddek, 1 bye full outside off, attempts a reverse sweep, it's through to Wade and they steal a bye Ellis to Afif, OUT picks out short fine leg trying to scoop, was full outside off, he shuffled across but couldn't only get height on the ball and no distance Ellis to Mosaddek, OUT direct hit from Wade...bottom edge as he swings across the line, just misses off stump. Neat gather and throw Wade and McDermott Christian take their time to come out of their hut though. A change in the opening combination for Australia too after the latter's assault of five sixes in an over last game. Mahedi, who opened the batting too, will start with the ball to Christian. Over the wicket Nasum to Marsh, OUT struck on the front pad, and given leg before! But Marsh reviews. Good length ball on middle, and he is across the stumps while trying to slog that to the on side with his back leg way outside off. He his down on his back knee, as it hits him close to his knee. Replays show that would have hit middle and leg, and Marsh has to walk back. The stumps were clearly visible when Meanwhile, Gnasher and our stats whiz Sampath have alerted me to the fact that this is the quickest Australia have been bowled out in all international cricket. Whew! Took just 13.4 overs today, and their previous low was 14.3 overs. Player of the match is Shakib Al Hasan, BDESH","Bangladesh 122 for 8 (Naim 23, Ellis 2-16, Christian 2-17) beat Australia 62 (Wade 22, Shakib 4-9, Saifuddin 3-12) by 60 runs It was a nightmarish end to a tough tour for Australia. As if losing the series wasn't enough, in the final T20I, they lost 8 for 24 to collapse to 62 all out in a chase of 123. This was their lowest total across limited-overs cricket. It meant Bangladesh took the series 4-1 in Dhaka. Shakib Al Hasan, who nabbed his 100th T20I wicket on the way, led with a haul of 4 for 9, with Mohammad Saifuddin grabbing 3 for 12 as Bangladesh choked Australia, not for the first time, with spin."
"7.00pm Australia have won the toss and will bat - consistency from Aaron Finch in this area. Four wins from four. Cottrell to Finch, 1 wide bouncer over the stumps, wide signaled from square leg. Fair call. Finch isn't the tallest guy in the Australia squad by any stretch. Thomas to Marsh, SIX runs Marsh is unfazed being bounced at 137 kph and hammers this pull shot from fourth stump high over square leg and it sails out of the ground. First replacement ball of the night is making its way out to the middle. Thomas to Marsh, (no ball) length ball on fourth stump at 136 kph, Marsh got carried away trying to heave this out of the ground over midwicket and his head bobs all over the place out of control. Thomas gets away with it... not quite. He's overstepped again, this time over by 3 inches and the free hit stays in play. Russell to Marsh, 1 wide starts with a wide speared full but way outside the off side guidelines. Simmons to Finch, SIX runs all the way! Short of a length, bit of a long hop really, Finch heaves it over deep midwicket Walsh to Finch, OUT he strikes again! Full at off stump, Finch aiming a slightly ungainly heave across the line and misses. Might have been held back a touch Walsh to Carey, OUT gone first ball! What a series he's having. Full at middle and leg, Carey aiming to work it off his pads and gets a looping leading edge at head height Russell to Henriques, 1 wide pushed across very wide outside off from round the wicket Russell to Henriques, OUT taken at long-on! Closer to off stump, full length, Henriques tries to fetch it and swings down the ground from a crouched position. Can't clear Allen Walsh to Turner, OUT beautiful delivery! He could be stumped here. Delightful bowling. Full at off stump, grips and spins away to beat the edge as Turner lunges forward. He over balances and Pooran whips off the bails. Third umpire checking first if he edge it. Well, Turner appears to have already walked off the field Allen to Marsh, OUT huge appeal for caught behind and it's another review...round the wicket, Marsh went for the pull and didn't connect. Pooran was up instantly. Marsh is walking off so he thinks he's hit it. And, yes, a big spike. Spin strikes again. Was a good catch. Allen to Christian, SIX runs big full toss is put away...poor delivery from Allen and Christian hoists it over deep midwicket Christian to Lewis, 1 wide slower ball at 118 kph lands full and very wide outside the guidelines, will need to be rebowled. Zampa to Lewis, OUT Zampa finally has his first wicket of the series! Lewis got a bit carried away here and really gifted his wicket by backing away well outside leg stump trying to carve over cover. It wasn't full enough for such a drive but because it was premeditated Lewis went for the shot anyway to a good length b Marsh to Gayle, OUT full on sixth stump, Gayle tries to heave this back through the leg side over wide long-on, plenty of power behind this but not nearly enough elevation as it screams flat to Behrendorff on the rope. Gayle's bad luck to pick out the tallest man on the field who bunny hops to take this reaching above Meredith to Simmons, 1 wide gets this a touch too wide outside off and even though Simmons was moving outside leg that's a fair call Meredith to Allen, SIX runs three in row! Onto the grass banks. What an innings from Allen. Who needs Andre Russell? This was wider outside off, another slower ball, Allen opened the face a touch and carved it over deep point Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 189 for 6 (Marsh 75, Finch 53, Walsh Jr 3-27) beat West Indies 185 for 6 (Simmons 72, Marsh 3-24) by four runs A career-best night with both bat and ball from Mitchell Marsh ensured Australia got off the mark in the series as Mitchell Starc stymied Andre Russell at the death to clinch a four-run victory over West Indies. After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Marsh propelled Australia to 189 for 6 with 75 off 44 balls, his third half-century in four innings this series. Defending the total, Marsh followed it up with 3 for 24 including a prized trio of scalps - Chris Gayle, Lendl Simmons and stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran - to stunt momentum in the West Indies chase. Needing 11 off the final over and with Russell on strike, after Riley Meredith had been taken for four sixes by Fabian Allen in the 19th, Starc came around the stumps and bowled four leg stump yorkers that Russell could not get under to elevate and - with only the tail left in at the non-striker's end - resulted in turned down singles on each occasion. On the fifth ball, Russell flubbed a knee-high full toss well short of the rope at deep midwicket before a boundary on the final ball made a cosmetic adjustment to the final margin."
"Rashid to Finch, 2 wide angled down the leg side, he goes for a dab-sweep, doesn't make contact, rebounds off Buttler's gloves Rashid to Smith, OUT he's got Smith! What a strike for Rashid. Gets it outside off, just a hint of turn, and a thin nick to Buttler. He actually played outside this, away from his body, and got an inside edge. Not sure Buttler took it entirely cleanly, Plunkett to Head, 1 wide down the leg side Plunkett to Head, OUT dragged on! We saw a few of those in the Test match here. Good length, outside off, aiming to play square through the off side and gets a bottom edge into the timber. The seventh ball of the over proves a bonus for England! Plunkett to Finch, 1 leg bye angled into the pads, doesn't get any bat on it as he looks to flick and it bobbles behind square Rashid to Finch, SIX runs smashed up and over long-on! Not really timed, nor to the pitch of the ball. But all levers and power! Plunkett to Finch, 1 wide slides down leg Wood to Finch, 1 leg bye back of a length, takes the thigh pad to the leg side Ali to Finch, OUT picks out deep midwicket! Stands still this time, opts for the leg side, heaves across the line and clubs it down the throat of Bairstow Rashid to Marsh, OUT through him! Nicely done from Rashid. Another one that goes straight on, Marsh giving himself a touch of room, misses the drive and the ball tickles leg stump Woakes to Stoinis, OUT finds mid-off! Back of a length, aiming to club it down the ground, doesn't get the elevation and Root grabs it coming forward Wood to Paine, 1 leg bye gets a bottom edge as he swings to the leg side, dribbles behind him through his legs...ah, not quite through the legs! Rebounds off a delicate area. Ouch Plunkett to Paine, OUT well judged on the rope! As calm as you like from Moeen. A short ball, goes for the pull, gets a top edge, Moeen, at deep backward square, is in the shadows which are starting to come across the ground but knows exactly where the Starc to Roy, SIX runs short, and a steepling top-edge, high and mighty over the keeper's head! Plops onto the sightscreen, and though the runs keep flowing, Australia aren't unhappy to see Roy beaten for pace Starc to Roy, 1 wide short and wide, and called as such Cummins to Hales, OUT short, and a miscued pull, as Hales ducked into his pull as he realised he'd been beaten for pace. A simple catch pops up to short midwicket, and Australia are very much in the hunt now... Zampa to Roy, 1 wide that comes out a little wrong, very wide outside off Tye to Roy, 1 leg bye pushed into the pads, deflects wide of the keeper Zampa to Roy, SIX runs too short, hoisted and that's more handsome! Clean over the ropes at wide long-on, to end a probing over with a dismissive thwack! Tye to Roy, 1 leg bye worked to leg once more Starc to Roy, OUT short, pulled, top-edged, gone! The end of a triumphant innings from Roy, the MCG rises as one to a brilliant performance. A bit of a tired ending, went for the big humpty over the leg side, but ended up with a lobbed chance to backwa Cummins to Buttler, 1 wide banged in short, too short for the umpire's liking 10.25pm So, that sums things up from the first ODI. Have a read of Dan Brettig's match report before you go, and we'll see you at the Gabba for Match 2 out of 5 in what promises to be a high-octane ODI series. England won by 5 wickets (with 7 balls remaining) Player of the match is Jason Roy, ENG","England 5 for 308 (Roy 180, Root 91*) beat Australia 8 for 304 (Finch 107, Stoinis 60, Marsh 50, Plunkett 3-71) by 5 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details With an Aaron Finch century at the top of the order, a staunch middle-order partnership and acceleration at the end, Australia seemed pretty well placed at the halfway mark of the first ODI. That expectation was turned dramatically on its head by a rampant Jason Roy, who soared to England's highest ever 50-over score, and in the company of a rejuvenated Joe Root helped England fly to the steepest ever ODI chase on the MCG with seven balls to spare. If this was the first match of a series lacking much in the way of context, Roy's combination of daring and determination - with a dash of good fortune via numerous skiers that landed safely - will allow England to look optimistically towards next year's World Cup. It was on this ground, of course, where Australia had thrashed England in the opening match of the previous tournament, setting the scene for their ultimate success. This time around, England showed themselves to be at the vanguard of the new ODI breed, while Australia, with eight losses from their past nine games, look some way off the pace."
"Stanlake to Guptill, 2 wide short outside off, swings away as Guptill chases it, Alex Carey is also on the move and the ball ends up at third man for a couple of extras Stanlake to Munro, 1 leg bye fired into the pads, Munro looks for his favoured leg-side pick up but doesn't connect... pitched outside, I think Agar to Guptill, SIX runs tossed up and spanked back over long-on first ball! Guptill steps out and climbs into the spin, only just clears the short, straight boundary Stanlake to Guptill, OUT got him, toe-ended to mid-off! Backed away to try and thrash down the ground, completely mistimed and Warner revs the chainsaw in celebration. Stanlake with the breakthrough, Guptill goes (relatively) cheaply this time Kane Richardson to Munro, OUT straight up this time, and taken at mid-on! Munro holes out, Agar pouching it safely as Richardson gives it the double-fist pump. Maybe a bit of pace off there... NZ momentum well and truly checked now Agar to Williamson, OUT timber! Tossed up by Agar, gets him trying to come down the ground, nowhere near the pitch and an ugly swipe leaves Williamson stranded, the ball thudding into off stump! Nicely bowled, this wasn't a dart - gave it some air and duped the batsman Agar to Chapman, OUT tossed up and Chapman attempts to sweep, hit on the front pad - and given! After a moment's discussion, he decides to review, however... Looked pretty good to me, but maybe going on with the angle from round the wicket? No bat involved, it pitched in line and ball-tracking says it would have smashed off stump! Good Agar to de Grandhomme, OUT baits the hook, De Grandhomme bites... picks out cow corner! No great connection and there's a man out there waiting, the safe hands of Glenn Maxwell and Agar has a third wicket! Really not though through, that shot... NZ five down Stoinis to Seifert, OUT bowled 'im! Slips in the yorker again, seemed to go under the bat - in fact, Seifert just played the wrong line - and the ball thudded into the base of off stump. Good bowling, Australia applying the chokehold here Tye to Santner, OUT short and leg side, flies through as Santner pulls - was there glove on it? Yes! Tye banged in a fast bumper, Australia celebrated immediately and up went the finger. Oh dear Tye to Sodhi, SIX runs full, slower ball, Sodhi spots it - and booms six more over long-on! Hefty whack and it goes waaaaay back into the crowd! Good start Tye to Taylor, 1 leg bye banged in, 135kph and Taylor pulls like a lusty stevedore, takes it on the helmet, just a single to backward point! It's not much more than a hill of beans but Taylor has at least given NZ something to bowl at Southee to Short, 1 leg bye winding up for another big hit, but this time strikes the pads 10.17pm I'm afraid it is still hammering down. We could be set for an unsatisfactory conclusion here, but fingers crossed. Australia in utter control of DLS, so it's NZ who need to get back out there and takes lots of wickets Warner, who is set to board a stupid o'clock plane to South Africa tomorrow, collects the T20 Trophy, and that concludes the formalities. Thanks for tuning in - next up, we've got the ODI series between New Zealand and England, starting on Sunday. See you then. Player of the match is Ashton Agar, AUS","Australia 121 for 3 (Short 50) beat New Zealand 150 for 9 (Taylor 43*, Agar 3-27) by 19 runs (DLS method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details After the boom at Eden Park, swiftly came the bust. Five days on from Australia's world-record T20 chase, New Zealand opted to set a target again; this time, after an excellent bowling display on a less-frisky surface, the requirement over 120 balls was almost 100 runs fewer. D'Arcy Short capped an excellent debut series by crunching his second T20I fifty and the match descended into a hit'n'gurgle as the rain swept in for a second time. That Australia did not have to resort to the spectacular with the bat was down to a canny display with the ball. Where 32 sixes had streaked the Auckland skies when these two teams met in the group, the tally barely managed double-figures in the final."
"6.30pm New Zealand won the toss and will bat. Mitchell Santner is out with a knee problem and he's replaced by Ben Wheeler Stoinis to Munro, 1 wide banged in, climbing through well over the batsman's head Stoinis to Munro, 1 leg bye full on the pads, whipped fine for one Short to Munro, SIX runs tossed up and smeared over long-off! Munro goes to fifty with a six, too! Clean drive through the line, almost into the second tier - never mind the small boundaries! Tye to Munro, SIX runs three in a row!!! This one is massive! Swung over midwicket, goes about 15 rows back into the crowd, Tye being collared here Agar to Seifert, OUT Agar baits the trap, and Seifert picks out deep square leg! Hitting towards the longer part of the ground, against the spin and the connection wasn't good, sailed down the throat of Finch, who holds it safely Tye to Guptill, 1 wide fired wide of the off-side line Tye to Guptill, OUT got him, slogged into the leg side! Guptill finally plinks one short of the rope, Tye gets another, although it was close to being a no-ball... Swung towards deep midwicket from high on the bat and Maxwell again takes the catch coming in off the rope Stanlake to Chapman, 1 wide goes round the wicket, slides a full ball down the leg side Stanlake to de Grandhomme, 1 leg bye back of a length, taking the pace off again and De Grandhomme takes it on the body trying to swing up and over fine leg Stanlake to Chapman, OUT oof, that's a blow on the helmet - and it's knocked clean off his head and into the stumps! Very unfortunate for Chapman, he's unhurt but he is out... Reminiscent of Pietersen getting out against WI a decade ago, the helmet slipped straight off his head and bounced into the wicket. Stanlake strikes, closing out a decent over Stoinis to Guptill, SIX runs short now, Guptill swings savagely, lands the ball on the rope at long-on - that's his century, from 49 balls! Second T20I hundred for Guppy. Think it was a slower ball but it went pretty quickly to the fence, even though he was off balance Kane Richardson to de Grandhomme, OUT bowled 'im! De Grandhomme clears the front leg but is done by the slower ball, thick-edges into his back leg and on to the stumps! Another wicket at the death, Richardson snaffles the dangerous Bigman Tye to Taylor, 1 wide slung wide of the stumps as Taylor steps down Wheeler to Warner, 1 wide another extra ball as a full delivery is pushed down the leg side, trying to cramp Warner for room Wheeler to Warner, SIX runs over the straight boundary, a back-of-a-length ball which he swings off the front foot over mid-on Southee to Warner, SIX runs that's ridiculous! He's chipped it for six, barely any power. All timing. A full delivery, a little flick of the wrists sends it over mid-off Southee to Warner, SIX runs over the leg side, into the second tier! Short, pulled over deep square leg...91 off the Powerplay! Sodhi to Lynn, 1 wide turn outside off, drives and misses...called wide de Grandhomme to Short, 1 wide very wide outside off, barely on the cut strip...New Zealand have offered up too many extras de Grandhomme to Finch, 1 wide a slower short ball, allows it to loop through to the keeper and gets the wide call Australia won by 5 wickets (with 7 balls remaining) Player of the match is D'Arcy Short, AUS","Australia 245 for 5 (Short 76, Warner 59) beat New Zealand 243 for 6 (Guptill 105, Munro 76) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Eden Park was transformed into a T20 batting paradise as Australia pulled off a world-record run chase in Auckland, reducing Martin Guptill's 49-ball hundred - and a host of other records - to a footnote. D'Arcy Short and David Warner hammered aggressive fifties to set the tone of the reply and Australia's middle order kept the pedal to the metal at a stage where New Zealand had stuttered to seal victory with more than an over to spare. The stands were peppered for 32 sixes - equalling the T20I record - as the odd-shaped boundaries at Eden Park produced a lop-sided match in which batsman were able to swing with impunity and bowling became an exercise in damage limitation. No team had successfully chased as many in all T20 cricket. Aaron Finch and Alex Carey celebrate Australia's record-breaking win AFP New Zealand were left to rue a passage at the back end of their innings when they didn't score a boundary for 18 balls, but the point at which the game tipped decisively came in the 17th over of the chase."
"6.50pm: Australia win the toss and bowl, Warner continues with his 100% record at the toss and exercises the option to chase again. Aaron Finch is fit to return at the top of the order, with Travis Head making way. England have made a couple of changes, with Morgan missing out: Vince is his replacement, while Liam Dawson brings another spin option, Mark Wood the man to make way. Stanlake to Malan, 1 wide banged in very short, all height and no trousers this time, not troubling the batsman Kane Richardson to Roy, OUT slightly short, Roy hangs back and tries to guides to third man - but nicks it to the keeper instead! Richardson strikes now, bit of a freebie as Roy got a bit casual rather than going hard, scraped the toe of the bat through to Carey. England two down early Tye to Vince, OUT bowled 'im! Vince suckered by the slower ball! Loopy, seductive knuckleball from Tye but Vince never picked it, backing away to try and lash through cover, the ball dips to hit off and send him on his way Tye to Billings, 1 wide out the front of the hand but this swerves outside the tramlines Stanlake to Billings, OUT gone - slugged into the air and Warner takes it at mid-off! Billings' brief flurry is dealt with, Stanlake is a hard man to hit down the ground often, this was just too quick and his cross-batted mow lobbed up off the top edge Stanlake to Buttler, 1 wide moves across looking for the ramp, fired leg side Kane Richardson to Willey, OUT got him, top-edged into the covers! Richardson took the pace off and Willey's big heave only succeeds in giving him the heave ho... Warner again calmly underneath to complete the dismissal Willey to Lynn, 5 wide round the wicket, gets it wrong, speared full down the leg side, and also evades a diving Buttler Jordan to Short, 1 wide down the leg side, poor line Rashid to Maxwell, SIX runs over long-on! This isn't going to last long...stays in his crease this time, it's a full delivery, times it over the fence Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 wide a slower ball dragged down the leg side Australia win by seven wickets and are in the tri-series final. That's a thrashing for England. So it's a race between them and New Zealand to join the Aussies at Eden Park. Australis superb from start to finish today, never let England get away in the field and closed out the chase in style. They put the pitch in perspective, not half as tricky as England made it look. There's some pondered for Eoin Morgan (injured today) and Trevor Bayliss Australia won by 7 wickets (with 33 balls remaining) Player of the match is Kane Richardson, AUS","Australia 3 for 138 (Maxwell 39, Short 36*) beat England 7 for 137 (Buttler 46, Richardson 3-33) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia suffocated England with the ball and hammered them with the bat to register three Twenty20 wins from three games and secure a place in the triangular series final as the series moves to New Zealand after the match at the MCG on Saturday night. In front of a crowd of 42,691 for the closing fixture of the international summer, the Australians galloped to their target with 33 balls to spare, as Chris Lynn, D'Arcy Short and Glenn Maxwell all contributed. The fit-again Aaron Finch then put an exclamation mark on the result with a pair of mighty sixes off the bowling of David Willey, after he had been demoted to No. 5 to allow the younger Short to continue his impressive audition alongside the stand-in captain David Warner. Another low score for Warner was just about the only trouble spot for the Australians, with Billy Stanlake, Kane Richardson, Marcus Stoinis, AJ Tye and Ashton Agar all bowling exemplary spells with the ball."
"Agar to Hales, OUT round the wicket, angled in and straightening, pops off the leading edge - and Agar dances around Malan backing up to take a smart low catch! He lost sight of it momentarily but took it without drama. Australia break through Maxwell to Morgan, OUT got 'im! Morgan goes for a hasty swipe down the ground and top edges to the edge of the ring! Nicely bowled by Maxwell, tossed it up a bit more, Morgan wasn't to the pitch and mishit the ball straight up, Warner steadying himself well at mid-off to take the catch Stoinis to Buttler, OUT fullish, 129kph in the channel... and Buttler plops it straight into the hands of mid-off! Caught in two minds, I think, not a full-blooded drive, maybe duped by a cutter and he ended up chipping it to man on the ring Stoinis to Malan, 1 wide slower bouncer, Malan watches it through outside off... called wide, though Stanlake to Rashid, OUT banged in short, Rashid pulls and picks out deep square leg! Looked like Rashid was through his shot early, maybe expecting it to be quicker, and it flew off the toe of the bat straight to Stoinis, who clasped it low down in front of him Stanlake to Jordan, 1 leg bye quick, sliding in with arm, hit on the thigh hanging back Stanlake to Tom Curran, SIX runs wallop! Curran hooks his first ball into the crowd at deep square leg! Dug in short by Stanlake, 138kph but there's no mucking about and he mows it several rows back Tye to Tom Curran, OUT does him for (lack of) pace and Curran is gone second ball! Trying to whack it down the ground, completely foxed by the knuckleball and chipped to Warner backpedaling from mid-off Agar to Billings, OUT tossed up, grip and spin, Billings' leading edge this time goes straight back to the bowler! Australia chipping away, a second return catch for Agar, this one even more straightforward. Billings frowns to himself and strides off Maxwell to Malan, OUT tossed up and Malan slog-sweeps... picks out deep backward square leg! Maxwell strikes again and England's anchor is sunk, Malan safely pouched just in front of the rope for a round 50 Maxwell to Willey, OUT stumped, Willey loses his head! And his wicket... A misbegotten charge and Carey whips off the bails, Willey nowhere near getting his foot back Tye to Jordan, SIX runs Jordan whups it into the stands it deep midwicket! Stand and deliver, a meaty hoick across the line and it takes England past 150 in the process. But will that be competitive? 9.10pm: Well, England did okay to see out the overs, in the end. But having been 94 for 2 in the 10th, they didn't exactly soar through the second half. Can they learn from how Australia bowled (and will they rue leaving out Liam Dawson's spin)? David Warner certainly kept the batsmen on their toes, making a bowling change every over Willey to Maxwell, 1 wide swing again, but down the leg side Willey to Short, SIX runs pow! That is vast, picks the length so early, and pounds a high handsome swing into the stands at square leg Tom Curran to Short, SIX runs another slower ball, but too short this time from Curran, and Short has all the time in the world to size up his swing of the blade and dump a massive six over the bowler's head. A dent in an otherwise decent over Willey to Maxwell, 1 leg bye deflects off the legs, well gathered by Willey in his followthrough, and his shy pings the stumps! Safely home though ... Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye full length once again, flicks the pads and worked to leg Wood to Maxwell, SIX runs swung mightily over the leg side, and it plops over the rope for the century! Stunning batting from the Big Show who, frankly, was the only show in town today. 11.03pm Well, that was fun. What a display from Maxwell. Without him, it could conceivably have been close, but with him on top form, it was a rout. He picked the slower balls like a bowl of cherries, and for the first time in T20I history, a player has made a hundred and claimed three wickets in the same match. Let's give David Will Australia won by 5 wickets (with 9 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 5 for 161 (Maxwell 103*, Short 30, Willey 3-28) beat England 9 for 155 (Malan 50, Maxwell 3-10, Agar 2-15) by 5 wickets An outstanding allround display by Glenn Maxwell drove Australia to two wins from as many matches in the T20 triangular series, after England squandered a powerful start to their innings having been sent in by the hosts' stand-in captain David Warner. Wickets were followed by runs to guide the Australians home for the second time in as many matches, though Maxwell was fortunate to be reprieved when 53 were still required with six wickets in hand. Lofting Adil Rashid down the ground, he appeared to be caught low down by Jason Roy, but stood his ground for the third umpire to grant Maxwell a second chance as television replays were, as they so often are, inconclusive. He made the most of it, striking a six to win the game and also reach three figures. Whatever their thoughts about the catch, England had been wasteful in slipping from 1 for 60 after six overs to only 9 for 155, restricted largely by the spin bowling of Maxwell and Ashton Agar, plus the slower-ball variations of Kane Richardson and AJ Tye."
"6.50pm Australia have won the toss and will bowl Kane Richardson to Guptill, 1 wide down the leg side first up, a wide to get things going Stanlake to Munro, OUT strikes first ball! The short one. Munro goes for the pull, onto him too quickly, takes a big top edge and Carey moves around to the short fine-leg position to gather a simple chance. Probably not short enough for the stroke Stanlake to Guptill, OUT what a ball! He's on a hat-trick! Good length at off stump, nips off the seam, beats the outside edge and takes the top of off stump. That's a beauty Kane Richardson to Williamson, 1 wide pushed down the leg side, another wide, Richardson hasn't settled yet Stanlake to Bruce, OUT and he has three! Another short ball. Well directed, over middle and off, Bruce can't control his hook, takes a top edge and is very well judged on the long-leg boundary Tye to Santner, OUT that's very high, and doesn't get further than deep midwicket...full and straight, Santner trying to go over the leg side, pace off the ball again, can't get anything like enough distance Tye to de Grandhomme, SIX runs takes advantage of the extra delivery as he flicks this high over deep square leg Tye to Williamson, OUT huge wicket! Tye strikes second ball. Short of a length at off stump, Williamson looking to work into the leg side, closes the face and the ball takes a leading edge. Loops over cover, Warner turns and takes it comfortably over his shoulder Tye to Southee, OUT shuffling around the crease, it's a low full toss at 135kph, very sweetly flicked but he picks out deep square leg...taken very low by his bootlaces Tye to Sodhi, OUT and cleans him up with the last ball...full at off stump, Sodhi swings across the line. Tye finishes with four New Zealand have limped to 9 for 117. It's been all Australia apart from a few blows from Colin de Grandhomme who could only face four balls in the last two overs. Billy Stanlake set the tone with pace at the top of the innings, his three early wickets setting the innings back, while Andrew Tye showed all his stills and Ashton Agar was also very ""What's with NZ's bowling line up?! One medium-fast in Southee and spin with part-timers to make up the numbers, why not give Ferguson a crack on fast Aussie wickets?"" I think you've missed Trent Boult there, Fred? Couple of new-ball swingers and then pace off probably not the worst plan on this deck... But you'd prefer to be defending 157 Boult to Warner, OUT bouncer, Warner swings it leg side... and Bruce juggles the catch smartly on the rope! Went right down his schooner but he was off balance, had to step back over the boundary, but had the presence of mind to lob it up and get back inside the playing area to complete the dismissal. Two in two for NZ and this chase has j Southee to Maxwell, 1 wide short and down the leg side Australia won by 7 wickets (with 21 balls remaining) (D/L method) Player of the match is Billy Stanlake, AUS","Australia 3 for 96 (Lynn 44, Maxwell 40*) beat New Zealand 9 for 117 (Tye 4-23, Stanlake 3-15) by seven wickets (DLS) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia launched the inaugural T20 Tri-series with an emphatic curtain-raising victory over New Zealand at Sydney, hunting down a rain-reduced target of 95 in 11.3 overs, after their bowlers had proven too aggressive and constraining for their meek opposition. Despite a top-order wobble, in which David Warner and the debutant D'Arcy Short fell inside the first three overs, the belligerent power of Chris Lynn and Glenn Maxwell soon assumed utter control of Australia's chase. With a series of scything blows, particularly through the covers, Lynn set the initial tempo, en route to 44 from 33 balls, while Maxwell soon found his own range with a ramped four over the keeper's head followed by a planted front-foot six off the medium pace of Colin de Grandhomme. Lynn picked up his solitary six of the night when he belted Mitchell Santner on the up through midwicket, but he eventually fell in pursuit of his second when, with eight runs required for victory, he scuffed a pull to backward square leg off a Trent Boult bouncer."
"Russell to Wade, 1 wide full and sprayed very wide outside off McCoy to Wade, OUT done him! Terrific from McCoy. It's another slower one, a cutter at 119kph, full at off stump, Wade moving well outside leg stump and then misses his booming swing Bravo to Marsh, 1 wide full outside leg stump, huge appeal for caught behind! Umpire is unmoved. Pooran has called for the review. No spike as the ball passes the bat..and then the late call of a wide Allen to Marsh, OUT big appeal and given! Marsh went a long way across his crease then brought out the sweep, a very full delivery, he certainly looked in front of all three Walsh to Finch, OUT skier goes a mile high to deep midwicket and a ricochet off Bravo results in an acrobatic, and very alert, catch by Allen on the rebound! This was a classic leggie's wicket off the bat. Flighted loopy and full on sixth stump to tempt Finch into an almighty slog sweep, but the extra bounce results in a skier swirling over wide long-on. Bravo ranged 25 yards to his right and was in position for the take but may have slightly been distracted by Allen coming across in his eyeline from deep midwicket. Bravo bobbles the chest high chance five yards Cottrell to Henriques, 1 wide wide yorker, way too wide outside the guidelines and wide called. Bravo to Henriques, OUT shin height full toss on off stump, Henriques tries to heave this over midwicket but it comes too low off the bat nearer the toe and is hitting into the wind as well, doesn't get the distance and Allen comes in off the deep midwicket rope 10 yards to take this catch lunging forward at ankle height. Not nearly as dramatic as the rebound effort off of Bravo's hands earlier in the same spot but still a sharp take nonetheless. 8.56 pm Another miserly display by the West Indies bowling unit backed up by some tremendous fielding from start to finish. Australia once again finish with what looks like a well-under par total. With Agar missing this will be even more difficult to defend. Henriques now in the post-innings interview also concedes he thinks Australia are 20 short on this wicket. West Indies will be heavy favorites to chase this down. Stick with us through the break when Andrew McGlashan will take back over the central commentary position for the start of the West Indies reply. Meredith to Pooran, 1 wide slower bouncer over off stump, left alone, deemed too high for Pooran and called a wide. Meredith to Pooran, FOUR runs clinches the series win in style! Short ball creamed flat over midwicket, one bounce over the rope. Pooran howls in delight. The stand-in captain's record remains perfect. West Indies win by six wickets with 31 balls to spare to take a 3-0 series lead. West Indies won by 6 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) Player of the match is Chris Gayle, WI","West Indies 142 for 4 (Gayle 67, Pooran 32*, Meredith 3-48) beat Australia 141 for 6 (Henriques 33, Walsh 2-18) by six wickets So, those questions about Chris Gayle's form. The opener put on a thunderous display, with his first T20I half-century since 2016, to secure a series victory for West Indies as he pummelled the Australia attack around St Lucia in what became a cakewalk of a chase. Having made 102 runs in nine innings since his recall earlier this year, Gayle launched seven sixes in an innings that took him past 14,000 T20 runs. After he departed, stand-in captain Nicholas Pooran ensured there was no hiccup in the chase he closed it out with more than five overs to spare. It is the first time West Indies have won a bilateral series (or more than one match) against Australia in any format since 1995."
"Agar to Buttler, SIX runs down the pitch and another lovely clean strike over long-on, got perfectly to the pitch and the bottom hand whips through the shot Swepson to Buttler, OUT that's a massive drag down, but it's found deep midwicket! Swepson gets his first wicket. By accident or design, it's worked for the leggie. Didn't quite come off the surface, Buttler couldn't get the leverage he needed and it's a simple catch near the rope Swepson to Morgan, 1 wide pushes this across wide outside off and it's called wide Stanlake to Roy, OUT gone this time! Banged in short, Roy goes for the pull and gets a top edge it goes high in the air but no further than Finch at midwicket Swepson to Morgan, OUT he's found deep point with a reverse sweep! A shorter delivery from Swepson, means Morgan can't get over the top of it. Takes a big top edge and a simple catch for Tye Agar to Hales, SIX runs that's a huge blow down the ground! Stays in his crease and actually goes down on his back knee as he leverages this perfectly straight Stoinis to Hales, OUT what a catch! Would you believe it?! A bangs in a slower-ball bouncer, it ballons off the pitch, Hales swats it back towards Stoinis who sticks out his right hand and grabs a blinder Tye to Bairstow, 1 leg bye excellent stuff, a dipping slow ball, swinging across the line...an appeal for lbw, heading leg side perhaps Plunkett to Finch, 1 bye a whistling bouncer, goes through the batsman and the keeper too! They jog the single as Buttler turns to collect Ali to Finch, SIX runs plants the front foot, and drags a massive flat six over cow corner. That's more like it Ali to Finch, SIX runs kaboomed over cow corner to complete a lone-hand fifty!. If only he'd had more of the strike ... Ali to Finch, SIX runs full toss, and battered into the stands at midwicket! Finch is on a roll now! Ali to Finch, SIX runs pounded mightily into the crowd once more! Down on one knee, unfurling his levers, and targetting the floodlights! Rashid to Finch, OUT tossed up, a cuffed slog, and Jordan clings on brilliantly on the edge of the long-on rope! A solid base from a solid pair of hands, reached towards the rope with the ball coming over his shoulder and ends a brilliant captain's knock, and probably Australia's hopes too Rashid to Tye, SIX runs banjaxed into the stands! Deep in the crease, clears the front leg, and pounds it over cow corner! Willey to Agar, 1 wide wide outside off, but that looks a bit of a harsh call. Right on the guideline 10pm So that's a wrap from Edgbaston. On the day that Germany crashed out of the World Cup, England have sent their oldest cricketing foes home without a crumb of comfort. It's been quite the week for English sport... Next stop, it's India. See you then. Player of the match is Adil Rashid, ENG","England 221 for 6 (Buttler 60, Hales 49, Roy 44) beat Australia 193 (Finch 84, Rashid 3-27, Jordan 3-42) Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details Jos Buttler thumped the fastest half-century in his nation's T20I history to help England withstand a brilliant innings from Aaron Finch and record another resounding victory against Australia at Edgbaston. The result, coming on the heels of England's 5-0 victory in the ODI series, means Australia have lost all six international fixtures as part of their tour to England and Wales. They depart for a tour of Zimbabwe on Thursday. Buttler, promoted to open the innings after an excellent end to his IPL season in the same position, thrashed 50 from just 22 balls as England posted the second-highest total in their 101-match T20 history. Their highest T20I score remains the 230 made against South Africa in Mumbai in 2016, while the previous record for fastest half-century was 23 set by Ravi Bopara."
"10.15am: We'll have official news of the teams at the toss in about 15 minutes... but, word from the ground is that Sam Curran has received his ODI cap from James Anderson - so a debut for the Surrey allrounder. Will England make any more changes? If so, it'll most likely be to the attack, with Mark Wood a possibility to be rested. 10.40am: So, looks like Aaron Finch and Travis Head will open again, after their century stand up at Chester-le-Street, with Short slotting in down the order. No Glenn Maxwell, who presumably hasn't recovered from the shoulder problem that kept him out of the last game. England have a much-changed attack - but it's the batting that has done the damage in this series, as far as Australia are concerned. 10.55am: Australia did win on their last trip to Old Trafford, an eight-wicket canter in 2015, after England had chosen to bat. This England side has usually been capable of a bad day at the office - almost sackable, really - in any given series, and they were 8 for 5 in Adelaide in January, during the last series between these sides. Will that fallibility come to Australia's aid today? Ali to Finch, OUT got him, Moeen strikes - snuck through into the timber! What a good series he's having, this just gripped and spun, cramping Finch as he swung across the line, clipped the bottom edge and then rattled the stumps Plunkett to Head, OUT on the body, Head is tucked up and loops the ball straight to midwicket! He looks at his bat in frustration, Head falls after making an attractive fifty once again... Plunkett's modus operandi pays off, maybe bounced a bit more than expected and it was a simple catch for Morgan Ali to Carey, 1 wide tossed up and turning a touch, but that's wide of the tramlines Ali to Marsh, OUT Marsh reaches forward, overbalances and Buttler whips off the bails - is that a stumping...? Yes, superb bit of work from the keeper, Marsh's foot clearly dangling in the air as his weight went too far forwards Plunkett to Paine, 1 wide speared down the leg side Plunkett to Short, 1 wide back of a length, but down the leg side Sam Curran to Carey, OUT strikes first ball! Back of a length outside off, Carey has a nibble and it's a thin edge to Buttler. Just trying to steer it to third man. A maiden ODI wicket for Sam Curran Sam Curran to Agar, OUT oh my goodness! He's left a straight one It goes from bad to worse for Australia. He's shoulder arms to a delivery that has hit middle and off. Unbelievable. He must have thought it was going to swing away. It certainly didn't. Would even have been too close to leave if he had moved! Jeepers Sam Curran to Kane Richardson, 1 wide a bouncer, sails over Richardson's head, called a wide Rashid to Lyon, OUT and he's done him! Skids through slowly, Lyon goes back to play the pull, doesn't make contact and that's right in front although Lyon, at the last moment, calls the review. Don't think so, Nathan. His back leg is bent right in front of the stumps. Smashing leg stump. Ali to Stanlake, OUT and that's all over! Stanlake plays back outside leg stump, a shortish delivery slides on with the angle from round the wicket. He's not in the same postcode and it clatters leg stump. Career-best for Moeen Ali What a mess that was from Australia. All out with more than 15 overs unused. Most of the wickets handed on a plate to England. Spin again did plenty of damage and Sam Curran came back very nicely from an expensive start. Travis Head looked in good touch again before failing to convert, Alex Carey showed promise and D'Arcy Short did his best, but it was pretty dismal really. The innings has ended so swiftly that England will start Agar to Bairstow, 2 wide pushed down the leg side, Bairstow sweeps and misses... Paine can't grab it, didn't come off anything, so that's two wides to the total Stoinis to Rashid, 1 wide pushed down the leg side, flick and a miss... but that's a wide Kane Richardson to Buttler, 1 wide Richardson is getting a hint of reverse... but that has taken this down the leg side for a wide Stoinis to Buttler, SIX runs smashed down the ground, that's a huuuuuuuuuuuge six! Buttler slams a mighty blow back over everyone's head to go to his century! England need 5, but Ball will have to face the next over! England won by 1 wicket (with 9 balls remaining) Player of the match is Jos Buttler, ENG","England 208 for 9 (Buttler 110*, Stanlake 3-35, K Richardson 3-51) beat Australia 205 (Head 56, Moeen 4-46) Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details Jos Buttler gave Australia one last nightmare to take home from an abject ODI tour of England as the hosts squeaked to a victory that gave them a first-ever 5-0 sweep of a series between the two nations. Befitting the confidence gulf between the teams, Australia made the best possible start to both innings and squandered their advantage each time. England made the worst possible start in both innings and found a way to win. That they did so was largely due to Buttler, in the first innings of his ODI career to traverse more than 100 balls. Billy Stanlake's pace and hostility had reduced England to 50 for 5 in pursuit of 206 and they were no further than 114 at the fall of the eighth wicket."
"1.49pm Tim Paine won the toss to lift Australian spirits... has the mood change made it all the way to Samara? I think it might have, you know... Wood to Finch, 1 wide banged in short, over the shoulder Root to Finch, 1 leg bye full length, strikes the pad as well as bat, but the line from round the wicket makes the sweep a safe option Rashid to Head, OUT a dirty half-tracker, and tanked straight to the man at deep midwicket! Head is aghast, what a gruesome way to give it away. The long-hop lures him out of his cautious mindset, he seeks to clear the rope, and England have their opening! Ali to Marsh, SIX runs tossed up, Marsh goes down town... launched into the bleachers at long-on! Takes him to his half-century, a clean, crisp swing and fetched well back beyond the rope Wood to Finch, OUT oh, pinned him in front! Finch is plumb lbw playing across the line, Wood has the breakthrough out of nothing! It was all very placid out there, and now Finch has missed a straight one Wood to Stoinis, OUT bowled him! That is a beauty from Wood, shaping in, just a hint of reverse maybe, skidding through Stoinis's half-cocked defences. Had he got forward he might have had more chance ... of lbw Willey to Carey, OUT low full toss, swinging into the toes, and Carey holes out to deep midwicket! He nailed it, to be fair, but straight to the man. Willey to Neser, OUT edged, gone, and it's three in the over! Who says Willey isn't a death bowler? Neser makes room outside leg, feathers his off-side slap and Australia are subsiding rapidly Wood to Paine, 1 wide wider line, speared down the leg side this time Willey to Paine, OUT round the wicket, angled into the pads, and Willey strikes again! Another slog across the line, but was he struck outside the line? Paine can't be bothered to review... but that was umpire's call ... very marginal! Stanlake to Bairstow, OUT Bairstow falls! No fifth hundred in seven for England's other opener, he tried to get too cute against the height of Billy Stanlake, looking to glide him down to third man, but Paine saw him coming and snaffled a too-thin deflection Neser to Buttler, 1 wide sliding down the leg side England won by 6 wickets (with 32 balls remaining) Player of the match is Jason Roy, ENG","England 314 for 4 (Roy 101, Bairstow 79, Buttler 54*) beat Australia 310 for 8 (Marsh 101, Finch 100, Head 63, Willey 4-43) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details England have given themselves a great opportunity to inflict their first 5-0 ODI series whitewash on Australia after a six-wicket victory in Durham with 32 deliveries remaining. The result gave England a 4-0 lead with one game - in Manchester on Sunday - to play. It also meant that England have won eight of their last nine ODIs against Australia who have, in turn, won only two of their last 17 ODIs. While England won 4-0 in 2012, the third game in the series was lost to rain. It tells you how much ODI cricket has changed - and how quickly - that England's victory in this match seemed all but inevitable from the first moments of their chase."
"Australia win the toss and will bowl Stanlake to Roy, SIX runs he's nailed that one! No doubt that came out of the middle. Short again from Stanlake and it's a crunching pull over deep square leg Agar to Bairstow, 1 wide tries for a repeat of the short, misses out this time, ball skids down the leg side and is called wide Maxwell to Roy, SIX runs that's a mighty blow over long-on, he rocks back in the crease and heaves it with a straight bat down the ground. Hundred up for England Tye to Roy, SIX runs stand and deliver! An effortless, lofted straight drive as Tye goes full and it's into the stands over long-on Agar to Hales, 1 leg bye beaten! Hales is struck on the back pad, very adjacent to middle, but it seems to be sliding over Stoinis to Bairstow, SIX runs good lord, that is a clean strike! Very little wrong with the ball, but Bairstow stays leg side, frees the hands, and clubs it mightily over long-off! Tye to Morgan, 1 bye well bowled, gets a yorker under Morgan's bat, beats leg stump and then Paine palms it away Jhye Richardson to Hales, OUT taken at deep midwicket...Hales had just started to lose his shape in the last few minutes. He heaves a length delivery a long way into the air and it's comfortably taken Jhye Richardson to Morgan, OUT two wickets in two balls...Morgan tries to take this from outside off over the leg side, goes very high in the air and Paine settles under the catch Stoinis to Ali, 4 leg byes and the free hit is full outside leg stump, Moeen misses his flick but it deflects off the pad wide of Paine Wood to Head, 1 wide full outside leg stump, Head misses his flick and it's called a wide Willey to Short, 1 wide pushed down the leg side...another wide Willey to Head, 1 wide sliding down the leg side Willey to Marsh, 1 wide swinging down leg once more. A bit meh from Willey in this over Plunkett to Marsh, 1 leg bye very full, swinging into the pads, and they scamper the single Ali to Marsh, OUT hoisted high and mightily down the ground ... but Plunkett is perched on the rope, and swallows the opportunity! Just didn't quite get enough bat through the ball, and for all Australia's intent, they are in peril now Willey to Maxwell, 1 leg bye over the wicket, outside leg stump, takes the pad towards short fine leg and a poor piece of cricket allows an overthrow as Rashid throws at the stumps and it deflects away Willey to Maxwell, SIX runs a scoop for six! Moves well across his crease to a back-of-a-length delivery and sends it back over Buttler's head Rashid to Paine, OUT he's basically pulled a long hop to deep square! Good catch by Hales. A drag down from Rashid, Paine only had one man to beat on the leg side but couldn't keep the ball down and Hales moved to his right to snaffle the take Rashid to Agar, OUT well held! Rashid's good night continues, as he springs to his right to hold a sharp, low catch. Agar slices across the delivery slightly, came out the front of the hand, miscues it back down the pitch, Rashid takes it very neatly Player of the match is Alex Hales, ENG","England 481 for 6 (Hales 147, Bairstow 139) beat Australia 239 (Rashid 4-47, Moeen 3-28) by 242 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details England thrashed the highest score in the history of ODI cricket to set up the most crushing defeat - in terms of runs - ever inflicted upon Australia. On the same Trent Bridge ground where they plundered the previous record - 444 for 3 against Pakistan in August 2016 in the most recent completed ODI on the ground - England thrashed 21 sixes and 41 fours in becoming the first side to reach 450 in ODI history. Only once in the 56-year history of List A cricket - when Surrey scored 496 for 4 against Gloucestershire at The Oval in 2007 - has any side scored more. The result means England have taken an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Australia have now lost five ODI series in succession and eight of their last nine ODIs against England."
"10.10am There's a hint of light rain lurking around the ground this morning, but hopefully it'll all blow over by the start of play. Still 20 minutes to go until the toss. 10.40am Here comes the toss. But Eoin Morgan has had a back spasm. He is out of the game Jos Buttler will captain in his absence 10.47am Well, that was more dramatic than expected. Morgan's 69 was crucial to England's victory at The Oval. Two wicketkeeper-captains today, which is unusual. 10.58am Right, let's play some cricket. Out come the England openers, and you suspect that Jason Roy in particular will be grateful not to have Stanlake bearing down on him. Jhye Richardson is rapid though... this will be fun. Kane Richardson to Bairstow, OUT tighter line, Bairstow has a swish, and nicks through to the keeper! Bairstow was a victim of over-confidence there, looking to leather everything in his slot, but picking the wrong shot for that ball. The switch of ends works, and Australia have a toe-hold! Jhye Richardson to Hales, OUT oh, ripped through 'im! Richardson spears Hales with the perfect line and length, through the gate to hit the top of middle! That's Kryptonite for Hales, seaming in and sending him back to the hutch for a middling score Kane Richardson to Roy, 1 wide back of a length, 81mph and sliding down the leg side for a wide Stoinis to Root, OUT pulled flat hard into the deep - but D'Arcy Short dives forward to hold a blinder! Stoinis celebrates, but credit to the catcher, a fine bit of work on his debut! Root had skipped down as the ball was banged in short, he tried to get on top of an aggressive panhandle through midwicke Tye to Roy, OUT that, on the other hand, will do very nicely! A cross-seamer from Tye, zipping into the right-hander, catching the toe of the bat as it does so, and what a take from Paine! Changing direction to fling himself down the leg-side, and grabbing in one hand. Quite the recovery from his blow in Jhye Richardson to Buttler, 1 leg bye slower ball, short of a length, into the body, deflects to leg Tye to Billings, 1 wide swinging down the leg side, another extra to the cause Tye to Billings, OUT inside-edge onto the stumps! The slower ball does for Billings ... he never got going really, failed to pick the variation and shivered his own timbers Kane Richardson to Willey, OUT banged in short again, and Richardson does brilliantly to hurtle out to point in his followthrough to complete the caught and bowled! England's flaccid finale continues Tye to Plunkett, 1 wide sharp bouncer ... good thinking, but it's too short as Plunkett tries to wipe one off his eyebrows Tye to Plunkett, OUT whoops, a mistimed wipe to the leg side, a non-existent single, but Plunkett figures it's better to get Buttler back on strike. He's not even in the frame as the bails are whipped off. Fair play! Wood to Head, SIX runs bumper, 89mph and Head plays this beautifully, flicking up his hands at the last minute to send the ball sailing into the sight screen over the keeper's end Wood to Head, OUT flicked into the leg side, uppish but dying in front of midwicket... where Hales scoops up a brilliant one-handed catch! That is a superb effort, throwing himself forward and low to his right! They are going to check with the TV umpire, but the soft signal is out. Yep, Dharmasena is happ Ali to Short, OUT bit of turn, Short plays back, edged and snapped up at slip! Moeen strikes again, he's enjoying bowling to Australia... Short hadn't looked particularly adept, he had his struggles in the IPL, of course, and now he's heading back for 21 off 33 on ODI debut Wood to Maxwell, 1 leg bye on the pads, worked to the leg side Wood to Maxwell, 1 leg bye sliding into the pads on a full length, no room to free the arms Root to Marsh, 1 leg bye lobbed up full and drifting leg side, Marsh sweeps and gets it away off the pads Plunkett to Agar, 1 wide fired down the leg side, Buttler appeals but he wasn't close to hitting that Wood to Paine, 1 wide length, sliding down the leg side, Buttler appeals for the catch... bit of kidology, as there was not bat involved Wood to Paine, 1 leg bye short and on the hips, deflected wide of the keeper Plunkett to Paine, OUT short ball, into the body and Paine flips it straight to fine leg! This time the catch is held, a short-lived cameo from Paine but while Marsh is still at the other end Australia can dream. Think that was a cutter from Plunkett, no pace for Paine to work with Plunkett to Marsh, OUT oh, GONE - bowled 'im! Plunkett hits the woodwork and Australia's best hope of winning walks off after a magnificent century. The crowd rises to applaud him up the steps, probably realising that wicket might have clinched the game... Slower ball from Plunkett, the cutter gripped an Player of the match is Jason Roy, ENG","England 342 for 8 (Roy 120, Buttler 91*) beat Australia 304 (Marsh 131, Plunkett 4-53) by 38 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details England's cricketers inflicted the final blow of a miserable day for Australian sport by taking a 38-run victory - and a two-nil series lead - in the Royal London ODI in Cardiff. On a day that had already seen Australia's male international teams lose to France (in the football World Cup) and Ireland (in a rugby union international), England registered the highest score they had ever made against Australia in ODI cricket and the highest score made in an ODI in Cardiff. It was enough to see Australia's cricketers suffer the same fate as their compatriots and means that England have now won seven of the last eight ODIs between these sides. It makes Scotland's success over England in Edinburgh a week ago seem ever more impressive. The result was a cruel return for Shaun Marsh after a hugely impressive innings."
"Wood to Finch, 1 wide pushes this one down the leg side Willey to Head, OUT full, lavish swing for Willey, that's nicked straight to slip on the drive! Head doesn't dally, he was looking to get on top but the ball moved a fair way from him, a loose shot having failed to size up the conditions, England have their breakthrough Ali to Finch, OUT tossed up invitingly, Finch opens his body to go up and over... but only skews a thick outside edge to short third man! England have got rid of the dangerous Finch, Australia's most-experienced batsman, trying to get on top of Moeen but miscuing against the spin Ali to Marsh, OUT bowled 'im! Moeen straightens one and Marsh plays the wrong line, he's off on the Bakerloo as the ball chugs down the Piccadilly to topple off stump. England on top, here Ali to Paine, OUT oh dear, what was that from Paine?! Makes a pre-meditated move outside off, brings out the reverse-sweep... and lobs a gentle top edge to short third man! He completely telegraphed his intentions, Buttler was almost far enough across to intercept the ball himself, but to compound that the execution was poor, hitting against the offspin, and he's gifted Moeen a third! Ali to Stoinis, SIX runs that breaks the shackles! Uses his feet then lofts high over long-on. A clean swing of the bat Rashid to Stoinis, OUT edged and gone! Caught behind...not the best ball Rashid has bowled, it's short outside off, Stoinis shapes to cut but can only managed a thin top edge to Buttler Plunkett to Agar, 1 wide short outside leg stump, called wide Rashid to Agar, OUT very full, Agar goes to sweep - misses and is plumb! Rob Bailey sends him on his way, no review from Agar, that struck him low down on the back pad as the ball straightened... only one place that delivery was ending up. Decent knock in adversity from Agar, but Australia are now seven down and in danger of not seeing out the overs Plunkett to Neser, OUT goes for the slog down the ground, the ball not full enough for the shot... and mid-off settles under it for a simple catch! Neser tries to hit out and instead gets out, a second wicket for Plunkett and this innings is ending rather like it started Wood to Kane Richardson, OUT pitched up, slapped to mid-off! Wood has a wicket, Richardson losing patience and picking out the man on the edge of the ring Plunkett to Tye, SIX runs another short ball, goes for it again - SPANKED! Tye gets hold of an old-fashioned mow across the line and pounds six over deep midwicket! Back atcha Plunkett to Tye, OUT takes the pace off, Tye dabs at it off the back foot... but only succeeds in tickling a low edge through to Buttler! He took that well, diving forwards, Tye shakes his head but his fun is over - time to think about bowling, with just 214 to defend Tye to Root, 1 wide slower ball, down the leg side, Root is miffed to miss out on a languid pull... looked like a flick of fabric there, but the umpire singles the wide Tye to Root, 1 wide a very short delivery outside off, Paine does well to grab it one handed with a leap and no surprise that's a wide England win by three wickets with plenty of time to spare. It's been one of their less convincing chases and for a little while it appeared they may stumble as they did against Scotland. But David Willey played calmly, an ODI career-best for him, and Australia were left to rue their own poor batting display. Eoin Morgan and Joe Root played nicely, but England's win was set up by the performance of their spinners e England won by 3 wickets (with 36 balls remaining) Player of the match is Moeen Ali, ENG","England 218 for 7 (Morgan 69, Root 50) beat Australia 214 (Maxwell 62, Plunkett 3-42 Moeen 3-43) by three wickets Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details They were handing out sandpaper boundary placards on the way up from Vauxhall Tube Station, but in the end, nothing could smooth away the rough edges in Australia's new-look batting line-up. Despite their rookie bowling attack mounting a spirited defence of a substandard target of 215, England overcame a double dose of jitters to seal a three-wicket victory in the first ODI at The Kia Oval. Most of the pre-series focus had, rightly, been on the absence of Australia's finest two batsmen, David Warner and Steven Smith, and, as might have been expected, they struggled to mitigate for that void in class. After winning the toss on a bright afternoon in South London, Australia mustered 214 in 47 overs, the sort of slow-death innings that exposed their shortcomings more comprehensively than a full-on batting collapse could have done. Nevertheless, England aren't without a few notable embarrassments in their (very) recent history, and only days after failing to close out a chase of 372 to hand Scotland a famous victory, they came improbably close to stumbling in pursuit of a target of barely half that height."
"Player of the match is Shimron Hetmyer, WI","West Indies 196 for 4 (Hetmyer 61, Bravo 47*) beat Australia 140 (Marsh 54, Walsh Jr 3-29) by 56 runs A superbly constructed century partnership between Shimron Hetmyer and Dwayne Bravo was the cornerstone of an impressive West Indies performance as they went 2-0 up against Australia. Having pulled victory from the jaws of defeat 24 hours ago this time a West Indies victory felt far more secure after they had posted a formidable 196 and removed Australia's openers cheaply.

"Shadab to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell swings one straight into the lap of Ali at long-on. Pushed through on middle stump, Maxwell winds up and golf-swings it straight to the man in the deep. Two wickets in three overs for Pakistan Shaheen Shah Afridi to Short, OUT on a length and outside off, Short flays it straight to cover. He stays leg-side of this ball and holes out to Farhan. No celebration from Afridi. Short lost his shape while meeting the ball Faheem to Head, SIX runs really full on middle, right in the slot, Head clears his front leg and walllllllllops it into the stands beyond midwicket. Brute power from Head Faheem to Carey, OUT Pakistan's fielding veers from ordinary to extraordinary. This rocket drive from Carey seemed destined to fly to the boundary. Instead, Shadab throws himself to his right from mid-off and plucks it out with one hand, inches from the ground. Simply sensational. This was very full and outside off, belted away in the air. Amir to Stoinis, OUT full-toss, angling away outside off, Stoinis is forced to reach out for the ball. He carves this low full-toss to sweeper cover, where Malik, after dropping Finch on 0 earlier in the morning, takes it with both hands Hasan Ali to Agar, (no ball) beamer, slips out of the hand, flies over the ducking Agar to Sarfraz. No-ball, of course. It did not pitch at all, flies into the hands of the keeper Hasan Ali to Agar, OUT bowled'em. That's a bail trimmer. Good length on off stump, Agar swings for the hills... and does not get bat on ball. Hasan clips the off bail to cap his spell with a wicket Amir to Head, OUT Australia continue to lose their way in the end over. Head holes out to long-on. On a length and outside off, Head swings and gets more height as opposed to distance Amir to Tye, OUT Killer yorker from Amir. It floors the middle stump. Ripper from over the wicket, storms under Tye's swinging bat. Can Australia reach 180? Maxwell to Sahibzada Farhan, 1 wide, OUT Duck for Farhan on T20I debut. What an unfortunate way to go, that too in your first international. Maxwell slides a full ball down the leg side, draws the batsman out of the crease, Farhan falls over, and the keeper whips the bails off. Stumped off a leg-side wide Maxwell to Talat, OUT Maxwell strikes twice in the first over with the new ball. Talat also gone for a duck. Maxwell tosses up this outside off and gets it to break away. Talat drives a long way away from the body and slices a catch to backward point. Dream start to the defence for Maxwell and Australia Wildermuth to Zaman, 1 wide short and wide outside off, looks like another slower ball, but it's well past the tramline Wildermuth to Zaman, 1 wide darted short and too wide outside off, another off-side wide from Wildermuth Wildermuth to Zaman, 1 wide back of a length and angling away outside past the tramline. Yet another off-side wide Stanlake to Zaman, 1 leg bye Fakhar moves away outside leg, Stanlake chases him with a full ball that grazes the pad and squirts away to fine leg Jhye Richardson to Malik, 1 wide leg-side wide Jhye Richardson to Zaman, OUT Zaman holes out to deep backward point. No hundred for him. Zaman shows his cards early and steps away outside leg. The bowler goes shorter and wider outside off. Zaman still reaches out for the ball and slices underneath the ball in the air but straight down the throat of Maddinson, the sub Pakistan won by 6 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Fakhar Zaman, PAK","Pakistan 187 for 4 (Fakhar 91, Shoaib Malik 43*) beat Australia 183 for 8 (Short 76, Finch 47, Amir 3-33) by six wickets It's been a curious week to schedule a T20I tri-series. What with the Wimbledon Championships kicking off and the World Cup approaching its enthralling climax, this T20 tri-series in Harare (which, as far as we can tell, doesn't really have a name) was never destined to be the highlight of July's sporting calendar. Having said that, it would have been hard to pick a week all calendar year where this particular series would take centrestage. But the series did provide something some of the world's biggest competitions fail to do. It provided a final to grace the occasion."
"9.30am Unchanged Australia have won the toss and are fielding first. Shaheen Afridi, one of their finds from the Under-19 World Cup this year, is playing his second T20I. Hassan Ali is out from yesterday's XI. Another change: Usman Khan in, Mohammad Nawaz out. Jhye Richardson to Talat, 1 wide steep bouncer, shaped to pull but let it go. Wide for bounce. Jhye Richardson to Talat, 2 wide slides this down leg, Carey doesn't stop it cleanly either. Maxwell to Talat, SIX runs striking right out of the top drawer. Stepped out, didn't get to the pitch but had the guts to hit through the line and loft inside-out over the cover boundary Maxwell to Talat, OUT beaten by one that slides in, cramps him for room and crashes into the stumps. Completely misread the line as he looked to cut. Good innings nonetheless from Talat Tye to Sarfaraz, OUT thick outside edge to this legcutter which he looks to loft over cover, Carey accepts the simple offering. Agar to Malik, SIX runs smashed straight into the sightscreen. Steps out, gets underneath the flight and times this magnificently. Stoinis to Zaman, OUT the party is over, he can only toe-end this pull as far as the edge of the ring at midwicket. Went for a biff across the line, ended up having to fetch it from too far outside. Stoinis to Malik, 1 wide wide yorker, reaches out to squeeze this but can't lay bat to it. Clever from Stoinis Tye to Malik, OUT lofted, but straight to cover. No power, tried to hit it too hard, got it off the bottom. The length did the trick, blockhole almost, Malik almost had to dig it out. Jhye Richardson to Asif Ali, SIX runs backs away, opens the bat face and slices this full delivery over backward point, excellent improvisation Jhye Richardson to Faheem, OUT this has been clobbered straight to Maxwell at long-off, he was a few yards in, this was struck fiercely. He needed some leeway there, in case he overbalanced in trying to take this, but he made it look very easy. Went along with the momentum, took a couple of steps back after taking the catch before steadying himself to Tye to Shadab, OUT pulled but can't clear long-on this time, Maxwell does well to move swiftly to his left, moves low and takes this inches from the ground. 11.35am This is an imposing total, one Pakistan will be delighted with after being put in to bat. Solid platform at the top courtesy Hussain Talat after losing a wicket first ball, the middle-overs acceleration coming from Fakhar Zaman, and the end-overs flourish courtesy Shoaib Malik and Asif Ali. Australia's fielding suffered and bowling very inconsistent. Usman Shinwari to Maddinson, 1 leg bye walks across to flick, the ball angles in and deflects off the thigh pad to square leg Shaheen Shah Afridi to Short, OUT the leg stump has been flattened and Afridi takes off on his celebration. Short's misery is over. Full, straight and honing in towards the stumps from wide of the crease, he went for a massive hit over long-on, couldn't connect to anything but air. Third wicket for Afridi. Usman Shinwari to Carey, SIX runs sparkling hit! This is a short-arm jab off a length delivery, sails over wide long-on, tremendous hand-eye coordination Usman Shinwari to Carey, 1 wide full toss angling down, swing and a miss, wide. Shaheen Shah Afridi to Tye, 1 leg bye looks to hoick this over square leg, played too early, ball deflects off the thigh pad into the leg side 1.20pm Having beaten Pakistan comfortably in their first meeting, the Australians put in an unfocused performance, dropping far too short with the new ball after Finch sent Sarfraz Ahmed's side in to bat to allow Fakhar Zaman to fire off a succession of pull shots on his way to the highest score of the match. They then lost a series of early wickets to the l Thanks for joining us. Hope to see you tomorrow for Zimbabwe-Australia. Until then, this is Shashank Kishore saying goodbye. Player of the match is Fakhar Zaman, PAK","Pakistan 194 for 7 (Fakhar 73, Asif 37*, Tye 3-35) beat Australia 149 for 7 (Carey 37*, Shaheen Afridi 3-37) by 45 runs Pakistan gained a mental advantage over Australia by dominating Aaron Finch's team in a match that served as a dress rehearsal for Sunday's Twenty20 triangular tournament final at the Harare Sports Club. Having beaten Pakistan comfortably in their first meeting, the Australians put in an unfocused performance, dropping far too short with the new ball after Finch sent Sarfraz Ahmed's side in to bat to allow Fakhar Zaman to fire off a succession of pull shots on his way to the highest score of the match. They then lost a series of early wickets to the late moving ball in the hands of Faheem Ashraf and the 18-year-old left-armer Shaheen Afridi. Having slid as low as 75 for 5, Australia never looked likely to get close to their target, though the wicketkeeper and vice-captain Alex Carey played another intelligent innings down the order. Pakistan's victory also served the purpose of preventing Australia from taking their place at the top of the ICC's T20 international rankings."
"9.30am Zimbabwe win the toss and elect to bowl. Mpofu in for Jarvis. Australia unchanged Nyumbu to Short, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw! But not given. Full on middle, but drifting down leg. Short misses the shot to midwicket and the ball hits his front leg Burl to Finch, SIX runs full outside off, and Finch goes down on one knee to meet this ball. Thumps it over the non-striker and the ball soars over the fielder at long on as well! Mire to Finch, SIX runs there's the record! Full toss on off, and that's been smacked into the cow corner boundary! Too easy for Finch. In the slot and punished Mpofu to Short, 2 wide full and wide outside off, and Short lets the ball go to the keeper. The keeper fumbles as well, and that allows Finch to get back on strike Muzarabani to Short, 1 wide full and wide outside off. Too wide, in fact Muzarabani to Short, OUT first wicket! Short slices this in the air, and the short ball does him in. Goes for the leg-side swipe, but he was through his shot too early. Taken by the keeper Finch: Feeling good. The wicket played better than we thought. It came on well. I knew about the records when I was batting, but a few things went my way today. I took the strike from Short a bit, but that kind of innings for him will also help him. When the wickets get slower and lower, that kind of innings will help. I Stanlake to Chibhabha, 1 wide short and wide outside off, but swinging further away from the batsman. He did try to cut, but can't get bat to ball Stanlake to Chibhabha, 1 wide taken aback by the bounce! But the umpire calls it a wide anyway. A testing length on middle stump but cramps the batsman for space. Goes over his left shoulder to the keeper Jhye Richardson to Chibhabha, OUT chopped on! Length ball outside off, but angling into the batsman. Tries to cut, and he under-edges this onto his pads. The ball ricochets off his pads and into Carey's gloves, and the umpire raises his finger to the keeper's appeal Short to Moor, SIX runs on the roof! Big end to the over. Short on middle, and Moor pulls this straight over Andrew Tye at long on. The crowd needs hard hats! Agar to Masakadza, OUT deceived by the length! Excellent ball from Agar to prise out the wicket. Saw Masakadza skipping down and dropped his length. The ball pitched outside off, and then spun further away, with the batsman halfway down the wicket. Carey collects in a flash, and wastes no time to whip the bails off 2pm That's all from us at ESPNcricinfo. What a memorable day for cricket. A record-breaking day as Australia secured their passage into the tri-series final. The cricket, however, does not stop at all. We'll be back, once again, tomorrow morning to bring you the fourth game of the series - between Zimbabwe and Pakistan. Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 229 for 2 (Finch 172, Short 46) beat Zimbabwe 129 for 9 (Tye 3-12, Agar 2-16) by 100 runs Rather than throw a kettle over a pub, it was Zimbabwe pasted all over the Harare Sports Club. Aaron Finch bludgeoned his way to within three runs of Chris Gayle's world-record Twenty20 score and bettered his own chart-topper in Twenty20 internationals as Australia cantered to a second victory in as many days in the triangular series in Harare. Placing his stamp on the tournament and Australia's short-form captaincy, Finch blazed 10 sixes in an opening stand of 223 - with a more subdued D'Arcy Short - that lasted until the final over of the visitors' innings after they were sent in by Zimbabwe. Left with three balls to make the four runs he required to set a new world record score in all T20 matches, Finch was dismissed hit wicket when aiming for one more mighty blow. Still, he walked off having delivered a comfortably match-winning total for his team."
"9.35am Australia win the toss and choose to bowl in Malik's 100th T20I Stanlake to Zaman, OUT Has Zaman been strangled down the leg side? Umpire Jeremiah Matibiri raises his finger. Zaman doesn't seem pleased but no DRS in this series to challenge the on-field out decision. Dug in down the leg side, rushes Zaman into a hook. There's a deflection - not sure if it was off the glove or bat - but Zaman has to exit. Three wickets in three overs for Stanlake Stanlake to Asif Ali, 1 wide bouncer, too high, wide called Stoinis to Asif Ali, OUT misreads the length and pays the price! This is not short enough to play a cross-bat shot. But that's what he does, looking to pull the quick, skiddy delivery through square leg. The reasonably good length ball zips through his defences and takes out off stump Agar to Shadab, 1 leg bye seeing the length ball drifting into the pads, Agar goes down to sweep, but he doesn't have enough room to properly free the arms Tye to Faheem, SIX runs launches it over deep square leg! Stoinis goes short and here he offers room for the left-hander to free the arms. And Ashraf absolutely loves it Jhye Richardson to Faheem, OUT Richardson bounces out Ashraf. Chest-high short ball angling across off stump from over the wicket, rushes the batsman into a hook. He only top-edges it hiiiiiiigh in the air. It drops down into the lap of Tye at fine leg Jhye Richardson to Nawaz, 1 wide back-of-the-hand slower ball but floated past the tramline, off-side wide Tye to Hasan Ali, 1 wide off-side wide Tye to Hasan Ali, OUT full-toss, wide outside off, Hasan Ali throws his bat at the ball and smears it straight to deep point. He holes out for a duck on his 24th birthday Tye to Nawaz, OUT Tye wraps Pakistan up for 116! Very full on middle and leg, not quite a yorker, Nawaz gets under the length. He swings, gets more height as opposed to distance. Agar sprints in from long-on, dives forward, and snaffles it Hasan Ali to Head, 5 wide full and sprayed down the leg side, past the flick, past the diving keeper Hasan Ali to Finch, 1 leg bye back of a length and angling into the hips, worked away between square leg and midwicket for one Nawaz to Finch, 2 wide Finch steps away outside leg, Nawaz fires it down leg side, the ball bursts out of Sarfraz's gloves 12.40pm Finch's fifty has made light work of this 117 chase. But, it was Stanlake who had set up this victory with 4 for 8 - the second-best T20I figures for Australia. He ran in hard, hit the pitch harder, and hustled Pakistan for pace and bounce. He has brought Pakistan's eight-match winning streak to a grinding halt. This is also Justin Langer's first win as Australia coach. Do stick around for the presentation. Australia won by 9 wickets (with 55 balls remaining) Player of the match is Billy Stanlake, AUS","Australia 117 for 1 (Finch 68*) beat Pakistan 116 (Shadab 29, Stanlake 4-8, Tye 3-38) by nine wickets Billy Stanlake is mobbed by his team-mates AFP One centimetre taller than Joel Garner's lofty 203, Billy Stanlake towered over Pakistan's top order at the Harare Sports Club in a spell that delivered Australia their first international victory in any format since the Newlands ball-tampering scandal, by nine wickets with a gaping 55 balls to spare. Making the most of what early-morning life existed in a dry surface, Stanlake blasted out the top-four Pakistani batsmen in a spell of 4 for 8, helped by three fine catches from his captain Aaron Finch, who had granted his young spearhead the chance to bowl first by winning the toss and kept him going for four consecutive overs. The game was more or less decided by Stanlake's burst, with all four wickets falling to catches behind the wicket. If Fakhar Zaman seemed nonplussed by his dismissal, adjudged caught down the leg side when attempting a hook shot at another high bouncing Stanlake projectile, then there was no broadcasting budget room for DRS to determine whether or not he was right to quibble. A pair of lbw appeals, by Jhye Richardson and Usman Khan, might also have attracted referrals."
"7.30pm Pakistan have won the toss, will bat first. Shinwari and Farhan in, Shaheen Afridi and Fakhar out Lyon to Babar Azam, 1 wide looks to whip this square, beaten. But there's too much turn. Lyon to Sahibzada Farhan, SIX runs down on one knee as he swings this over the bowler's head, clears the ropes effortlessly. Short to Babar Azam, 1 wide slower ball, but spinning after hitting the deck. Babar misses the flick Lyon to Sahibzada Farhan, OUT Tye holds on! Farhan wanted the release shot, but couldn't time it at all. Loses one hand on the bat, and the mistimed slice goes to long off Tye to Babar Azam, OUT another one! Chops on. Fuller outside off, and he drives away from his body. The ball zips in, and takes the inside of his bat. Massive wicket Zampa to Malik, OUT great response! Slower through the air, and spinning away. Malik looks to nudge it towards the leg side, but the leading edge takes it to Finch at cover Marsh to Asif Ali, OUT holes out! A brilliant catch from Coulter-Nile. This was full on off, and in the slot. It's Asif's misfortune that he couldn't get it off the bat's middle. The fielder tracks the ball with one eye and ensures his feet are inside Marsh to Faheem, OUT short on middle, and Faheem has pulled this down Tye's throat at deep backward square. Off the bat's top edge, and Tye makes no mistake despite the rain Faheem to Carey, 1 leg bye off the pad to the square leg region. Beaten for pace as he trued to tuck it away. Hafeez to Carey, OUT leading edge and it lobs to midwicket. Dolly of a catch. Hafeez drifts this in from round the stumps, Carey looked to nudge this into the leg side, closed the bat face early. This one just stopped on him a touch. Pakistan right bac Hasan Ali to McDermott, SIX runs class, quality, brute power, muscle and what else. Dropped short again, McDermott picked the length and swatted this away to clear deep midwicket Shadab to Lynn, OUT swept from outside off against the turn, but he only manages to hole out to deep midwicket. Fetched it from way outside off, no timing and he ended up dragging this. Poor choice of shot there. Wicket off his first delivery for Shada Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 1 leg bye looks to work this square, deflects off the pad int the leg side. Shadab to Maxwell, OUT straight to long on! Backs away and tries to thump a full-pitched ball into the stands, but it's come off the bat's toe-end, and it doesn't have the power to go beyond the boundary Shadab to Short, 1 wide length ball outside off, and the googly goes further away Shadab to Marsh, OUT chipped! To long on. Shoaib Malik dives forward to complete that catch. Length ball angling in, and cramping him for space. Can't free his arms, and he lobs it into the hands of the fielder manning the boundary Hasan Ali to Tye, OUT nine down! Full and quick, and Tye's attempted drive takes the inside-edge and straight into Sarfraz's gloves. That went so fast, and the keeper had to dive to his left in a flash Hasan Ali to Zampa, OUT Pakistan win 3-0! The 30th time they've bowled an opposition out in T20Is! Full on off, and he tried to muscle it over long off. No power behind that shot and the hosts are delighted Alex Carey took 20 off the first over. But one wicket is all it took for Pakistan to pop open the game as the spinners took over and applied the choke clinically. For now, it's a well-earned break for Pakistan, a very short one, before New Zealand come calli 11.10pm So a poor finish to a disappointing tour for Australia. For Sarfraz, this is the right tonic after a slew of poor captaincy decisions cast doubts over his authority over the side in the lead-up to the tour. He responded with two superb knocks in the Player of the match is Shadab Khan, PAK","Pakistan 150 for 5 (Babar 50, Farhan 39, M Marsh 2-6) beat Australia 117 all out (Shadab 3-19, Hasan 2-14) by 33 runs 0:57 The short story of an Aussie whitewash It shaped up as the most competitive match of the series, but in the end, Australia couldn't keep up with Pakistan. A 93-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan and Babar Azam - who top-scored for Pakistan yet again with 50 - took Pakistan to a total in a region that's been too good for Australia all series. This time they reached a square 150, and even though the visitors started brightly - Imad Wasim was dispatched for 20 in the first over - the pressure of Pakistan's bowling took its toll on Australia. Aaron Finch's men ended up comfortably second best, bowled out for 117. That's what they've been in comparison to Pakistan all tour, and that's how they go home."
"7.30pm Pakistan have won the toss and chosen to bat Maxwell to Babar Azam, 1 wide length ball outside leg, and Carey takes a sharp collection behind the stumps Coulter-Nile to Zaman, OUT backs away, but misses! Coulter-Nile thinks there's an edge. The bowler is convinced, Carey not so much, but Finch reviews anyway. Fakhar had backed away, and Coulter-Nile had followed him with a short ball aimed at his body. Extra bounce forced Fakhar to miss, and the ball went ju Zampa to Hafeez, SIX runs welcomes Zampa with a maximum! Tossed up outside off, and he walks down the wicket to smack this right over the bowler's head Stanlake to Hafeez, OUT pulled straight to deep square leg Short ball, rising up to pulling height near the shoulders and Hafeez got hold of that well. However, his placement was completely off, and he picked out D'Arcy Short with precision. Short to Babar Azam, OUT Finch holds a smart catch on the long-off boundary He knew he had to accelerate, and tried to go big, Got hold of the ball, but not quite well enough. Finch kept calm right on the ropes and held the ball over his head without disbalancing. Stanlake to Asif Ali, OUT clobbered straight to the man on the point fence back of a length on off, he timed it pretty well, but it went straight to D'Arcy Short. Coulter-Nile to Faheem, 1 leg bye struck on the pads, but perhaps too high. Goes for the quicker one, and the batsman is late on his flick Coulter-Nile to Malik, OUT Pakistan are falling away a bit Malik cleared his back leg and tried to go over the in-field, but no timing again - and Mitch Marsh at mid-off holds on comfortably Coulter-Nile to Hasan Ali, OUT Mitch Marsh juggles and holds on No batting heroics from Hasan Ali this time. Mid-off was up, and he bowled a full length delivery. Hasan cleared his leg and swung, but got only the toe-end to it. The ball was going behind Marsh. He ran back, arms outstretched, got the ball in Tye to Faheem, 1 leg bye tried to repeat the previous shot, but was late on it, and the ball trickles to short third man. Imad Wasim to Short, 1 leg bye full outside leg stump, and Short can't work it towards the leg side. Hits his front pad, and dribbles away to the off side Faheem to Lynn, SIX runs swatted! Full on off, and muscled right over long on! Into the second tier from Lynn. Classy way to get off the mark Shaheen Shah Afridi to Marsh, 1 leg bye good length outside leg stump, and he misses the flick off his pads. Hits his back leg and rolls away to fine leg Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, 1 leg bye length ball outside off, but cramping Maxwell up. He misses the pull, hits his body and rolls away to the leg side Shadab to Marsh, OUT Big appeal for caught behind by Sarfraz and given Mitch Marsh didn't look too happy, but perhaps that was because he's out - he hasn't reviewed. Classical leg-break, pitching on middle and off and turning away, drawing his bat away from body. Thin edge through and Sarf knew it immediate Hafeez to Carey, OUT Collapse time again? Leading edge, and it flies to the man at extra cover for an easy catch. Tried to work this ball on leg-stump through the leg-side, but closes the face too early. The ball turns enough to take a thick edge. Australia in big trouble Shaheen Shah Afridi to McDermott, OUT direct hit and out! incredible work from Fakhar Zaman at mid-on. The ball was clipped to him, he ran to it, collected it while tumbling forward and flicked it with his left hand to the stumps direct. McDermott was way out of his crease Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, 1 wide just misses his line slightly and it's a wide. Still a victory of sorts for the youngster, because Maxwell wanted to send it over fine leg but missed Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, SIX runs Maxwell connects! Went for the yorker, didn't quite get it. Maxwell went back straight over the bowler's head, full face of the bat and the ball lands beyond the fence Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, OUT is that the match for Pakistan? Maxwell got it off the toe-end and it went miles in the air. Shoaib Malik at long-on kept calm, settled in under it and clutched it to his chest. No chance of the ball popping out. Maxwell's entertaining knock ends. And you'd think so do Au 11.40pm That's it from us for this second T20I. Pakistan were the dominant team, and though Maxwell, and later Coulter-Nile, injected some excitement in the chase, Australia were always playing catch-up. When Pakistan batted, it seemed like they had been a little sluggish, but their bowlers were outstanding. Imad Player of the match is Imad Wasim, PAK","Pakistan 147 for 6 (Babar 45, Hafeez 40, Coulter-Nile 3-18) beat Australia 136 for 8 (Maxwell 52, Shadab 2-30) by 11 runs It will take something truly special to put an end to this purple patch Pakistan are basking in as far as T20I cricket is concerned. As another top-order collapse saw Australia fall short by 11 runs, it became patently obvious this particular visiting side aren't that special someone. Pakistan, again, weren't at their very best with the bat, and it was only a string of medium-sized scores that took them to 147. But it was in the field that their swagger was on full display, with an exceptional bowling performance - and at times an even better fielding one - snuffing out Australia's chances. It was a final result that made the game look closer than it really was."
"7.30pm Australia have won the toss and they are bowling first. They are unchanged from their previous T20I, against UAE. Stanlake to Zaman, 1 leg bye the plan to Fakhar is clear: deny him room and target the body. Short and pings him on the midriff again as Fakhar swings and misses Stanlake to Zaman, OUT Big Billy has bounced out Fakhar. The plan has worked. Banged in short and angling away outside off at 148.4ks - pace like fire - the opener is hurried into a hook against the angle. He skies it to short cover off a top edge Stanlake to Hafeez, 1 leg bye short and skidding in to graze the thigh and roll to the leg side Agar to Hafeez, SIX runs tossed up just a shade outside off, Hafeez dares to step down the track. He does not get close to the pitch but still mows a six over long-on Zampa to Asif Ali, OUT plumb. Length ball, pitched around middle, Asif went back to work it on the leg side, misses and gets rapped on the pads right in front of the stumps Tye to Talat, OUT down the track this time and looks to go over long-on. It was a slower ball which meant Hussain didn't get the required distance and Finch leapt at the long-on to take a good catch Stanlake to Sarfaraz, OUT lbw but reviewed straightaway by Sarfraz. It was a length ball, Sarfraz moved across to work it on the leg side, misses and gets hit just over the knee-roll. There is no bat involved and it's just clipping the leg-stump bail. The original call stays as is it as Pakistan lose their sixth Stanlake to Shadab, OUT short of length and Shadab goes for a pull, but ends up skying it towards fine leg where McDermott settles under it take his second catch of the innings Short to Hafeez, OUT dragged short, Hafeez goes for the pull but ends up mistiming it towards long-on, a bit of top edge too and McDermott takes a comfortable catch Coulter-Nile to Hasan Ali, 1 bye slower bouncer, Hasan has a wild swing but misses, the wicketkeeper fumbles which allows the batsmen to cross for a bye Imad Wasim to Finch, OUT Finch steps away outside leg again, Imad hits the stumps and marks his return to international cricket. The length was short enough for the cut, but the ball drifts back in and finishes on middle. Can't chop it away from there. Finch does not touch it and Imad brings out his CR7 celebrati Imad Wasim to Short, OUT Another wicket for Imad. Another CR7 celebration. Pushed through outside off and angling away from around the wicket, catches Short in the crease. He looks to force it away but loses his shape this time and drags it back onto the stumps via a thick inside edge. What a return for Imad Faheem to Maxwell, OUT What have you done, Maxwell? No show from the Big Show. He jumps away outside leg, exposes all his stumps. Faheem angles a full ball in and pegs back the middle stump as the batsman does not lay bat onto it. Australia three down inside four overs Faheem to McDermott, OUT just short of a good length and outside off, punched up to mid-off. Fakhar swoops down on the ball and under-arms it onto the stumps at the non-striker's end. McDermott chanced the single, dived full length, but is short when the bail is off the groove. Make it four down inside four overs Shaheen Shah Afridi to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye full and fired onto the pads, deflected through square leg Shadab to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye length ball, on the pads, Coulter-Nile was looking to work it fine, misses but gets a leg-bye Shaheen Shah Afridi to Zampa, OUT slower one, Zampa looks to go aerial, gets more height than distance but Hasan Ali almost made a mess of it there. Misjudged it completely at long-on as he came in charging, had to undo his steps in the ends and pedal back, eventually he takes it overhead, tumbling backwards Shadab to Coulter-Nile, OUT googly eventually does the trick. Coulter-Nile cleared his front leg and looked to smashed it hard over long-on, so hard that the bat comes off his hands, he ends up missing the ball and the sound of timber seals the game for Pakistan 11.10pm It was not a big target to chase, but Imad Wasim rocked Australia's innings by removing both openers in the first over of the innings. Faheem Ashraf too got into the act as Australia lost six wickets within the Powerplay. After that, it was just a matter of time. Nathan Coulter-Nile showed some resistance down That's all from our side for this game. We will see you soon. Have a good night. Player of the match is Imad Wasim, PAK","Pakistan 155 for 8 (Babar 68*, Hafeez 39, Stanlake 3-21, Tye 3-24) beat Australia 89 (Coulter-Nile 34, Imad 3-20, Ashraf 2-10) by 66 runs At the trophy unveiling on Tuesday, Aaron Finch and Sarfraz Ahmed stood together, posing for the pre-series picture with the silverware the two teams would fight for. That it was called the TUC Cup for sponsorship reasons was unsurprising in today's age, but when you looked closely, you saw the Cup was rather aptly named. Perched on top of a set of three stumps and a cricket ball was a monstrously large TUC biscuit. That word is used advisedly. The trophy might have looked horrendous if it wasn't comical."
"Tye to Anwar, OUT tried to scoop it over the keeper, missed it completely Tye to Naveed, SIX runs slow ball, hit it straight and high, over the bowler's head, great shot for six runs Coulter-Nile to Ghulam Shabber, 1 wide outside off stumps, big wide Amir Hayat to Finch, OUT short delivery, nicked it high in the air, Shaiman Anwar took an easy catch, Australia lost it's first wicke Australia won by 7 wickets (with 23 balls remaining) Player of the match is D'Arcy Short, AUS","Australia 119 for 3 (Short 68*, Hayat 2-26) beat UAE 117 for 6 (Shaiman 41, Naveed 27*, Coulter-Nile 2-20, Stanlake 2-20) by seven wickets Getty Images A change of format brought about a much-needed change in result for Australia, even though a win in their first-ever T20I against UAE was briefly in doubt in Abu Dhabi. UAE batted first and made 117, and later had Australia 32 for 2 in the sixth over. Then their inexperience showed and Australia took the game away, romping to a seven-wicket win with 23 balls remaining. D'Arcy Short was the chief architect of the chase, finishing 68 not out when the winning runs were hit by debutant Ben McDermott, the 23-year old son of former Australia fast bowler Craig McDermott. A decent workout now sets Australia up for the three-match T20I series against Pakistan starting October 24 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium."
"9.12 pm The Australia bowlers were magnificent in the Powerplay to strangle West Indies' top order and, with the exception of Mitchell Starc, continued through the rest of the innings as well to keep everyone bar Andre Russell in check. 145 feels way below part on this wicket. Hazlewood ends with 3 for 12 in his four overs as the standout bowler while Marsh winds up with 2 for 26. It will take something special from the West Indies in the field to keep Australia from chasing this down. Stay with us for the start of the chase when Andrew McGlashan will be back in the central commentary position. If you're out of breath from that finish, there's very little time to recover before these sides take the field again! They'll be back at it in St Lucia less than 24 hours from now for the second T20I of the five-match series. I'll be back with Andrew McGlashan for the ball-by-ball call. Until then, I'm Peter Della Penna. Take care! Player of the match is Obed McCoy, WI","West Indies 145 for 6 (Russell 51, Hazlewood 3-12, Marsh 2-26) beat Australia 127 (Marsh 51, Wade 33, McCoy 4-26, Walsh 3-23) by 18 runs West Indies fought back to secure an extraordinary victory in the opening match against Australia having been behind the game for large periods. The visitors contrived to lose their last six wickets for 19 runs against Obed McCoy and Hayden Walsh Jr having needed less than five over in the second half of the chase. McCoy, who was impressive in the recent series against South Africa, confounded Australia's lower order with his slower-ball variations while Walsh Jr marked his recalled with the key wicket of top-scorer Mitchell Marsh who looked to have put Australia on track with a maiden T20I fifty. In the end it was another maiden T20I half-century, from Andre Russell, which finished on the winning side as his 51 off 28 balls transformed the West Indies innings after they had laboured against an inspired opening burst from Josh Hazlewood who conceded just three runs in his first three overs. Australia surged out of the blocks in the chase with 70 on the board at the end of the powerplay and the loss of three wickets in the same period seemed a reasonable price to pay to be so far ahead of the required run rate."
"Khaleel Ahmed to Finch, 1 wide swinging a touch down the leg side, he misses the glance, definitely a wide Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT mix-up, direct hit, Lynn's gone. Oooh, this is silly, silly stuff. Stoinis starts it all by dabbing the ball gently towards point and wants a single. Lynn isn't keen on it at first but then just as he commits to it, Stoinis is haring back into his crease, leaving him no choice but to race back to the bowler's end. But Bumrah is on the balll, he takes aim and he throws down the stumps. Super stuff Meanwhile, in the Pro Kabaddi League, pre-tournament favourites Bengal Warriors are in danger of missing out on the playoffs because of their shaky defence. Read more here 8.40pm Here we go. The Australians are about to head out onto the ground. Rohit and Shikhar won't be far behind. Rohit Sharma will face the first ball from Mitchell Starc. Starc to S Dhawan, 1 wide 144kph, swinging wide of off, he flashes and misses but it's called wide by Paul Wilson Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide angled down the leg side and rightly called wide Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs short into the hip and he pulls with the angle up and over fine leg into the crowd! What a shot. Too easy for Sharma Starc to Kohli, 1 leg bye 141 kph, tries to whip a back of a length ball angled into his thighs, but he's into the shot a tiny bit early and the ball lobs off his thigh 10.15 pm This chase was put to bed in the first five overs, with Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan running amok. Australia couldn't hit a single six today, but those two were smoking every other ball out of the ground. But Mitchell Starc, playing his first T20I in two years - his first at home in four - got that first wicket with his searing pace. That strike helped his team-mates settle down and take the game deep. In the end though, as disc That concludes this T20 series. India clearly the better side tonight and probably unlucky with the weather in Melbourne not to win the series 2-1. Now we move on to the Test matches. India play a tour game against the Cricket Australia XI starting on Wednesday at the SCG. The Australian Test squad with the exception of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will play in Shield matches starting on Monday and Tuesday. The first Test India won by 6 wickets (with 2 balls remaining)","India 4 for 168 (Kohli 61*, Dhawan 41) beat Australia 6 for 164 (Short 33, Krunal 4 for 36) by six wickets In front of a record SCG T20I crowd of 37,339 dominated by blue shirts, India levelled the T20I series on the back of a fine performance by their spinners followed by another chasing masterclass from Virat Kohli. A first-wicket stand of 67 in 5.3 overs broke the back of the pursuit before Kohli's unbeaten 61 off 41 balls ensured a couple of India wobbles did not prove terminal. Australia had started promisingly after Aaron Finch decided to bat, but once again the home side struggled against the left-arm wristspin of Kuldeep Yadav who conceded just 19 runs in his four overs. While survival was the main task against Kuldeep, Australia tried to attack Krunal Pandya which presented him with the best figures by a spinner in T20Is in the country."
"5:20pm Virat Kohli and Aaron Finch are ready for the toss. The call is heads and Virat Kohli has won the toss and India will bowl first. Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, SIX runs launches high over midwicket and it goes all the way! Length ball in the slot and Lynn lofts this very high and it falls just over the rope! Khaleel Ahmed to Lynn, SIX runs launched into the upper deck over square leg! Goodness what a strike! This was a shorter length in the arc and it disappeared into the top deck of the stand at square leg. Magnificent hit Kuldeep to Finch, OUT caught at backward point! Brilliant from Kuldeep. He tossed up the wrong un, Finch advances and doesn't get to the pitch, swings hard against the spin, gets a thick outside edge that flies all the way to the man at backward point who takes an easy catch. Great bowling Kuldeep to Lynn, OUT lobs it straight back! Lynn goes too hard at a loopy length ball that goes straight on. He's put in a stride but isn't anywhere near the pitch of that as he tries to get the single at long-off. Soft way to end an innings of hard hitting Khaleel Ahmed to Stoinis, 1 wide short ball rising up to rib height, but it's well down leg side Khaleel Ahmed to Stoinis, 1 wide bouncer dug in too short. Flies high above his right shoulder as he looks to ramp this Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 wide length ball down leg side, past the attempted flick Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT drags it straight to square leg. It's possible he's picked the offcutter here, but it's at such an awkward length that he has no control. Hands a long way out as he goes after this and finds the only fielder in the circle Stanlake to S Dhawan, 1 wide short ball down leg, he hooks and misses, there's a big appeal from Maxwell from point but no one else went up. Called wide. He missed it by miles Behrendorff to S Dhawan, SIX runs flicked over backward square into the crowd! This was into the pads and with the angle he just picked it up and flicked it flat and over backward square and it carried the fence Zampa to Rahul, OUT stumping appeal sent upstairs. KL Rahul is driving inside the line of a googly, well outside off. Away from the body. He has overbalanced and his foot is on the line before the close-ups...and the close-ups reveal no part of the sole is behind the line. Quick hands from Carey after Rahul is done by the loop. Stoinis to Kohli, 1 leg bye into the mid-riff as this skids under his pull shot. Short of a length ball into the side of his stomach and deflects to Carey's right Stanlake to Pant, 1 leg bye slower ball at a length on leg stump, looks to swipe into the leg side, cops it on the thigh Tye to Pant, 1 wide follows him down leg with a bouncer but it's called wide as he beats him Tye to Karthik, 1 wide length and very very wide outside off. Left alone Tye to Pant, OUT taken at point! Pant looks for the reverse scoop and it's the second time in recent memory that he's been out playing that. It was bowled last time, it's a skier for point this time. Third man and two point fielders were in, the shot was on. But he got this full toss off the toe-end. Is there drama left still?! Stoinis to Karthik, OUT finds long-off! There is life in this Australian bowling still. Stoinis sticks to his strategy of slower ones despite the caning last over. Drops it short of length outside off, gives him no pace as he walks down and all he can do is slap it, flat, straight to Behdrendorff. Dinesh KArthik won't take India home today, but he's broug 10:20pm That is all from our coverage today. An exciting game, accentuated by superb middle-order batting, made interesting by mini-capitaulations by the fielding teams, and given an entire new dimension by the rain, that had most of us all over the place. We hope you enjoyed the coverage. On behalf of Alex and Raghav, this is goodbye. Player of the match is Adam Zampa, AUS","Australia 4 for 158 (Maxwell 46, Kuldeep 2-24) beat India 7 for 169 (Dhawan 76, Zampa 2-22) by four runs on DLS method 1:39 We had to target all the bowlers - Dhawan Australia overcame India and their own considerable self-doubts to claim a white-knuckle Twenty20 encounter at the Gabba, having granted India a late sight of victory in a rain shortened affair. Marcus Stoinis successfully defended 13 off the final over, after at one point India had required 70 from 32 balls. Chris Lynn and Aaron Finch, the captain, had given Australia a fair platform, but it was Glenn Maxwell and Stoinis who provided the heft to an innings reduced by three overs due to a rain delay of more than an hour. Kuldeep Yadav bowled artfully for India, though his spin partner Krunal Pandya was taken for 55 damaging runs. Shikhar Dhawan kept India in touch for the bulk of their pursuit, while the hosts fared far better against Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli - they managed just 24 off 28 balls between them."
"Coulter-Nile to Hendricks, SIX runs miles into the stands as he pulls this from back of a length over deep midwicket Coulter-Nile to Hendricks, OUT and then the short ball works! Properly banged in this time, climbs a tough more on Hendricks, takes more top edge than middle out to deep square Maxwell to de Kock, OUT flatter, slides under the bottom edge as de Kock comes down the pitch, and offers a simple stumping for Carey Stanlake to du Plessis, OUT a brilliant parried boundary catch by Maxwell, we see them pretty often these days but they are still fantastic. This was pulled towards deep midwicket, Maxwell took it just inside the rope and had terrific awareness of where he was, flicks it in the air, jumps over the boundary then back inside to regather the catch Coulter-Nile to Klaasen, OUT a length ball outside off, tries to clear long-on but doesn't connect well enough and finds the man Coulter-Nile to Miller, 1 leg bye big appeal for lbw as he swings across the line, deflects off the back to short third man. That looked a pretty good shout Tye to Miller, OUT carves a wide full toss straight to deep cover, Australia finishing well so far. Miller gave himself a bit of room and ended up having to reach a long way for it Tye to Morris, OUT full outside off, big swing, thin edge, comfortable catch...the big build-up for Morris and he bags a golden Ngidi to Finch, 1 leg bye short of a length, into the pads, drops down by his feet and Lynn calls him through Ngidi to Maxwell, SIX runs that's sweetly struck, stands much stiller, it's a length delivery and it's lofted well over long-on Player of the match is Tabraiz Shamsi, SA","South Africa 6 for 108 (du Plessis 27, de Kock 22, Tye 2-18) beat Australia 7 for 87 (Maxwell 38, Morris 2-12) by 21 runs A torrential downpour on the Gold Coast dampened the mood before South Africa inflicted Australia's third loss in four matches to leave the home side down right miserable. Australia have now lost their last four T20Is and five of the last six on top of losing a one-day and Test series in between times. The rain reduced the game to a 10 overs-a-side on a surface at Metricon Stadium that was hosting international cricket for the first time. South Africa coped with the unknowns of the conditions and the pitch better than their opponents, piling on 108 in 10 overs thanks to a power-packed Powerplay from Quinton de Kock and Reeza Hendricks. Australia's chase drowned under the scoreboard pressure."
"Starc to Markram, OUT strangled down the leg side again! Unbelievable! This was a horrible delivery way down leg, a half-volley, he tried to flick it away and got a little tickle off the face and Carey takes another catch behind moving down the leg side. Hazlewood to Miller, OUT caught at deep midwicket! The carnage ends! It was a full toss in the hitting arc to go out of the park, he nailed it flat to deep midwicket, Finch caught it right on the rope, he tossed it up as he overbalanced, stepped outside the rope and the back in to complete a good catch. Rabada to Marsh, 1 wide 125kph, pushed with the angle down the leg side Steyn to Carey, SIX runs another one into the crowd as Steyn drops short, terrific pick up by Carey as he swivels on a pull Pretorius to Marsh, OUT taken at deep midwicket! Marsh can't beyond his ton. Massive, massive moment. That came down with snow on it. A short-of-a-length delivery, Marsh was aiming to clear the leg side again but could only send it high into the night sky. Klaasen had an age to think about the catch as it came, but held on securely Rabada to Maxwell, 1 wide follows him with a short ball as he moves to the leg side, it's too short Rabada to Hazlewood, 1 wide a short ball outside leg stump, goes over his back and it's called wide...a few smiles around Player of the match is David Miller, SA","South Africa 5 for 320 (Miller 139, du Plessis 125) beat Australia 9 for 280 (Marsh 106, Stoinis 63, Rabada 3-40, Steyn 3-45) by 40 runs Captain Faf du Plessis joined the powerful David Miller for the biggest partnership in ODIs between South Africa and Australia to clinch the series in a high-scoring affair at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The duo took the visitors comfortably out of reach of a doughty chasing effort by Shaun Marsh, who struck his sixth ODI century. Having lost three early wickets after being sent in by Aaron Finch, du Plessis and Miller provided a model exhibition of how to build a dominant position from modest beginnings, getting well established through steady accumulation before accelerating in brutal fashion in the closing overs of the innings. Their stand of 252 surpassed a union of 222 between Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan, at Docklands in 2000, as the biggest ever stand in Australia v South Africa ODIs. Both batsmen gathered momentum but offered contrasting styles and preferred scoring areas to give the Australian bowlers no end of headaches."
"Ngidi to Finch, 2 leg byes angled into the pad, clipped through square leg...actually no bat involved Rabada to Marsh, OUT big edge, caught behind! Just as it as looking good for Australia, Marsh goes for a drive on the up, the delivery was back of a length, and gets a thick top edge. Hint of movement off the seam as well Pretorius to Finch, OUT dragged on, big strike. Too close for the shot, perhaps? Back of a length outside off, looking to angle it into the off side, takes a bottom edge into off stump. A bit of a cutter, too, so credit to Pretorius Rabada to Lynn, OUT caught behind, and is that a bit of a send-off from Rabada?! What action in this over. Another bouncer, shorter this time, angling over leg stump, Lynn went for the hook and it takes a glove. Perhaps a word from Rabada to Lynn. Good take from de Kock. Rabada to Maxwell, 1 leg bye back of a length, takes an inside edge off the pad behind square on the leg side Pretorius to Stoinis, OUT caught at midwicket! This is a howling shot! From a length on off, out of nowhere he tried to launch this over mid on, dragged it off the inside half of the bat to midwicket and Hendricks held on to a superb catch above his head! It flew sharply and he clung on with one hand. Steyn to Cummins, OUT Bowled him at 145kph! Just a missile targeting off stump, it was cross seam, Cummins was a week late as it skidded through under the probing bat and crashed into off stump! Simply too quick from Steyn Steyn to Starc, OUT caught and bowled! Back of a length, he was cramped for room trying to turn this around behind square, closed the face too soon, got a leading edge and it lobbed up in the air straight back to the bowler who gleefully to an easy catch Rabada to Zampa, OUT caught at midwicket! What a bizarre dismissal. It was a short ball at the body, he backed away and it followed him, he played a swat, tennis smash type shot and popped it straight up to midwicket. Easy catch for Miller. Four wickets for Rabada and Australia ar bowled out with nine balls remaining. Starc to de Kock, OUT picks out long leg! Starc strikes early, probably not how he planned. It's a length ball shaping into de Kock, he whipped it with his strong wrists, but never tried to keep it down and Zampa judged the catch well. Didn't go in entirely cleanly, but held on. Picked out the one man in the deep, a bit careless really Starc to Markram, SIX runs take that! That's one way to deal with Starc thunderbolts, this is fuller outside off, Markram picks it up off the front foot and deposits it over deep midwicket. Astonishing shot Starc to Miller, 1 wide that's a wayward one, pushed well down the leg side Starc to Miller, 1 wide 150kph but sprayed down the legside Stoinis to du Plessis, 1 wide 125kph, pushed down the leg side Hazlewood to Miller, 1 wide 146kph, short down the leg side, he ducks and it's called a wide, Hazlewood not happy Cummins to du Plessis, 1 wide pushed way down leg again, another extra Cummins to du Plessis, OUT chopped on! There's the breakthrough! This was back of a length and well wide, du Plessis threw the hands at it from the crease with an angled back, got a thick inside edge and dragged it back onto the stumps! A touch unlucky for the South Africa captain but Australia will take it Stoinis to Miller, SIX runs advances and launches over mid on! This was great batting. He shuffled down the track, no one back on the rope, he lofted the length ball up and over and it carried all the way Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 231 (Carey 47, Lynn 44, Rabada 4-54, Pretorius 3-32) beat South Africa 9 for 224 (Miller 51, du Plessis 47, Stoinis 3-35) Australia secured a cathartic, series-levelling victory in the second ODI against South Africa in Adelaide, holding the visitors to 9 for 224 to win by seven runs. The bowling attacks slugged it out as batsmen on either side struggled to build on their starts, with four men reaching the 40s but none able to play the decisive innings. Australia were bowled out an over and a half shy of their 50 overs for 231, and South Africa fell short despite David Miller's fifty. Cross-seamed deliveries and cutters brought the most profit for bowlers on both sides, Dwaine Pretorius picking up 3 for 32 in the afternoon and Marcus Stoinis making several crucial breakthroughs for a return of 3 for 35 that turned the match decisively. Kagiso Rabada's extra bounce brought him 4 for 54, with three of those dismissals being caught behind, but South Africa's efforts with the ball were ultimately bettered by Australia's to keep the series alive heading into the third match in Hobart on Sunday."
"10.15am Drama is not usually far away when these sides meet, of all variety! Here are five of the best contests between Australia and South Africa drawn up by Liam Brickhill. 10.40am Ten minutes until the toss. We know that Marsh is out and Short is in. What will the balance of Australia's attack be? The fast bowling of both sides should be a feature of this series: Starc, Cummins, Hazlewood, Steyn, Rabada, Ngidi. Tasty. The Australia selectors, Justin Langer and Greg Chappell, were understood to be set to pick Zampa and leave Cummins out. But the expected pace and bounce in the wicket changed their minds. Aaron Finch said at the toss they liked the way D'Arcy Short bowled in the T20 series in the UAE and they were comfortable to rely on his left-arm wrist spin as the al 11.10am The players are coming out for the anthems. 11.18am We're almost ready for the first ball. Travis Head and Aaron Finch are out there. Head will face the first ball from Dale Steyn. Two slips in. Steyn to Head, OUT edged and caught behind! This was almost a half-volley, across the left-hander, Head's feet were stuck in cement on the crease as threw the hands at a drive and got a thin edge through to de Kock and he gleefully accepts the simple catch. Great start for the great Dale Steyn. Steyn to Short, OUT edged and what a catch by du Plessis at second slip! Another full ball across the left hander, he launches into a drive, again not a big forward stride, thick edge, flies high to the skipper's left and he jumps and takes a superb catch flying up with two hands above his left shoulder! Great bowling and catching from South Africa Ngidi to Finch, OUT LBW! Finch walks off. No review! This was a good length wide of off, nipped back sharply and hits above the knee roll, and Aleem Dar gives it! He was on his toes on the crease. There is a lot of bounce in this track. Hawkeye had it going over the stumps! How did they not review that! There has been a lot of pace and bounce. That Ngidi to Lynn, 1 bye this cuts him half! 135kph! This nipped off the seam, back between bat and body, it knifed him in half, de Kock was horizontal to his left but couldn't glove it cleanly Phehlukwayo to Lynn, OUT another one goes! Appeal for caught behind, given not out and South Africa review straightaway. It sounded like a bottom edge. A delivery with some width, Lynn went after it, and there's a clear noise as the ball passes the bat. There's also a spike on Snicko. Lynn is almost off the field...he's basically walked! Umpire sa Phehlukwayo to Maxwell, OUT caught at mid-on! It goes from bad to worse for Australia, although Maxwell is standing his ground to see if it's carried. He came forward into a drive, a bit early on it, couldn't keep the ball down. It's dripping on the way Klaasen. Soft signal was out, and third umpire says he's happy the fingers are under the ball Ngidi to Carey, 1 leg bye round the wicket, short of a length, still some seam movement as this comes off the thigh pad towards gully Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, 1 wide angled down the leg side, another wide Phehlukwayo to Stoinis, OUT oh dear! What was that?! Stoinis has just clubbed it to mid-on. A length ball, he tried to drive through the line, didn't even look as though he was trying to keep it down. Simple catch Rabada to Carey, OUT direct hit from cover! David Miller on target, an underarm flick with his right hand. Cummins is struggling. Was dropped into the off side by Carey, Cummins was slow out of the blocks and he's well short. There has been some wonderful bowling today, but Australia also not helping themselves Tahir to Carey, OUT another sweep, and he's gone. He couldn't stop himself sweeping and paddling. Was trying to almost scoop this right over the keeper. Takes a little top edge, into the arm, and lobs up the air. De Kock takes a simple catch. Poor game management from Carey? Tahir to Starc, OUT Given LBW! Starc reviews. This was pushed through flatter, out of the front of the hand and it skids on, he was right back in his crease and struck on the knee roll. Nothing on hot spot. Nothing on snicko. He missed it. Hawkeye has it pitching in line and hitting. Out! Good decision. Ngidi to Coulter-Nile, OUT Skied pull shot and Klaasen sits under it and takes it easily at mid on! The end for Australia. It was short and wide of off, but he tried to pull over midwicket, got it off the toe end of the bat, it flew very high, Klaasen camped under it and took an easy catch Alex Carey says he never felt in on the wicket. He said the wicket had plenty of bounce and the ball stayed new for a long time. The openers are out there. Josh Hazlewood will open the bowling to Quinton de Kock. South Africa have 20 minutes to bat Starc to Hendricks, 1 bye plays over the top of a very full delivery outside off, bursts through Carey's gloves Coulter-Nile to Hendricks, 1 leg bye takes another blow from a short one as he isn't able to sway out of the line, comes off his arm, I think, and deflects past slip 5.37pm That was clinical from South Africa. They take a 1-0 lead in the three match series. They razed the Australian top order via a stunning spell from Dale Steyn and then great follow up work from Ngidi, Rabada and Phehlukwayo. Then de Kock, Hendricks and Markram made pretty light work of the chase. Marcus Stoinis nabbed three wickets but there wasn't 5.45pm It's Gnasher back with you to close things out for today. Hopefully we'll hear from the two captains. If you want some more live cricket, the Bangladesh-Zimbabwe Test is currently going on South Africa won by 6 wickets (with 124 balls remaining) Player of the match is Dale Steyn, SA","South Africa 4 for 153 (de Kock 47, Hendricks 44) beat Australia 152 (Phehlukwayo 3-33) by six wickets Elite honesty, meet elite performance. Australia's home summer without their best two batsmen began in sickening style for the hosts, shot out for 152 by South Africa's high quality pace attack and consigned to a six-wicket hiding on a fast and fiery Perth Stadium pitch in front of a disappointing crowd. Where 53,781 had been present at the new venue for a January ODI against England, only a fraction of that assembly were in attendance as the side captained by Aaron Finch were sent in to bat after Faf du Plessis won a more than useful toss. They were to be witness to Australia's lowest total in a home ODI against South Africa for 21 years, since cobbling 125 at the MCG in 1997. A target of 153 was to prove a simple task for South Africa, guided with some panache by Quinton de Kock with the assistance of Reeza Hendricks."
"Welcome back for the final part of this series. Which team is taking the prize? Guptill and Conway to open... Zampa to Phillips, SIX runs clubbed over long-on for the series win! Lovely little cameo from Phillips here, came out looking to hit boundaries and nailed it. This is tossed up and once again he clears the front leg to make room and goes against the turn with a lofted drive 2:59pm Hugs and handshakes all around as New Zealand overcome the hiccups in their last two games to take this series convincingly. The bowling delivered as a whole today for them, Ish Sodhi once again among the wickets and doing most of the damage. Economical stuff from the rest of the bowlers too before the brand new opening stand of Guptill and Conway delivered. They had impetus at the start, which turned into confident stroke-making and eventually into a 3:13pm New Zealand pose with the trophy, and that is all from our live coverage tonight. Thanks for joining us through the series. We shall see you soon. On behalf of Gnasher and Ranjith, this is goodbye. New Zealand won by 7 wickets (with 27 balls remaining) Player of the match is Martin Guptill, NZ","New Zealand 143 for 3 (Guptill 71, Conway 36, Phillips 34*, Meredith 2-39) beat Australia 142 for 8 (Wade 44, Finch 36, Sodhi 3-24, Boult 2-26) by 7 wickets A dreadful finish to Australia's innings opened the way for New Zealand to rumble to a seven-wicket victory and a 3-2 T20I series triumph, as Martin Guptill and Devon Conway finished the bout the way they had started it in Christchurch. A pair of wins in spectator-free games had allowed Australia to turn up for the final game with a chance to win from 0-2 down, but on a sunny Sunday afternoon with a crowd again present, Kane Williamson's side scotched early momentum enjoyed by the visitors when Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch were in harness to completely dominate the closing overs and leave a target of just 143 to win. Ish Sodhi, Mitchell Santner and Trent Boult all made valuable contributions. Guptill and Conway, joining forces as openers, then powered to a stand worth 101 to mean that a rapid second spell from Riley Meredith was nowhere near enough to prevent the match and series going comfortably New Zealand's way. Having been eliminated from the World Test Championship final by India's victory over England the night before, it has not been a happy 24 hours for the Australians."
"Faulkner to Guptill, 1 leg bye angles it into the pads and Guptill is unable to do what he wants to, tickle it past the left of short fine leg, which would have been a boundary Stoinis to Broom, 1 leg bye waddles across off and deflects a ball ball square on the leg side Stoinis to Guptill, OUT bowled'em. Stoinis has nabbed both Williamson and Guptill. Sneaks through the gate. Half-volley length, bowled from wide of the crease, right up there to be laced through the covers. Guptill attempts a drive, but the ball cuts back in slightly and goes through the defences. Hits middle and leg stumps with the offcutter Hazlewood to Neesham, OUT top edge as he pulls and deep midwicket takes a simple catch. Excellent time for a wicket and it comes from their Mr Dependable. Simple, back of a length, not much room to free the arms. Neesham tries to make a bit too much of it and mistimes his shot. Head steadies himself a few yards inside the fence and takes it well Starc to Broom, 1 wide spears a 145 kph delivery down the leg side, Broom tries to get his bat on it with a flick but he has no chance Cummins to Southee, OUT backs away and goes for the upper cut and he hasn't got enough on it. Third man comes up off the boundary, steadies himself and takes a good catch. Faulkner the man there Starc to Broom, 1 wide full and quite a distance outside off, Broom can collect the extra Faulkner to Broom, OUT comes down the track and hoists a back of the hand slower ball on leg stump to long-on. End of a fine innings from Broom, who has basically had to fight all on his lonesome all through the middle overs Cummins to Boult, SIX runs these two were there two years ago, but it was Williamson who hit Cummins for six to win the game. Here Boult gets his piece, backing away and carving the bouncer over the third man boundary Australia wouldn't entirely be fazed by this target, they've got power-hitters aplenty, but with a couple of new faces in their middle order and their captain for the tour Matthew Wade out injured, you just can't be sure. Not much should sour the mood of Marcus Stoinis though, he picked up Kane Williamson as his first ODI wicket, followed it up by removing Martin Guptill for 61 and eventually finished with 10-0-49-3. Join us in about half an hour for the resumption. Southee to Handscomb, OUT there's a clicking sound as the stand-in keeper Latham gloves the ball. Umpire Knight shakes his head. NZ challenge the on-field not-out decision. Cross-seamer from Southee. Handsomb simply prods at it away from the body, and nicks it behind. Hotspot detects a white blotch and nicko detects a spike as the ball passes the bat. Handscomb has to go. Umpire Knight reverses his call, raises his finger, and sends back Handscomb Munro to Faulkner, 1 wide another leg-side wide Neesham to Stoinis, SIX runs length ball outside off, Stoinis backs away outside leg and clobbers it over cover. Picked the offcutter and hit the pants off it Neesham to Stoinis, 1 wide slower bouncer, too high. Wide called Southee to Stoinis, SIX runs low full-toss outside off, smeared over long-off for a six. Fifty partnership with no contribution at all from Hazlewood. He hasn't faced a ball yet. Unbelievable scenes at Eden Park 7.15pm Stoinis arrived at 54 for 5 and did not budge at all. He picked off the gaps with Faulkner, picked off the short straight boundaries with the tail, and powered onto follow an uninterrupted spell of 10-0-49-3 with a sterling century. He even added a fifty stand with No.11 Josh Hazlewood with the latter not facing a ball in about 30 minutes. During the process, Stoinis became the first Australian to hit a century and claim three wickets in an ODI. At the end of another Player of the match is Marcus Stoinis, AUS","New Zealand 286 for 9 (Broom 73, Guptill 61, Stoinis 3-49) beat Australia 280 (Stoinis 146*, Santner 3-44) by six runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kane Williamson held his nerve, ran the last man out with a direct hit and stopped Marcus Stoinis seven runs short of pulling off the most miraculous of Australian chases in an Eden Park ODI. Stoinis' unbeaten 146 turned a comfortable New Zealand victory into an utterly thrilling encounter. And yet he was only on the tour because the first-choice allrounder Mitchell Marsh was resting a shoulder problem. Stoinis joined a motley assortment of other second-choice players standing in for the captain Steven Smith, his deputy David Warner and the wicketkeeper Matthew Wade among others, but the innings he conjured was among the finest played for Australia in recent memory, showing equal parts composure and brutality. Stoinis was the first from his country to wallop a century and pick up three or more wickets in the same match."
"Hafeez to Warner, SIX runs down the track now, makes a bit of room, and that's a super shot. Got himself into the perfect position, put himself at the perfect distance from the pitch of the ball to be able to extend his arms fully and get the elevation to launch that over wide long-off Wahab Riaz to Head, 4 leg byes looks to go full now, possibly looking for the yorker, ends up slanting it down the leg side and Head misses the flick but gets a little tickle on it with his pad to beat the wicketkeeper diving to his right Hasan Ali to Warner, SIX runs there it is! Slower short ball on middle, Warner waits for the ball to arrive. Then launches it into the stands beyond midwicket with a pull. This is now Australia's highest stand for any wicket in ODIs Junaid to Warner, OUT carved away in the air. It dies in front of point, but Azam bends forward and snaps up a low catch. He claims it, and they go upstairs. It's a clean catch and a cramping David Warner walks back for 179, his best ODI score. No double-hundred for him, though. Slower short ball, cuts away from Warner. He reaches out for the ball and scythes it in the air. The opening stand ends Amir to Head, 1 wide Head backs away outside leg, this is a head-high bouncer outside off. Head jumps off the ground but the ball sails over him. Wide called Amir to Head, SIX runs Head pre-meditates outside leg, Amir chases the batsman with a 142ks short ball.Head smites a six over midwicket Amir to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell hits it flat and hard to Hafeez at sweeper cover. Full and outside off, Maxwell simply shovels it in the air with the bottom hand to the man in the deep. Dolly catch Hasan Ali to Wade, OUT slower ball from Hasan. Full and cuts away from the left-hander. Wade aims to loft it, possibly down the ground. Ends up slicing a catch to sweeper cover Hasan Ali to Head, SIX runs Head puts Hasan in the stands beyond midwicket. Length ball outside off, another slower one, drops down to one knee and smites a slog-sweep Hasan Ali to Head, OUT Juggles and takes it on the third attempt. Azhar has a wry smile. Head walks back for 128, acknowledging the applause at his home ground. Full and angling away outside off, Head eyes a leg-side slog, ends up skying an overhead catch to long-off. Azhar hangs onto it.... just Hasan Ali to Faulkner, 1 wide very full and wide outside off, on the tramline or just inside, wide called. Faulkner can't carve it away Starc to Azhar Ali, OUT gone! Full, swinging in, and it's so hard to drag your front leg away from those. He's forced to play across it, misses it by a long way, and he doesn't bother reviewing. I'd like to see ball-tracking anyway - seemed like there was just a bit of a chance it may have swung down the leg side. Nope. Hitting the middle of leg stump, it says Hazlewood to Babar Azam, 1 wide full, down the leg side. Can't connect with the flick Zampa to Sharjeel, 2 wide fired down the leg side, the ball bobbles out of Wade's gloves, and they sneak across Zampa to Sharjeel, SIX runs Zampa throws it up outside off, Sharjeel takes it on. He opens up his shoulders, swings it mightily across the line and dumps Zampa over the wide long-on fence Cummins to Babar Azam, 1 wide short and down leg, ducks under it. Wide called Hazlewood to Umar Akmal, 1 wide short, very wide outside off. Akmal reaches out to cut but can't connect Hazlewood to Rizwan, 1 wide full, angling down leg. Rizwan can't connect with the flick Cummins to Rizwan, OUT short outside off, and that's timed too well for Rizwan's liking. Goes for the slash, ends up slicing under the ball, and does it carry to Starc diving forward from third man? He himself isn't sure. They're checking upstairs now... Soft signal is out. Looks like he's taken it cleanly. Yup, out, and is that it for Pakistan? Cummins to Wahab Riaz, 1 leg bye full, angling down leg. Can't connect with the flick and the ball hits him on the pad 10.20pm Phew. That's it from us, after a looong day at the Adelaide Oval. A triumphant end to the summer for Australia after a rocky beginning against South Africa. Hope you've enjoyed our coverage of the series, and you can pop over to the India-England T20 ball-by-ball if you so wish. Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 7 for 369 (Warner 179, Head 128) beat Pakistan 312 (Azam 100, Sharjeel 79, Starc 4-42) by 57 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details What a way to celebrate Australia Day. David Warner and Travis Head gave the Adelaide Oval crowd special reason to enjoy the national holiday by rewriting the record books and compiling the all-time highest ODI partnership for Australia, a 284-run stand that set up a hefty win over Pakistan in the final match of the series. For a dead rubber, this game had plenty of bounce - at least, while Australia were batting. Their 7 for 369 meant Pakistan would have required the third-highest successful chase in ODI history if they were to emerge with a consolation win; it was simply too big a task, despite a century from Babar Azam and a typically entertaining 79 from Sharjeel Khan. Although Pakistan managed their highest total of the series - 312 - they still suffered a 57-run defeat, and will fly home with a 1-4 ODI series loss to sit alongside their 0-3 result in the Tests."
"Hasan Ali to Warner, (no ball) front-foot n-ball. Full on middle and leg, clipped to midwicket Hasan Ali to Khawaja, OUT Khawaja nicks behind, Rizwan dives across to his left and grasps the edge. 44 boundary-less balls, including the front-foot no-ball, and Pakistan find the breakthrough. Full and slanting away from off stump, Khawaja's front foot is nowhere close to the pitch of this delivery. He simply throws his bat at a bi Hasan Ali to Smith, OUT he's got him! Good length outside off, tails in, he walks across and is trapped in front. Smith reviews. No bat involved. That's out. Hits him in line and it would've crashed into middle and leg. What an over from Hasan Ali. Junaid to Head, SIX runs length ball outside off, Head parcels it up and dispatches it several rows beyond the midwicket boundary. Smeared off the middle of the bat. Raises the 300 for Australia Amir to Head, SIX runs Head brings up the century stand and his fifty with one blow: smear over midwicket. Uses his feet, meets a short ball, and dumps it over the leg-side boundary Amir to Head, OUT Phew, Pakistan finally hang onto a catch (yes, you read that right). Head pre-meditates, ventures a long way outside leg. He is chased by a short ball, which gets big. Attempts a hook and skies a top-edge to Malik at deep square leg Hasan Ali to Wade, OUT Skied to long-on. Chest-high catch, Imad Wasim clings onto it.... just It nearly popped out at the last moment. Pitched up and outside off, right in the hitting slot. Wade lofts and miscues it to Imad. Fourth wicket for Hasan Hasan Ali to Maxwell, OUT Sharjeel hangs onto a dolly, and Hasan does the sajdah, celebrating his maiden five-for. His figures of 5 for 52 stand out amid this carnage. Very full and outside off, Maxwell flits around in the crease and shovel-whips it in the air. Sharjeel takes it at deep square leg. He did not even have to budge Hello, again.The returning Starc takes the new ball for Australia. Over the wicket. Azhar and Sharjeel are Pakistan's openers. Two slips in place Zampa to Sharjeel, 1 wide leg-side wide Zampa to Sharjeel, OUT Sharjeel can't clear the long boundary, Warner snaps it up at the edge of the deep midwicket boundary. He lets out a big roar. Tossed up outside off, not much turn. Sharjeel goes down on one knee. Toe-ends a slog sweep. First wicket for Zampa, and that's a major blow for Pakistan Zampa to Hafeez, SIX runs got plenty on this! Clean hit. Floated on a good length at middle, gets a knee down and hits a fluent slog sweep to clear the deep fielder Starc to Umar Akmal, 1 wide slower bouncer on middle stump, bursts off the surface, sails over the attempted hook. Wide called. Too high Starc to Umar Akmal, 1 wide Umar shimmies out and puts Starc off. Slides a full ball down the leg side Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT Pat Cummins calmly settles under the skier. Two wickets in two overs right after drinks. Starc digs it short and outside off. Slower bouncer. Umar has a limp pull at it, plays way early, and top-edges it into the hands of Cummins at short fine leg. Umar never really got going Starc to Imad Wasim, 1 leg bye back of a length and on the leg stump, misses the flick, grazes the pad and rolls to square leg Zampa to Rizwan, OUT quick skidder from Zampa, fizzes in with the arm, beats the inside edge as Rizwan plays across the line and is pinged on the front pad above the knee-roll. The finger goes up. Nothing on Hotspot. Nothing on RTS. The tracker shows it would carry onto hit the top of leg stump. Umpire Gaffney's on-field call is vind Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 6 for 353 (Warner 130, Maxwell 78, Head 51, Hasan 5-52) beat Pakistan 267 (Sharjeel 74, Hazlewood 3-54, Zampa 3-55) by 86 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A David Warner hundred. A catalogue of Pakistan fielding errors. A big win for Australia. It was as if the fourth one-day international in Sydney was a recap of the Test campaign earlier this summer. Certainly the result was the same - a series victory for Australia."
"Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 wide way over the batsman's head, too short from Cummins outside off. This time it's called wide. Wade was airborne when he collected that Cummins to Sharjeel, 1 wide too short, another wide. Looking to test the bounce of the surface, is he? This was way down leg side and the correct call Head to Sharjeel, OUT the party is over! Sharjeel looks to cut again, this time it was too close for him to play that. The drift in ensured he only managed a thick inside edge back onto the stumps. Celebration one delivery, frustration the next. Head to Shafiq, OUT GONE! Grade cricket batting that. Head loops it across him outside off, he steps out early, gets beaten in flight and doesn't know what to do with it next. Flails at it as it keeps drifting away and he can only get a top-edge, straight to short third man Head to Malik, SIX runs WOW! You can keep looking at that on loop. Floated on off stump, he steps out and lifts it majestically over the bowler's head and whacks the sightscreen - which is a 103 metres behind. Gorgeous. Faulkner to Babar Azam, 2 leg byes CLOSE! Almost picked up my first commentary wicket. Walks across his stumps to this good length delivery, and catches it on his pads as he tries to flick it. Pitched outside leg though but trapped him right in front Stanlake to Babar Azam, 1 wide 134 kph, bouncer on middle stump and it flies well over the ducking batsman Stanlake to Malik, OUT GONE! 134 kph, good length in the corridor, and his poor feet movement have finally done him. Pushes at it with hard hands and gets a healthy outside edge. Wade takes it easily and that's Stanlake's first wicket in ODIs Okay the batsmen are out and this is interesting. Sharjeel has brought out the helmet and is at short leg. Hafeez is opening the bowling. Hafeez to Smith, SIX runs effortlessly launched over long-off. Steps out, get to the pitch and lofts him cleanly over the ropes. Opened the bat face deliberately to play it there. Super stuff Hasan Ali to Smith, 1 bye good slower ball. 119 kph, good length outside off. Smith wants to whip this through midwicket but he's into it too early and it slides between bat and pad Like Mohammad Hafeez said, the platform was there to get 300, but Australia came back nicely into this game. You don't give a man like Handscomb chances with the form he's in - he capitalized fully and overcame a nervy start to post a nice 82 on debut. Australia won by 7 wickets (with 30 balls remaining) Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 3 for 265 (Smith 108*, Handscomb 82) beat Pakistan 7 for 263 (Azam 84, Sharjeel 50, Hazlewood 3-32) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details ""We've traditionally chased pretty well here at the WACA,"" Steven Smith said after sending Pakistan in to bat. Perhaps what he meant was that he chases pretty well at the WACA. Last summer, Smith plundered 149 as Australia hunted down a target of 310 against India, winning in the last over. This time it was easier - Australia passed Pakistan's 263 with five overs left - but again a Smith hundred got them there. Smith finished unbeaten on 108, his eighth ODI century, as Australia took a 2-1 lead in the series."
"Hasan Ali to Head, OUT and the bowler has the last laugh. Hasan Ali celebrates with a jump and a pump of the fists. Follows up the short ball with a fuller delivery outside off, forcing Head to go after it and try to drive through covers. The batsman falls for the trap and gets a healthy edge for his troubles. Rizwan catches it without fuss behind the stumps Hafeez to Maxwell, SIX runs shot. Springs down the track. The ball is flighted just enough for him to get right on top of that and loft it clean and powerfully over deep midwicket. Clears the boundary by a distance Imad Wasim to Smith, 1 wide fired down the leg side, Smith cannot make contact on the attempted glance and the wicketkeeper collects it well as he anticipates early and moves to his left Imad Wasim to Maxwell, OUT knocked him over. Quicker ball from Wsim and Maxwell charges down the track and the bat hits the pad as he tris to force it through the off-side. Does not make contact with the ball as a result and it goes through to take out the stumps Imad Wasim to Smith, 5 wide fired down the leg side, Smith gets down and tries to scoop it but the ball drifts down leg and he cannot make contact. The wicketkeeper also cannot get his hands to it as it is bowled at a poor line Imad Wasim to Smith, OUT good length ball that is delivered at a slower pace and Smith is through with the shot early. Gets an inside edge as he comes forward looking to force it through the off side and the ball crashes into the stumps. Done in by the lack of pace Imad Wasim to Faulkner, 1 leg bye down the leg side, tries to flick it but the ball brushes the pad and goes away behind the stumps Malik to Wade, OUT goes through the gate. Wade's troubled stay against spin comes to an end. Played all around it. Attacking line and on the stumps. Wade pushes forward awkwardly, leaves a big gap between bat and pad and the ball sneaks through that gap to take out middle stump Junaid to Starc, OUT slower full ball and some good fielding by Junaid. He is having a dream comeback game. It was full and Starc was trying to clip it away but inside-edges it to the pad and the ball just rolls away. He looks for a non-existent single and it does not help that Faulkner is a tad unresponsive. Sent back late and Junaid picks it up and nails a direct hit Amir to Cummins, OUT short ball, tries to hook and gets a top-edge as the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Probably got a glove again and it's a very feeble edge. This time, Cummins walks. Does not bother looking at the umpire as he walks away even as the wicketkeeper starts appealing Amir to Faulkner, OUT held at point and that's the end of the innings with four balls remaining. It was a short of good length ball but he is in no position to slap it. Skews it in the air to point where Shafiq settles under it easily Excellent bowling effort from Pakistan. All credit to Junaid for setting the tone early with a superb opening spell. Credit to Mohammad Hafeez also for some good captaincy and field placements. He gave both Junaid and Amir an extended opening spell. Junaid only bowled in the high 120s for the most part but got the ball to swing prodigiously early. Once early wickets fell, it set up the platform 6.30pm Thanks Akshay. Pakistan may not get a better chance for a win in this series. They've bowled exceptionally well, couldn't have done too much better. On a slow surface, changes in pace will decide the speed of the game. Australia were forced to make their own pace, and struggled. Pakistan's strength has almost always been their bowling, though. Hafeez and Sharjeel are out there. Starc wit Hazlewood to Hafeez, 1 wide on a length outside off, too wide. Called Starc to Hafeez, 1 wide full and way too wide, 148 kph, another leave Faulkner to Sharjeel, OUT taken this time! And Australia get Sharjeel. A length delivery outside off, fourth-stump channel. Sharjeel lets the ball come to him, looking for one down to third man off the open face but the ball kisses the outside edge and is easily held by Wade. Sharjeel looking for something too cheeky, that's not his strength. Faulkner to Babar Azam, 1 leg bye on the hips, Azam misses a nudge, struck on the pad and a deflection to fine leg ensues Starc to Babar Azam, OUT taken! Not a percentage stroke with third man in place. Back of a length outside off, Azam plays that nicely, sways away from the line, arches his back and gets underneath the ball. Ramps the ball but can't get it over slip, more over gully, and because of that, third man is able to get around and complete a good catch at the third man boundary. May have been a b Hazlewood to Malik, SIX runs oh yea. What a shot. Full and straight and speaking about percentage strokes, how's this? Presents the full face of the bat and lofts over mid-on. Clean ball-striking. Clears the boundary. Experience. Starc to Shafiq, OUT that's Shafiq gone. Extremely poor shot. Full and wide from Starc, the ball was moving away. He had o reason to play with this being Starc's last over. Shafiq, though, wanted to drive through cover. Ended up stretching out for the ball, but it was too wide. Had no control, no balance and got a thick outside edge to Wade 10.17pm Pakistan completely outplayed Australia today, absolutely no doubt about that. It began by tying down Australia with spin. Changes in pace, cutters, pace off, change-ups. Australia could only manage 220. Pakistan knew what they were doing all along in that chase. Took their time and put the odd ball away. That's all they needed. A clinical bowling performance followed with a clean, effi Pakistan won by 6 wickets (with 14 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mohammad Hafeez, PAK","Pakistan 4 for 221 (Hafeez 72, Malik 42*) beat Australia 220 (Smith 60, Amir 3-47) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Not since the days of a young Wasim Akram and a befuddled Allan Border had Pakistan beaten Australia at the MCG, in a match played as part of the one-off World Championship of Cricket. And not since January 2005 had Pakistan beaten Australia in Australia, in any format. Pakistan ended both those dry spells in a contest that illustrated familiar strengths for the visitors and plenty of increasingly tiresome weaknesses among the hosts. On a sluggish surface Australia's batsmen were cornered by Pakistan's spinners, allowing for a chase within the modest reach of their batsmen. Earlier in the day Australia had unveiled their touring party for a Test series in India next month, with the spin bowler Mitchell Swepson speaking outside the MCG."
"12.50pm Australia have won the toss and opt to bat. Not the greatest of starts to the ODIs for Pakistan. Amir to Warner, OUT what a delivery! He has been doing it all afternoon. Superb bowling. Amir pushes this one fuller and straighter. Warner sees something on middle and chooses to flick into the leg side but is undone by substantial away swing. The ball beats the flick by some distance and clips the top of the bails. Wow, he wasn't close to that. Not a great shot. Amir to Smith, OUT edged and gone! Another peach from Amir. Fantastic captaincy from Azhar, after all the flak he's received. Bowls it full and wide. Asks Smith to drive through the vacant cover region. Smith can't say no with his form, can he? His feet are rooted in the crease, his drive is away from his body. The ball holds its line outside off and takes the edge. A routine catch for Rizwan. Hasan Ali to Lynn, SIX runs smashed. Back of a length from Hasan Ali and Lynn BBL's the ball way into the stands. A heave waaaaay over midwicket. Just so easy for Lynn Imad Wasim to Head, OUT edged and gone. Wasim strikes. Pakistan chipping away. Head looked all at sea against the non-turning spin of Wasim. A flat delivery outside off, skids on with the arm again. Head looks to slap a drive through cover but plays inside the line, like he has been doing against Wasim. The ball kisses the outside edge and settles in Rizwan's gloves. Good catch too Imad Wasim to Marsh, OUT this time there is some turn, and Marsh nicks off! That excellent length again, never quite up there to drive, on off stump. Marsh chances the drive, and only manages a thin edge through to Rizwan Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 wide short down leg, Maxwell misses his pull and it's given wide. Pakistan appeal for a caught behind. Replays confirm there was no bat anywhere near the ball Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 wide bouncer outside off, maybe the slower bouncer. Maxwell wanted to pull, but it rises too high for that and he aborts his shot Hasan Ali to Maxwell, OUT gone! Hasan Ali has varied his pace beautifully in this over, and he does Maxwell with another little offcutter. Looks to flick it over midwicket, is through his shot too early, and it loops up off the high part of his bat and midwicket takes the simplest of catches Amir to Wade, SIX runs huuuuuuge! A slower ball on leg, Wade gets forward and swings high and deep over midwicket. A long boundary, clears it comfortably Imad Wasim to Cummins, 1 leg bye flat down leg, Cummins is rapped on the pads but the ball pings off towards third man for a leg bye Amir to Warner, no run nice start. 139 kph, good length delivery on off, the ball seaming away. Warner can only defend. Keep six there. Amir to Warner, OUT what a delivery! He has been doing it all afternoon. Superb bowling. Amir pushes this one fuller and straighter. Warner sees something on middle and chooses to flick into the leg side but is undone by substantial away swing. The ball beats the flick by some distance and clips the top of the bails.

Marsh chances the drive, and only manages a thin edge through to Rizwan Wahab Riaz to Wade, 1 wide bouncer, off-target, ends up angling it a fair way down the leg side Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 1 wide bouncer outside off, maybe the slower bouncer. Maxwell wanted to pull, but it rises too high for that and he aborts his shot Hasan Ali to Maxwell, OUT gone! Hasan Ali has varied his pace beautifully in this over, and he does Maxwell with another little offcutter. Looks to flick it over midwicket, is through his shot too early, and it loops up off the high part of his bat and midwicket takes the simplest of catches Amir to Wade, SIX runs huuuuuuge! A slower ball on leg, Wade gets forward and swings high and deep over midwicket. A long boundary, clears it comfortably Imad Wasim to Cummins, 1 leg bye flat down leg, Cummins is rapped on the pads but the ball pings off towards third man for a leg bye Amir to Wade, 1 wide 140 kph, a short loopy bouncer outside off, a wide called Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 wide down the leg side again, Sharjeel misses another flick, but this one is wide enough to be called wide Stanlake to Sharjeel, 1 leg bye oh man. He's almost headed that to third man. Bouncer angling across him, rising to head high. Very awkward to evade. In the end he dropped his wrists and ducked his head while looking away, and it hits the top of the helmet and ricochets to third man. It's taken off the rim of one of the air inlets Cummins to Hafeez, 1 wide bouncer over off stump, Azhar ducks but he doesn't need to. Rises well over head height Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT gone! Akmal has played another terrible stroke. What was he trying to do? Clear mid-on with a pull? Poor choice of stroke. Back of a length from Starc outside off, hustles Akmal for pace. Akmal tries to forehand the ball into the leg side but may have been too late to the ball. Splices the ball straight to mid-on, who takes an easy catch. Ooh, actually that may have been the offcutte Cummins to Babar Azam, OUT Azam was looking so good, then he does this. A stroke fraught with so much risk with a slip in place. Back of a length from Cummins, seaming back in. Azam tries to steer the ball to third man for one. The inward movement helps the ball rap the glove and just lob to Smith at slip. An easy catch. But well bowled too. Got some bounce and extra oomph in his delivery. Head to Rizwan, 1 leg bye on the pads, off the pads for one to fine leg 9.05pm And that is that. Australia go 1-0 up in the series, and showed they have what it takes to win even when their powerful top order fails to click. How will Pakistan respond? Join us day after tomorrow at the MCG to find out. Until then, goodbye! Player of the match is Matthew Wade, AUS","Australia 9 for 268 (Wade 100*, Maxwell 60, Hasan Ali 3-65) beat Pakistan 176 (Faulkner 4-32, Cummins 3-33) by 92 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Matthew Wade performed a commendable salvage operation for Australia to put up a total that proved well beyond the reach of Pakistan in the first ODI at an enervating Gabba. Defeat may be particularly ruinous for the visitors given an apparent hamstring tear to the captain Azhar Ali, who must now be in grave doubt for the rest of the tour. Azhar suffered the injury early in Pakistan's ultimately doomed pursuit, and did it no favours when coming back out to bat at the fall of the sixth wicket. Brisbane's hot and humid weather also claimed an Australian casualty, with the debutant Billy Stanlake appearing in some distress and unable to add to his initial three overs. Fortunately for Australia's captain Steven Smith, he had plenty of other bowling options to call upon, including the exceptionally-tidy Travis Head."
"8:44pm Looks like Australia will start with spin. Ashton Agar has the ball and is positioning his long-off fielder. Zampa to Boult, 1 wide legbreak tossed up wide outside off, probably hoping Boult stepped out. He doesn't, lets it go Kane Richardson to Jamieson, 1 wide full and down leg side, left alone I thought with ball we adapted really well, we learnt from the way NZ bowled. Pace off the ball was going to be important, the way Agar bowled in that powerplay was important. He's such a dynamic player (Maxi), he always wants to be in the action - he's a great player to balance out your side. We've been trying to be a bit more aggresive with the batting but when you lose wickets, it gets tougher, so we looked to take it deeper [today] and got some good momentum going into the 10:23pm And that is all from our live coverage of this game. See you for the decider on Sunday! Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 156 for 6 (Finch 79*, Sodhi 3-32) beat New Zealand106 (Jamieson 30, K Richardson 3-19) by 50 runs A crucial innings from captain Aaron Finch on a tricky pitch, as he became Australia's leading scorer in men's T20Is, followed by a tight display in the field enabled them to take the series to a decider in Wellington on Sunday as the home side's batting disappointed for the second game running. On a surface being used for the fourth time in three days (with two more matches to come), scoring was much tougher than when Australia put more than 200 on the board in the previous game. New Zealand had control for the majority of the time in the field - Ish Sodhi and Trent Boult taking five wickets between them - but Finch took full toll in the final over of the innings as Kyle Jamieson was plundered for 26. New Zealand were under pressure from the start of the chase and could not make a dent on the target in the powerplay. Australia's three spinners - Ashton Agar, Adam Zampa and Glenn Maxwell - produced combined figures of 11-0-49-6."
"6.50pm Sri Lanka win the toss and bowl for the third time this series. Malinga to Klinger, (no ball) Malinga apologies, Klinger acknowledges it. Full-toss above the waist, the line is outside leg, the batsman ducks under it. That probably slipped out of Malinga's hands Malinga to Head, SIX runs This is even better from Head. Malinga can't get the yorker right again. Full on off stump, right in the slot, launched over Siriwardana at long-on Malinga to Turner, OUT Kapu pulls off a cracking catch now. He dashes in from long-on, dives forward, and takes it. Turner backs away outside leg. Malinga chases him and cramps him with a full-toss which is dragged away to Kapu. He did well to attack the catch Jhye Richardson to Munaweera, SIX runs back of a length on middle, Munaweera ventures deep in the crease and biffs it over long-on for a six Cummins to Upul Tharanga, 1 leg bye 145.4ks missile on the leg stump, Tharanga is beaten for pace. The ball grazes the thigh and rolls to the leg side Cummins to Prasanna, 1 wide bouncer on middle, ducks under it. Too high, called a wide Faulkner to Prasanna, 1 wide slower on from Faulkner, slips down the leg side for a wide, Prasanna looked to thwack that behind square leg for four Player of the match is Adam Zampa, AUS","Australia 6 for 187 (Klinger 62, Finch 53) beat Sri Lanka 146 (Faulkner 3-20, Zampa 3-25) by 41 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Adam Zampa's dismantling of Sri Lanka arrived too late to salvage the series for Australia, and also too late for his skiddy, accurate wristspin to be considered for the Test team to face India in Pune from Thursday. The frequent omission of Zampa from Australia's ODI and Twenty20 sides - despite an excellent record in both formats - has been a mystery for quite some time, and there appeared to be thinly veiled frustration on the part of the bowler as he accounted for the series' pivotal player Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedara and Dasun Shanaka in quick succession to push a target of 188 beyond the reach of the visitors. His wickets came not from any extravagant turn but instead useful changes of pace and unrelenting attack on the stumps, winning a pair of back foot lbw verdicts from the umpire Paul Wilson either side of another slider that bowled Kapugedara between bat and pad. Australia's selectors had admitted to choosing an ""attacking"" spinner in Mitchell Swepson over what the panel's chairman Trevor Hohns called a more ""defensive"" operator in Zampa. Sri Lanka made a rapid start to their chase but a sturdy Australian effort with the bat meant that they did not have much room to lose momentum."
"6.55pm Sri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga wins the toss and chooses to bowl again. Sanjaya to Finch, OUT No fireworks from Finch in front of his home fans. Sanjaya has his man. Good length ball, angled in and kicks up at the batsman again. Finch is early into the shot, looking to work to leg. He jumps off the ground, and ends up lobbing a return catch. This surface has something in it for the seamers Kulasekara to Klinger, 1 wide full and drifting down leg for another leg-side wide Munaweera to Dunk, SIX runs Dunk makes room outside leg, opens up the off side. Takes this length ball from outside off and launches it over cover for a six Munaweera to Dunk, SIX runs Dunk goes downtown now. Tossed up and outside off, Dunk moves away outside leg again. He smashes it disdainfully over the long-off fence. This Munaweera experiment has backfired for SL Gunaratne to Dunk, OUT bowled'em. Just 88ks, the lack of pace does 'em in. Looks like another slower cutter, dips, creating distance between the bat and the pitch. Dunk aims a big swipe and does not touch it. Asela kisses the off stump Sanjaya to Klinger, OUT a big appeal for caught behind from the bowler and the keeper. Nogajski takes his own sweet time and then raises his finger. Good length and outside off, Klinger reaches out with his hands, swishes and snicks behind. The snicko detects the outside edge. End of a sluggish knock from Klinger Kulasekara to Head, OUT The drop costs Sri Lanka nothing. Munaweera will be relieved. Length and angling away outside off, bounces at the batsman. Head simply steers it into the gloves of Dickwella Prasanna to Turner, OUT Excellent catch from Siriwardana at long-off. Starkly contrasts with those drops from Kapu and Munaweera. Tossed up and spins away outside off, Turner flat-bats this legbreak in the air. Siriwardana moves swiftly to his right, dives across, and snaps it up Malinga to Faulkner, OUT 114.1ks slower dipping yorker from Malinga. How does he do that? Slings in on middle, dips and kisses the front pad. Nogajski rules him out. Hotspot picks up an inside edge. Faulkner has to go, though Sanjaya to Henriques, SIX runs slower short ball on off stump, hip-high ball, moves back and swats it powerfully over midwicket Malinga to Paine, OUT Malinga implores, Paine given out lbw. Another slower full ball from Malinga. Dips in front of Paine, who was shaping up for a cute little scoop over Dickwella's head. He is pinned in front. Second wicket for Malinga. It was crashing into leg stump. The ball looped off the pad into the gloves of the keeper Kulasekara to Cummins, OUT Kulasekara can bowl yorkers too. Yorker, tails in late into the leg stump. Pings the toe and disturbs the leg stump. Too good for a lower-order batsman. It would have even dismissed a top-order batsman Kulasekara to Tye, OUT appeal for lbw, Simon Fry now raises his finger. Full and swerves in to beat the inside edge - Tye was looking to work it across the line - traps him in front of leg. But I guess this was heading down leg Kulasekara to Jhye Richardson, OUT bowled'em. Kulaseakara closes the innings with a wicket. Very full on the leg stump, kisses the pad and hits the stumps. Richardson does not connect with the wild slog. He bags a golden duck on debut. Three wickets in four balls from Kulasekara Faulkner to Dickwella, OUT Dickwella attempts the scoop and the ball balloons into the gloves of the keeper. It bounces more than Dickwella expected. He pre-meditates, going low, and attempting to dink it over his shoulder. The ball misses the bat, misses the glove, grazes the shoulder on its way to Paine Jhye Richardson to Mendis, OUT Third-ball wicket for Richardson on debut. His team-mates mess his hair up. Back of a length and outside off, skids through in the corridor. Mendis swishes a long way away from hid body and nicks it behind. The outside edge flies to the right of Paine. He stretches across and completes a fine catch Henriques to Prasanna, 2 wide full cutter drifting down leg, off the thigh and rolls to the keeper. Given as a wide, though Henriques to Gunaratne, SIX runs back of a length and outside off, wrong length again. Asela clears his front leg again, slamming it high over midwicket Tye to Gunaratne, SIX runs Asela clears mid-off, again. Goes all the way. Good length and outside off, hoisted flat over the fielder. What a key strike 11pm Phew, look the celebrations in the Sri Lanka camp. Asela sets off on a celebratory sprint. His team-mates finally track him down and mob him. SL slid to 40 for 5. They needed 79 off the last seven overs, and 48 off the last three. Asela said no problem and caught fire, lacing three successive sixes off Henriques and then muscling three boundaries in the Sri Lanka won by 2 wickets Player of the match is Asela Gunaratne, SL","Sri Lanka 8 for 176 (Gunaratne 84*, Tye 3-37) beat Australia 173 (Henriques 56, Klinger 43, Kulasekara 4-31) 2 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Asela Gunaratne orchestrated a remarkable heist to seal the T20 series for Sri Lanka with a match to play, stealing an outrageous victory over Australia in the first international match ever played at Geelong's Kardinia Park. For the second time in three days, Sri Lanka reached their target from the final ball of their chase, but whereas at the MCG they had needed only 18 off the last three overs, here they needed 48. Gunaratne ensured that they did it in style. Forty-eight off 18 balls became 36 off 12, and then came the over that turned things firmly in Sri Lanka's favour. Moises Henriques, who earlier had struck an unbeaten half-century to set Sri Lanka a target of 174, failed to find the right lengths and was plundered for three consecutive sixes by Gunaratne, as well as a four, and it left them requiring 14 from the final over, to be bowled by Andrew Tye."
"7.10pm Upul Tharanga wins his first toss as Sri Lanka T20I captain and chooses to bowl first. Sandakan to Klinger, OUT wrong'un, full on off stump, Klinger looks to slog it over the leg side. He did not pick the wrong'un I guess. Wanted to heave over the leg side, and ended up slicing an outside edge in the air. Malinga ventured in from point and clasped it, sliding on his knees Malinga to Henriques, 1 wide full and slung down the leg side, past the attempted flick Sanjaya to Henriques, OUT First international wicket for Sanjaya! Length ball on off, Henriques can't clear the long boundary. #MCGisbig. Holes out to Kapu at long-on. The shot was on, but the execution was bad, with the bat twisting in Henriques' hands 9.20pm Good workout for Malinga on return. He snapped up two catches in two overs, took two wickets. The wristspinners - Prasanna and Sandakan - slowed Australia down in the middle overs with combined figures of 8-0- 53-1 after Klinger and Finch added 76 for the first wicket. Sri Lanka's fielding, though, was sloppy. They need 169. Be back soon for the chase. Stanlake to Dickwella, 1 wide starts off with a wild leg-side wide. Paine makes a sprawling save behind the stumps Faulkner to Gunaratne, 1 leg bye Asela ventures across off, misses the sweep, and takes it on the pad outside the line Cummins to Gunaratne, FOUR runs four boundaries in six balls for Asela. Short of a length and outside off, Asela ramps it in the air to the right of deep third man now. Celebrates his maiden T20I fifty Turner to Siriwardana, OUT Two wickets in three balls for the debutant. Pushed through flatter and quicker, Siriwardana plays back and is pinned in front of leg stump. Was it heading down leg? I am sure this is missing the stumps. The umpire doesn't think so, and raises his finger. The tracker suggests it was heading down Faulkner to Prasanna, 1 wide back of the hand slower one again, this is too wide outside off. Past the tramline. Prasanna swishes and does not connect Faulkner to Prasanna, 1 leg bye 110.8ks slower ball on middle and leg, he eyes up the leg side and misses. The ball grazes the thigh and rolls to the off side Sri Lanka won by 5 wickets Player of the match is Asela Gunaratne, SL","Sri Lanka 5 for 172 (Gunaratne 52, Munaweera 44) beat Australia 6 for 168 (Finch 43, Malinga 2-29) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia's ""best of the Big Bash League"" took Sri Lanka to the final ball. The hosts and their three debutants fought to the finish against the visitors in front of a raucous crowd at the MCG, but a win offered Sri Lanka the chance to wrap up the series at Kardinia Park on Sunday. The Perth Scorchers' Andrew Tye was left with six runs to defend from the final over, and one from the final ball. Chamara Kapugedara surveyed the ring field then punched the winning boundary through the covers to secure the result. His composure ensured Sri Lanka finished in the ascendant after looking the more likely victors throughout their chase, largely due to a boundary count that outstripped the hosts, 21 to 13."
"Cummins to Brownlie, 1 wide 140 kph, goes for the bouncer, but it soars over Brownlie's head, even though he is ducking. Umpire Brown at square leg signals wide and his partner Palliyaguruge follows suit Cummins to Williamson, OUT what a beauty! Extra bounce, and darting in off the seam too. It's that movement that does him. The ball begins as a short one outside off so Williamson gets a late cut ready, but he is caught off guard because it rears up, cramps him for room and takes a little tickle off the inside edge through to the keeper. Great reward for a probing spell from Cummins. Cummins to Taylor, 1 wide digs it in short, and outside off, gains a little too much height off this hard pitch and is penalised for it Cummins to Taylor, 1 wide way too high, and way too far outside off. That's the third wide of the over. Walks back with a disheartened smile Faulkner to Broom, OUT huge nick and umpire Brown says off you go. Hits the seam and kicks up off the pitch. Takes the outside edge at the shoulder of Broom's bat as he comes forward to try and defend. Beautiful bowling, with just a little help from the pitch Faulkner to Taylor, 4 leg byes that's out of his T20 playbook, shuffling across to off stump and swinging across the line of a length ball. Misses it completely, of course, and gets leg byes to long leg Faulkner to Taylor, OUT pummels it... straight to deep square leg. Taylor walks off to a rousing ovation, but without him, New Zealand have no hope of getting to the kind of score they want. Good bowling from Faulkner, hitting a stump-to-stump line, changing his pace as often as possible Faulkner to Southee, SIX runs gets length and Southee winds up... this looks like six.. this should have been six a lot more easily... but Stoinis almost pulls off the most miraculous effort. He is on the edge of the deep midwicket boundary, leaping back sticking his right hand high and behind him to try and take a catch. Does so one-handed and sees Cummins running in from square leg on his peripheral vision, tries to toss it to him to complete the wicket. No luck there. And worse, the back of his boot stamps on the advertising triangles as he got hold of the ball. Great effort, though. Starc to Ferguson, OUT another yorker and the stumps are in disarray again. Ferguson's bat just doesn't come down quick enough. Starc just turns around after seeing the bails fly. He wants to get this over with, put his feet up, bag the trophy and go home. Seems to be getting some late away swing as well Starc to Santner, SIX runs finishes off with a six. This is length again from Starc and Santner is able to get under it with a slog over deep midwicket Southee to Finch, SIX runs glorious stroke! Full and swinging away, Finch gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts him through the line. The ball sails over the ropes at long-off. Just an extension of his arms but the timing was outstanding. Little or no followthrough on that occasion. Big, broad blades, yes, but the timing was super too Southee to Finch, 1 wide slower delivery but he gets the angle wrong, way down leg and on the bounce to the keeper. 111 kph Santner to Finch, 1 run pulled to wide long-on, six off the over Williamson to Finch, SIX runs into the hospitality area at deep midwicket. Sure, it was the longer boundary but this was a full toss that had to be hit. Connected cleanly Williamson to Finch, 1 wide fired down leg, Finch lets it go Ferguson to Stoinis, 5 wide digs it in short, Stoinis ignores it, Latham can't hope to move quickly enough to his left Ferguson to Stoinis, 1 wide too short and way over the batsman's head. Correct decision from the umpire Neesham to Cummins, 1 wide short and way down the leg side. Not quick enough too to induce fear in the batsmen Santner to Starc, SIX runs he's clobbered that over cow corner. Tossed up on leg stump, Starc takes him on and gets enough muscle on the slog. Big over, this isn't over by any means 6.50pm I wouldn't want to be picking the Man of the Match award, folks. Ross Taylor came up with a special century and two outstanding slip catches. Trent Boult ran in fast, swung the ball late and kept chipping away at the wickets every time his captain threw him the ball. Who is your pick? For the record, New Zealand have moved above India to No. 3 in the ODI rankings as a result of this win. Celebration all around. Williamson is being presented the trophy by Sir Richard Hadlee. They're all smiles, this has been a series win well-deserved. Hope you enjoyed our coverage, but New Zealand's home season is far from over. They host South Africa now for one T20I at Eden Park (17 February) followed by an ODI series and three Tests. Do join us then. There's plenty of cricket elsewhere to keep you connected. Hope to see you soon. Cheers and thanks for joining us. Player of the match is Trent Boult, NZ","New Zealand 281 for 9 (Taylor 107, Brownlie 63, Faulkner 3-59, Starc 3-63) beat Australia 257 (Finch 56, Head 53, Boult 6-33) by 24 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details This was some sort of day for New Zealand.

"Ball to Head, 1 leg bye flicked away Wood to Maxwell, OUT caught in the deep! Brilliant from Roy! Short ball from Wood, hit hard and flat, it's six all the way, but round swoops Roy, plucking the ball above his head, foot a millimetre from the line, then in that now-typical-but-still-awesome manner, tosses the ball up as his momentum takes him over, then gathering when back in play. Rashid to Wade, OUT googly! Wades reads it about as well as I can read Hindi. Three fielders converge but Rashid calls for his own catch as the ball loops straight up in the air, and England are really taking control in the slog-overs now Rashid to Starc, OUT that's terrible! An attempted googly, comes out as a leg-stump full toss, Starc slaps across the line as if substituting his bat for a damp tuna-fish, and up loops another facile catch, this time for Root behind the stumps! Wood to Cummins, 1 leg bye a slip in place as Wood hammers out a threatening length, but deflected away, Rashid to Cummins, OUT too easy for Rashid, who finishes his spell with a four-for! A lollipop push straight back to the bowler, neither forward nor back, and utterly unsure of which direction that would spin. England are rampant! Wood to Zampa, OUT full toss, and bowled! Zampa didn't fancy staying in line one little bit, gave himself room, and was in no position to protect his timbers as Wood splattered his off pole! Ball to Maxwell, 1 leg bye good delivery, nibbling off the seam and tucking up the right-hander. A deflection into the off side 2.03pm Well, that was a tale of two halves. Australia had visions of 340 at one stage, but Mark Wood's extraction of Steven Smith was a game-changer, before Adil Rashid got stuck into a lower-middle-order that has been confined to the nets for most of a very soggy tour. Eight wickets between them and great support from the rest. England will need 278 to Starc to Roy, OUT struck in front, Roy in a tangle... and after an age to think about it, Kumar Dharmasena raises his finger! Roy doesn't consult with his partner but quickly requests a review, but straight away this looks optimistic Hazlewood to Morgan, SIX runs dug in short and Morgan dumps the ball into the crowd! Always worth testing him with the short ball but Morgan is seeing it like Bravestarr (eyes of the hawk) and swings it up and away over the rope Hazlewood to Morgan, SIX runs huge. Simply huge. A round-house bottom-handed dump-truck of a shot, down the track, into the stands! ""The bashing about Aussies is unfair, they didn't have a full game in the tournament. If rain wasn't a problem, Aussies, NZ and Bangladesh all would have ended up with 2 points,"" points out chotu. True, but even that's worthy of a little Aussie-ribbing, no? They're ranked No. 2 in the world ""So the last time Australia won a game in CT was way back in 2009."" That is spot on, Nilesh, as they were knocked out with only one point, from a washout, in 2013. ""Why are 90% of comments about Bangladesh? This win is a very big deal for England, and an exceptional performance all round!!"" Well, Jez, crushing England victories are so de rigueur nowadays. But you're right, they have made another big statement about their white-ball capabilities... Player of the match is Ben Stokes, ENG","England 240 for 4 (Stokes 102*, Morgan 87) beat Australia 277 for 9 (Head 71, Finch 68, Smith 56, Wood 4-33, Rashid 4-41) by 40 runs (DLS method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details As per a chorus in the Eric Hollies Stand cribbed from Three Lions and directed at Aaron Finch, Australia are going home. That they are doing so has less to do with damp English weather than the verve of the home side, personified by the pace of Mark Wood, the guile of Adil Rashid, the leadership of Eoin Morgan and the raw power of Ben Stokes. This was a meeting between a confident, aggressive England favoured to lift the Champions Trophy and an out-of-season Australia playing their first completed match of the trip. With the bat and then the ball, Steven Smith's side hinted at their full capability, but were unable to follow through as Morgan's men proved much the more resilient team when challenged. Having themselves knocked out New Zealand, a delighted Bangladesh are into the semi-finals."
"10.18pm And that is all from our live coverage tonight. We'll see you soon for the fourth T20I. Player of the match is Ashton Agar, AUS","Australia 4 for 208 (Maxwell 70, Finch 69, Philippe 43, Sodhi 2-32) beat New Zealand 144 (Guptill 43, Agar 6-30, Meredith 2-24) by 64 runs Aaron Finch emerged from his T20 slump with his first half-century in 27 innings, Glenn Maxwell turned on the pyrotechnics with some thrilling strokeplay, and Ashton Agar bettered his own record for Australia's best T20I figures as they kept the series alive with a 64-run victory in the third game at an empty stadium in Wellington. Riley Meredith made an eye-catching debut with his pace helping take crucial early wickets even as New Zealand initially managed to keep up with the steep asking rate, but couldn't maintain it to make a serious dip at the target. In the first half, the foundation for Australia was laid by a stand of 83 between Finch and Josh Philippe, and the latter part of the innings was powered by Maxwell's 31-ball 70 of which 62 runs came in boundaries. The eight overs from 10 to 18 brought 105 runs before New Zealand pulled it back somewhat. Martin Guptill and Devon Conway played well in the chase, but Agar took three wickets in the 13th over to end the contest on his way to a six-wicket haul - just the fourth bowler to achieve that feat in T20Is while also becoming the sixth to take multiple five-wicket hauls in the format."
"1.00pm Australia win the toss and elect to bat Yadav to Finch, 1 wide drifts down leg this time, wide. 137 kph, Umesh struggling. Bowling two lengths and two lines Hardik to Warner, 1 wide wow, that was waaay down leg, wide. Dhoni saved four by moving quickly Hardik to Warner, 1 wide another poor delivery, starts it too straight, drifts down leg. Dhoni stops the ball but rolls over it as he falls over. Ouch Axar Patel to Warner, SIX runs picks the length early and smashed. Short on middle, Warner picks the length early and nails his pull over midwicket. Six Chahal to Warner, SIX runs tossed up on leg stump, and Warner gets down low, front leg planted just next to the line, to slog-sweep hard and flat over midwicket Jadhav to Warner, OUT flat, shortish, angling into leg stump, and Jadhav has broken the partnership! The low release means there isn't too much bounce. Clears his front leg and looks to heave it over wide long-on, but it skids on and he hits it straighter than he'd like, and doesn't get the power he'd like, ends up hitting it straight to long-on Yadav to Finch, OUT looks to clobber it, such bad timing that mid-on takes a sitter. A slower ball outside off, Finch looks to drag the ball from well outside off, but it's right off the toe end, and straight to mid-on. So wide that it may have been a wide had Finch let that go Jadhav to Smith, 1 wide Smith backs away, then gets back inside the line, Jadhav follows him and concedes the wide Yadav to Smith, OUT chipped into the hands of midwicket. Australia are falling apart quickly. On the pads from Umesh, Smith gets outside the line and just clips it into the hands of midwicket, where Kohli is lurking. This game turning around quickly again Shami to Head, 1 wide drifts down leg, another wide Yadav to Head, 1 wide full and very wide outside off, left alone, wide called Yadav to Handscomb, OUT and bowled him off the next ball. Full and straight, seaming back in, Handscomb misses a big slog and the ball uproots off stump. Yikes. Just enough reverse swing for Shami. That's a fine cameo by a fine, young batsman 4.58pm All in all, that's quite a fine innings from Australia. But depending on which camp you are in, you'd be a little disappointed or slightly happy with that total of 334. When Warner and Finch were going, it looked like Australia were set for 360, maybe more. But India pulled it back nicely in the end through wickets. These are short boundaries, and a decent surface, and a fine batting unit. Cummins to Rahane, 1 leg bye ooh. Maybe a bit of inward nip. Back of a length, and he was looking to work that from just outside off stump through square leg. The ball beats his inside edge and rolls towards third man off his back thigh Zampa to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs doesn't matter what this ball was, legbreak, googly, flipper or a new invention. Just sees a bit of flight outside off and he gets down on one knee, moving his front leg out of the way to give him some swinging room, and slog-sweeps high and hard over wide long-on Head to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs shot! Fantastic execution from Rohit. Runs down, gets to the pitch, gets underneath and goes through with a clean swing, right over the bowler's head. Lovely stroke Coulter-Nile to Kohli, OUT happens again. Kohli has done it again, it was always going to happen and I think Coulter-Nile was playing for that. Good length outside off, the ball seaming back in, Kohli tries to dab this down to third man, but it takes the inside edge and hits the off stump. That's another error from Kohli, and the worst thing is he has repeated the mistake from Kolkata. It Cummins to Jadhav, 1 wide strays down the leg side, another wide, another extra Zampa to Pandey, 1 leg bye a touch short, angling down leg. Not short enough to pull. Looks to help it fine but can't put bat to ball. Only hits his upraised front pad, and rolls away for a leg bye towards fine leg. Belatedly, Smith as decided to review for lbw, but no way is that lbw. I haven't even seen the replays,and I know impact was outside leg stump and it was missing leg by a lon Cummins to Jadhav, 1 leg bye out of his crease again and he gets a bit of inward nip with this back-of-a-length ball. Sneaks under the attempted horizontal-bat swat and hits his pad, high up 9.55pm And that is that. A good win for Australia, turns around some pretty ordinary away form, and a few things to ponder for India ahead of the final ODI, which is in Nagpur on Sunday. Be sure to join us for that game. Until then, goodbye! Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 334 for 5 (Warner 124, Finch 94, Handscomb 43, Umesh 4-71) beat India 313 for 8 (Jadhav 67, Rohit 65, Rahane 53, Richardson 3-58) by 21 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details It is tough to imagine an Australian side of the old 3-0 down in a series after the dominant positions they got themselves into in the three preceding games. In failing to capitalise fully on a 231-run opening stand, they left themselves susceptible to a fourth such reversal, but better fielding than India and excellent bowling from their quicks made sure India's ODI juggernaut was halted at nine wins in a row, still their longest streak. David Warner scored a hundred in his 100th ODI, Aaron Finch biffed his way to 94 and to the top of the runs chart this series despite playing only two matches, but Australia managed just 102 runs in the last 15 overs, setting India 335. For a good part of the chase, India seemed on course to add to their record of five successful chases of 330 or more and Australia's unwanted record of eight unsuccessful defences of 330 or more, but their fielders and bowlers redeemed themselves on a damp outfield where it couldn't have been easy to grip the ball. The moment of magic came from the captain Steven Smith, who has so far had an ordinary series in the field, dropping two catches in Chennai and one in Indore."
"Hardik to Warner, OUT Pandya's quick offcutter provides India with the breakthrough! Back of a length, skids in, then swerves away. A crease-bound Warner aims to punch it away through the covers, playing for the angle. Pandya beats the outside edge and hits the top of middle Chahal to Finch, SIX runs liberally tossed up outside off, breaks in, Finch sizes up the flight of the googly and launches it straight of long-on for a six Kuldeep to Finch, SIX runs a mis-timed six. Wanted to go over long-on or midwicket but the ball turns, takes the outside half and travels straight over the bowler for six. Just clears the boundary too Kuldeep to Finch, OUT taken at deep midwicket. Finch's belligerence ends. It's full and Finch sees an opportunity to hit it over midwicket, but Finch can't get underneath the length, which means his heave goes straight and flat to Jadhav at deep midwicket, who takes it awkwardly. A white towel falls off, and Finch thinks it's the ball. But has to walk off. Fine innings from Finch, has put Australia in command Kuldeep to Maxwell, 1 wide the seam-up delivery, took everyone by surprise but it's down leg. 90 kmph. Kuldeep to Smith, OUT easily taken at long-off. It's the googly outside off, Smith wanted to get closer to the ball and hit it straighter but the ball skews off the outside half and lobs to Bumrah at long-off. Looking into the sun is Bumrah, but he has his sunglasses on. Kuldeep has been a touch expensive, but has got two big wickets when they're trying to go after him. Kuldeep to Stoinis, SIX runs enough muscle behind that to clear long-off. A googly outside off, Stoinis got underneath it and swung cleanly over long-off. He may have read that well Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 wide full and too wide outside off, called. A few too many extras here Bumrah to Handscomb, OUT sensational catching from Pandey. A slower delivery outside off is hit nicely to long-off, it looks like six for the entirety of its trajectory until Pandey gets around to his right, takes a reverse-cupped catch, realises he was stepping over the boundary and threw it back up in the air. Then, he nonchalantly got back in and took the catch, no fuss, no trouble. Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 wide a wide knuckle ball outside off, well outside the tramline too, wide called Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 leg bye skiddy, 132 kph, full around leg, beats Stoinis' inside edge and hits him on the back leg Bumrah to Head, OUT goes straight through , 119 kph, it's a slower ball on middle and leg, the offcutter. Head plays with an angled bat, trying to find midwicket, but that means the ball has enough room to go through his flick and hit the stumps. Middle stump is uprooted. Australia losing their way Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 wide the wide slower delivery that is too wide. Called a wide 5.43pm Hello, again. Thanks, Nikhil. From 224 for 1, Australia had slumped to 275 for 6. The visitors managed only 38 in their last six overs to finish with a below-par 293 for 6. Will the pitch play better under lights as India's captain Virat Kohli suggested at the toss? India need 294 to wrap up the series. Rohit walks out to bat with Rahane. Cummins is armed with the new ball. He tears in from over the wicket with two slips to back him up Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, 2 wide very full and veering down leg, beats the glance, beats the keeper too Coulter-Nile to Rahane, 1 leg bye skidding into the thigh, 142ks, Rahane misses the flick, as the ball kisses the pad and rolls to leg Cummins to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs 145ks bouncer outside off, Rohit picks the length early. Rocks back and crunnnnnches a pull over long leg. Sends the ball to the second tier. Whoa, what a shot!. He had scooped a similar rapid ball from Chameera for a six in Sri Lanka Coulter-Nile to Rahane, 1 leg bye leg-side ball, deflected down to long leg Coulter-Nile to Hardik, 1 leg bye short on off, Pandya misses a pull, the ball creeps underneath and hits him in the midriff. Ouch. A leg bye, more a groin bye Cummins to Hardik, 1 wide strays down leg for a wide. 140 kph 9.18pm Not many ODI chases have been as clinical and as convincing as that this year. Chasing 294, India got a fine start via fifties from Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma, and that was it really. Australia just did not have the depth or personnel to challenge India's strong batting thereon. India did stutter, but they now have nine wins on the bounce, consistency that has earned them the tag of the best team in the world in this format. Australia were well short, 350 may have been a par score but as soon as they India won by 5 wickets (with 13 balls remaining) Player of the match is Hardik Pandya, INDIA","India 294 for 5 (Pandya 78, Rohit 71, Rahane 70, Cummins 2-54) beat Australia 293 for 6 (Finch 124, Smith 63, Bumrah 2-52, Kuldeep 2-75) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Between January 2013 and the start of this series, India-Australia ODIs had produced an average first-innings score of 321. The first two ODIs bucked that high-scoring trend, with India defending 281 and then 252, but a belter of a pitch in Indore seemed set to catalyse a return to the old order. Coming back from a calf injury, Aaron Finch scored his eighth ODI hundred and put on 154 for the second wicket with Steven Smith to project visions of 350 into Australia's minds. But thanks to their wristspinners, and then their two expert death bowlers, India kept them to 293 for 6, taking five wickets and only conceding 77 in the last 14 overs. Australia didn't get a sniff thereafter, as seventies of varying moods and tempos from Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane at the top of the order and Hardik Pandya at No."
"Stoinis to Rahane, 1 wide the bowler doesn't help by bowling a length ball down leg, he dives low to collect it. Wide called. Rahane had an opportunity to tickle it fine Agar to Pandey, OUT goes through. Pandey has struggled against pace this series. That's not a good shot. Hurried for pace again, goes back and looks to cut a straight ball. There is a hint of turn too. Both his feet are in the air as he missed the cut. A nothing shot, an awful shot. The ball clips the top of off. Put himself under pressure with so many dot balls, when he felt he needed a scoring shot, he needed to play it off a good ball Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 bye Kohli steals a bye. Wade is in the wars. A slower delivery outside off, bounces in front of Wade and hits him somewhere near the groin. Wade can't move. Kohli realises that and gets one, sensational game awareness. The ball was by his feet Stoinis to Jadhav, SIX runs don't give him width. It's short, it's wide, it's an invitation and Jadhav accepts. He gets underneath the length intentionally and carves a cut over backward point for six Coulter-Nile to Jadhav, OUT and gone. Jadhav tries to get underneath and cut again but it was too full for that. He may have been better off trying to play that down, instead he brought his bat from down to up, which means the ball will only go up. The full length means there isn't enough elevation and Maxwell, at backward point, gobbles it up. Coulter-Nile to Kohli, OUT and chopped on! Kohli falls for 92. The ball has been seaming back in, Kohli chooses the wrong option of playing a dab down to third man, the ball takes the inside edge and hits the stumps. Maybe his first mistake of the day. Fantastic innings anyway Cummins to Kuldeep, OUT oh yes. Wade will feel a lot better now, mentally at least. Full and wide outside off, Kuldeep wafts with his weight firmly on the back foot. Gets a thick outside edge that flies towards Wade, who wanted to go with both hands, but improvised midway through knowing that he can't get there. So he stuck out his left hand, behind his back and hung on. One of the better catches you'll see Kane Richardson to Hardik, OUT smashed! But straight down to long-off. A slower full toss outside off, and intentionally bowled that wide outside off. Pandya hits it decently but not well enough. Finds Warner Ajinkya Rahane: We were looking to get 260-270, but 250 is decent. I knew if I take my time, I could play my shots. We wanted to disrupt their plans. We were looking to get 290, in between was not easy to rotate the strike, wicket was two paced. Really challenging conditions. 5.43pm This isn't exactly what India would have wanted, a score of 252. But this is not a batting surface, it's slow and two-paced. Australia will definitely take that, especially when Kohli and Rahane were going so well. But Kohli's wicket, after a typically fluent 92, slowed down India to the point where all they could aim for was close to 270. They fell short of that too. Australia, despite their batting struggles, will fancy their chances in this game. Shashank will be back with Bumrah to Cartwright, 1 leg bye late on the attempted flick, this length ball comes back in and hits him on the pad and deflects wide of Dhoni as they steal a leg-bye Bhuvneshwar to Cartwright, OUT this is almost like how he got Hafeez on his T20I debut. String of dot balls may have played on Cartwright's mind. This is a good length delivery just around off, Cartwright isn't sure if this one's going away or coming in. Pokes at the delivery without any conviction and sees the ball beat the inside edge and crash into the stumps. Bhuvneshwar's foot was very close to the line, but Cartwright has been told he can continue walking. Chahal to Maxwell, 1 wide tosses this up outside off to beat Maxwell in flight as he looks to slap this away. Harsh call from the umpire, who thought this was way outside off Chahal to Maxwell, OUT there's the magic ball. Dhoni isn't generally pumped up but boy, is he animated or what? Outstanding work by Chahal. Tossed it up but slowed it down nicely, he saw Maxwell charge down so lobbed this towards middle and leg, Maxwell, who senses he may not have gotten to the pitch of the ball, looks to turn this to the leg side, but the ball deflects off his right pad as the ball went between his legs, Dhoni collects it and smashes the stumps to leave Maxw Hardik to Stoinis, 1 wide full and very wide outside off, left alone, wide called Kuldeep to Stoinis, 1 wide drifts down leg for a wide Player of the match is Virat Kohli, INDIA","India 252 (Kohli 92, Rahane 55, Coulter-Nile 3-51, Richardson 3-55) beat Australia 202 (Stoinis 62*, Smith 59, Bhuvneshwar 3-9, Kuldeep 3-54) by 50 runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details New-ball swing; awkward, hit-the-deck seam; a pair of wristspinners turning their stock ball in opposite directions; a hustling, bustling, bouncer-happy allrounder. Seldom has an Indian ODI attack contained this much variety. Seldom has it all come together so spectacularly. During the innings break, India may have felt they could defend 252 on an Eden Gardens pitch that had been a little two-paced through their innings. They may have expected even more help for their bowlers under lights - it was one of the reasons Virat Kohli had cited for choosing to bat first."
"Cummins to Rahane, 1 wide The direction is wrong from Cummins. He spears a back-of-a-length delivery down the leg side. Left alone Coulter-Nile to Pandey, OUT Is Pandey out nicking behind as well? Australia are sure they have their man and keep celebrating... but umpire Erasmus asks them to hold on. Was it a bump ball? He refers it to the TV umpire. Very, very full and swinging away so very late outside off, Pandey jams his bat down on the ground. The ball did not touch the ground, though Faulkner to Jadhav, (no ball) Jadhav races down the track, Faulkner drags his length back and cramps the batsman for room. He might have eked out an inside edge onto the pad. Faulkner's front foot is on the line - harsh call - no-ball Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye good length, slight tail down leg side. Thuds him on the pad as he looks to flick Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, OUT holes out to deep square leg. An ordinary shot. Stoinis has been easily picked off with short bowling. But this one is 5 kph quicker than the last ball. Rohit goes for the hook, but the ball is way outside off. It's a regulation top edge and a regulation reverse-cup for Coulter-Nile. Umpires check for no-ball, but the crowd has already begun shouting Dhoni! Dhoni! Faulkner to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni forays down the track again... this time holes out to long-off. Faulkner's front foot is fine. Faulker pulled his length back, seeing Dhoni step out, on off stump. Dhoni gets it high on the bat and splices it to Warner for a head-high catch Hardik Pandya: It feels pretty amazing to be honest. They were on top, and the pressure was there. We lost wickets, and it was important for me to make a partnership with MSD. I mean, I have learnt a lot from him, still learning. We were speaking how we needs to change things up. It is a pleasure to play with him. I was trying to hit out before the Zampa over as well. Generally my plan is hitting straight - I don't care if long-off is there or long-on is there. If I connect well, I know 7:26pm You can scream the expletives on my behalf. There's some confusion. India are still on the field. For a moment, the groundsmen pause as they come on with the cover. The umpires ask them to stop. Then Kohli pesters them. Then Smith walks out and shrugs, aggressively. Then, the covers come on anyway. India are still on the field, though. 8:19pm India are out on the field. We're hearing of an 8:30pm resumption. The revised target will be 164 in 21 overs in that case. Hardik to Wade, 1 wide full cutter, floats down the leg side as Wade falls over a paddle sweep. Leg-side wide 10.15pm After Hardik Pandya and thala MS Dhoni thrilled the Chennai crowd and revived India to 281 for 7, rain cut Australia's chase to 164 in 21 overs. Bumrah sent Cartwright's off stump cartwheeling in his second over, then took an excellent catch to dismiss Smith. Warner flickered briefly as did Maxwell and Faulkner, but Australia were all at sea against India's wristspinners. Kuldeep and Chahal claimed combined figures of 9-0-63-5. Pandya, meanwhile, followed his career-best 83 with Player of the match is Hardik Pandya, INDIA","India 281 for 7 in 50 overs (Pandya 83, Dhoni 79, Coulter-Nile 3-44) beat Australia 137 for 9 in 21 overs (Maxwell 39, Chahal 3-30, Pandya 2-28) by 26 runs (DLS method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Hardik Pandya, who has one century and one five-for in professional cricket, continued to make mockery of conventional selection principles as he single-handedly won India the first ODI of the series. On a pitch with more bounce than an average Indian ODI surface, Pandya's sensational six-hitting combined with MS Dhoni's pragmatism to lift India from 87 for 5 to 281, but persistent drizzle converted the 282-run target into a theoretically-easier 164 in 21 overs. Pandya then introduced the world to his knuckle ball to send back Steven Smith and Travis Head. Smith had a rare shocker of a match, dropping two catches at slip, including Pandya, who went on to score 83 off 67 balls, and made Adam Zampa his fourth victim of three successive sixes in three months in international cricket. When Smith came out to bat, he looked to blast everything out of the ground, displaying uncharacteristic panic before failing to pick the knuckle ball and falling to an excellent catch by Jasprit Bumrah at short fine leg."
"Andrew McGlashan will step in for the start of the chase. Southee to Stoinis, 1 wide length ball outside off, tight to the guide line and called wide! Southee is furious because Stoinis had set up outside off Southee to Stoinis, SIX runs launched over deep midwicket! Short slower ball sat in the surface, he was back waiting and he muscled it way back over deep midwicket! Neesham to Stoinis, SIX runs launched over long on! Finally nails a full toss! Low full toss on middle, he used the bottom hand to lift it over long on That concludes our coverage from Dunedin. A fantastic game of T20I cricket. New Zealand go 2-0 up in the series. The two teams will meet again in Wellington for game three next Wednesday. Thanks for your company today. Goodbye and stay safe. Player of the match is Martin Guptill, NZ","New Zealand 219 for 7 (Guptill 97, Williamson 53, Neesham 45*, Kane Richardson 3-43) beat < b=""""> 215 for 8 (Stoinis 78, Philippe 45, Sams 41, Santner 4-31) by four runs <> New Zealand effectively won this game twice. For most of the day they dominated Australia with the bat and then the ball, to a point when the game looked to be heading for an early finish. Left in a hopeless position, Marcus Stoinis and Daniel Sams chanced their arms to close things up to a realistic scenario, only to lose their poise when the way to victory had re-opened, allowing Kane Williamson's men to hold their nerve in the tight finish that eventuated. New Zealand's momentum began with an overdue return to runs for Martin Guptill, swinging sweetly through the full ball as though on the golf course, with a pair of terrific supporting innings from Williamson and Jimmy Neesham - he and Guptill coshed no fewer than 14 sixes in Dunedin's first game between Australia and New Zealand since 2000. The Australia chase began fairly, stuttered and collapsed at the hands of Mitchell Santner, before getting the latest of revivals from Stoinis and Sams."
"This is Australia's final chance to walk away from Indian shores with a series win from this tour. A victory tonight will keep their chances alive heading into the third and final match. Australia have written a new and the most comprehensive chapter yet on collapses. It has been the overriding theme of their tour, and sadly, with two matches remaining before they fly back, they are yet to find answers. Here's Alagappan Muthu's preview to set things up while we wait for the toss. Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, OUT just like that, Barsapara has gone quiet. Not for long, though, as out comes the ever-popular Indian captain. Rohit pays for a lack of feet movement. Comes half-forward to this length ball that pitches around middle and off and beats him bu nipping in ever-so-slightly. Pings him plumb in front Behrendorff to Pandey, OUT oh, lovely delivery! Jason Behrendorff, you beauty! What a spell he's having! Short of good length, gets it to move away just enough and later still to find the outside edge of Pandey who is culpable of sticking his bat away from the body. Clear noise as he sent a nick through to Paine who holds on to a straightforward offering Behrendorff to S Dhawan, OUT that's a stunning catch from David Warner. Take a bow, skipper! He had to pedal back, and by no short distance, mind you. Falls over as he snaffles it having judged to perfection. Dhawan simply presented the full face of his bat to this fuller ball. He chips it over the in-field but it needed impeccable timing for the ball to carry all the way over the boundary. That's not to so, but this was always a 50-percent chance converted into a definite wicket by Warner's brilliance Zampa to Dhoni, 1 wide advances down and Zampa fires it wide of the batsman. Dhoni is equal to the task and manages to halt in his tracks and keep the backfoot planted. Had to really stretch there Zampa to Dhoni, OUT no cheeky work this time from Dhoni. He has been stumped clean and Zampa lets out a roar. Length ball, Dhoni advances again. It spins sharpy away from him and there is little the batsman can do from that position. Gets nowhere close to the ball and Paine completes a simple stumping Stoinis to Hardik, OUT straight into the hands of long-off. Pandya seemed like he could haul India to a decent total but he's gone now with 15 deliveries remaining. Tries to launch this fuller ball but it's just too full and that doesn't allow him the chance to get under it Zampa to Jadhav, OUT googly, and the stumps are a mess! Jadhav clears his front leg, seeing a loopy delivery in line with off stump. He shapes to launch it straight over Zampa's head, but the ball dips on him, it breaks the wrong way, and topples the stumps. Australia on the rise. On a massive rise. Coulter-Nile to Kuldeep, 1 wide short of a length, sprays it down the leg side and called a wide as the batsman misses the glance Tye to Kuldeep, OUT goes for a big slog and gets a top-edge that goes very high and Paine behind the stumps moves to his right and settles under it ""It was unbelievable.Bowling four upfront doesn't happen too often and I was lucky to do it.Bowling upfront and swinging the new ball is a strength and it is an honour to be opening the bowling for your country. The wicket was good, it was a little slow. Worked really hard for a long time. My first experience was just one over, my second one here has been very good. I'm taking nothing for granted. I have full faith in our batsmen chasing this down."" 8.45pm So India lose all their wickets. Jason Behrendorff set the template with his early burst and India never recovered. Australia exploited the early movement well and never let India to gather steam. This pitch still has something for the bowlers, so don't count India out yet. But remember that the dew has set in which will make India's job harder. Alagappan will be with you shortly for the chase. Over and out from me. Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 wide good length ball, darting down the leg side. Finch aims a flick, but can't connect. Would've been a great ball to Warner, who is at the other end, and who has been struggling against Bhuvi this tour That's all we have for you here from Guwahati, but there is plenty happening elsewhere in the world of sport. The Indian football team will have a chance to qualify for the AFC Asian Cup when they take on Macau tomorrow night. Head right over to ESPN.in to follow that, as well as the ongoing FIFA Under-17 World Cup Australia won by 8 wickets (with 27 balls remaining) Player of the match is Jason Behrendorff, AUS","Australia 122 for 2 (Henriques 62*, Head 47*) beat India 118 (Jadhav 27, Behrendroff 4-21, Zampa 2-19) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Like governments, Jason Behrendorff lured India with freebies up front before taxing them with four top-order wickets, a spell of play India never recovered from. Adam Zampa, who has not had the best of times on this trip, had his own back with two big middle-overs wickets to make sure Australia finally snapped their seven-match losing streak in T20Is against India. On a tacky pitch, with spin, seam and early swing on offer, India's batting seemed to fail to reassess what a good total was and fell 22 short of the 140-mark that might well have made for a tight chase. The way the match started, though, you might have thought of a score much higher than 140. The first ball was a gentle full toss that Rohit Sharma caressed to the point boundary; the third was a long half-volley that was crashed straight of mid-off."
"Bhuvneshwar to Warner, OUT chops on! Bhuvi roars in delight. Warner looks up at the heavens with a wry smile Ranchi just bellows. This is a good length ball, but the batsman continues to play with a horizontal bat shot. And though he tries not to power the ball at all, the fact that he made that miscalculation results in the inside edge and a blaze of red behind him Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide short ball, sliding into the right-hander, Maxwell tries to pull it over fine leg, but doesn't connect. Umpire calls wide for the line straying down leg Chahal to Maxwell, OUT that's the fourth time in four games that Chahal has toppled Maxwell, but he hides his face in his hands and flashes an embarrassed little grin. He knows this ball didn't deserve a wicket. Rank long hop. Destined to be smoked. Instead Maxwell pulls it straight to short midwicket Chahal to Head, 1 leg bye pushes it through off the front of the hand, so the ball simply skids straight on. Head looks to flick it, but has to settle for a leg bye towards fine leg Kuldeep to Finch, OUT bowled im! This is splendid bowling from Kuldeep. He's assessed that Finch has decided it will be sweep or nothing tonight against spin and loads up for the shot again. But this ball is a too full. it's too close. It demands a straight bat but by the time the alarm bells ring in Finch's head, he sees red behind him. The other thing Kuldeep did well is bowl it quicker so Hardik to Head, OUT keeps low, or at least lower than Head thinks and he chops on. Back of a length ball, from around the wicket. Head keeps leg side of the ball to whip it through midwicket, but he doesn't account for the low bounce that the experts predicted to happen on this pitch. Bumrah to Paine, OUT through him! Bowls him! Completely destroys him! Paine is hunched over with his stumps in disarray. He eventually drags himself off, perhaps wondering how he was so comprehensively beaten. It was a straight ball, but it swings just a tiny bit in. Then after pitching, it lurched at his leg stump with a vengeance. That it kept a little low wouldn't have helped the batsman Bumrah to Coulter-Nile, OUT ripper! Ranchi roars in appreciation of the perfect Bumrah yorker. Starts on middle and off. Curls in through the air. And Coulter-Nile is certainly not expecting that. Tries to block the ball from its target, but that late swing is too much to handle Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs lifts it over the long leg boundary! It's fair that he was set up for the shot with Coulter-Nile bowling length and down leg. But the ease with which Rohit dismissed it. Sheesh. Zampa to Kohli, no run drives to extra cover. Now its six off six for India to win. Good come back after conceding a boundary first ball Much of this win was the result of Kuldeep Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah's bowling - 2 for 16 and 2 for 17 respectively. Kuldeep was especially impressive, countering Aaron Finch's premeditated plans of sweeping him by bowling the perfect ball - quicker, fuller and tighter on the stumps to bowl him - setting the stage for Bumrah to take two wickets in one over in the death 11.00 pm That's all we have from the game. Thanks for joining us. Good night. India won by 9 wickets (with 3 balls remaining) (D/L method) Player of the match is Kuldeep Yadav, INDIA","India 49 for 1 (Kohli 22*) beat Australia 118 for 8 (Finch 42, Kuldeep 2-16, Bumrah 2-17) by nine wickets via DLS method Australia's batsmen had a dire time coping with a slow and low surface at the JSCA International Stadium and never recovered from the early muddle, eventually conceding the first T20I by nine wickets to India. Rain came down after Australia had limped to 118 for 8 in 18.4 overs, and by the time it subsided, India's chase had been shortened to six overs. They mowed down the 48-run target with minimal fuss despite the loss of Rohit Sharma. It was a pitch that had everything a batsman does not desire to see in a T20 game - variable bounce, lack of pace, grip, turn, and early on some movement in the air."
"Hardik to Finch, OUT mis-timed and gone. Australia's man in touch is gone. A full delivery outside off from Pandya, Finch tries to go over mid-off, the right ball to hit, but can only skew the ball off the outside half towards Bumrah at mid-off, who rusn to his left, takes the catch, but the ball pops out. The ball is rolling all over his legs like an insect, but Bumrah uses his feel, not his sight, to hold on somehow. Jadhav to Warner, 1 wide flat and quick, but far too wide outside off, wide Jadhav to Smith, 1 wide drifts down leg, Smith tries to paddle but doesn't make contact Jadhav to Smith, OUT gone! Jadhav does it again! A dangerous, dangerous shot, sweeping from the stumps - because of Jadhav's low arm, the ball follows a stump-to-stump trajectory right from the time it leaves his hand, when he's bowling from over the stumps. It's fairly flat, and it doesn't give him too much time to get down on one knee, and he's in a half-crouch when he swipes at it and misses, and he's struck absolute Jadhav to Stoinis, SIX runs down the track, and he's just cleared the leaping long-on fielder. Gets into a great position for the lofted drive, and hit it straight, so long-on had quite a distance to move to his left. Went a fair way over his head too Axar Patel to Head, OUT 94 kph, Head is gone. Premeditating the sweep, Axar is all too familiar with it. He fires it full and straight, Head tries to bail out of his sweep, but is in no position to improvise, the ball finds the gap, a big gap, between bat and pad and hits the stumps Bumrah to Stoinis, OUT given by umpire Erasmus. Stoinis reviews again. Umpire's call will decide this. Full on off, the ball has seamed back in prodigiously and struck Stoinis in front of off, beaten by discernible late lateral movement. No bat. Impact is umpire's call so Stoinis has to walk back. Fell over his stroke slightly Bumrah to Wade, OUT 135 kph, straight to the sweeper cover. Just five off that. A low full toss outside off, Wade gets underneath that but can only slice it away to the man on the sweeper boundary. Wade tried but that's a slightly under-par cameo Bhuvneshwar to Coulter-Nile, OUT misses a full, straight ball. 138 kph, full on off, Coulter-Nile winds up and looks to unfurl a big swing, but fails to connect at all. The off stump is uprooted 4.57pm Australia have continued to struggle in the end overs. All they could muster is 32 runs off the last six overs, substantially below par, even though this surface is slightly two-paced. It seemed, after the start, that Australia set themselves up for 300 again, but yet again, another absolute struggle towards the end overs. Pace off the ball, cutters, the quicker delivery, that's what Australia need, and hope that it can 5.40pm Hello again. In these conditions, 243 might not be an entirely straightforward target to chase, but do Australia have an attack that can exploit this slow, low and grippy pitch? Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane are out in the middle now, as are the Australian players. It's Pat Cummins to bowl the first over. Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs there it is. Finally a short ball gets up to a reasonable height, on or around off stump, and he pulls it away over midwicket and it carries all the way to bring up his 14th ODI hundred. This has been a superb innings in difficult conditions for someone who really relishes the ball coming on to the bat Faulkner to Kohli, 1 wide back of a length, angling down leg, Kohli can't connect with the flick. Faulkner's reviewed umpire Erasmus's not-out decision for caught behind. Interesting. The third umpire's checking for stumping as well. Is there a slight deflection? Can't really tell. Nothing on ultra-edge. And he hasn't lifted his back foot either 9.15pm That's it for this ODI series - this was a good Australian team that got into a lot of good positions, but it ends with India winning 4-1 and sitting on top of the ODI rankings. A lot of good cricket from a lot of players to get them there. The T20 series begins in Ranchi next Saturday. Until then, good night! India won by 7 wickets (with 43 balls remaining) Player of the match is Rohit Sharma, INDIA","India 243 for 3 (Rohit 125, Rahane 61) beat Australia 242 for 9 (Warner 53, Stoinis 46, Axar 3-38) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details India took back their No. 1 ODI ranking by shackling Australia after yet another good start and then chasing down the possibly tricky 243 with apparent ease. India won the series 4-1 - a reversal of the scoreline in the ODIs in Australia early last year - with just one century from their batsmen, that too in the last innings by Rohit Sharma, but a third successive hundred-run opening partnership between Rohit and Ajinkya Rahane. India won the final match on the dry and slow Nagpur track through spin. India's spinners pulled back a bolted horse, conceding 134 for 4 in 30 overs between them; Australia's Adam Zampa released all the pressure exerted by the quicks with the new ball, conceding 48 in six insipid overs before getting Rohit out with a long hop when the match was over for all practical purposes."
"Trent Boult around the wicket That's it from Christchurch tonight. New Zealand far too good. The two teams meet again in Dunedin on Thursday. Hope you can join us then for game two. Goodbye and stay safe. Player of the match is Devon Conway, NZ","New Zealand 184 for 5 (Conway 99*, Phillips 30, J Richardson 2-31) beat Australia 131 (Marsh 45, Sodhi 4-28, Southee 2-10, Boult 2-22) by 53 runs New Zealand utterly humiliated Australia's BBL XI in the opening T20I on the 10th anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake, hammering the tourists by 53 runs at Hagley Oval, the biggest ever margin of victory for them over their rivals across the Tasman in the shortest format of the international game. Devon Conway was calmness and poise personified to maintain his outstanding start to representing New Zealand, compiling an unbeaten 99 to lift his side to 184 for 5 after the Australians had made the swifter start to claim three wickets inside the first four overs. Australia's early success gave way to rather more pedestrian bowling and fielding during the back half of the innings. Chasing at least 20 runs more than they should have been, Aaron Finch's team were never a chance after being left completely bereft by the swinging new ball in the hands of Tim Southee and Trent Boult. Together, they reduced the Australians to 19 for 4, leaving the wrist spinner Ish Sodhi with a mop-up operation that handed him his best figures in T20Is."
"Nehra to Khawaja, OUT and Khawaja is gone. Lovely delivery from Nehra. Khawaja goes without facing a dot. It's the first time he might have got out for under fifty in a long long time. Nehra gets this length ball to hold its line, Khawaja's defensive push is not the greatest, and the outside edge carries to Dhoni. Just the right ball: not dri Bumrah to Watson, (no ball) FOUR runs Bumrah misses his length by six inches, and he has been punished. Low full toss, Watson makes room to drive it between mid-off and extra cover. He has overstepped again Ashwin to Marsh, OUT slower through the air, tempting Marsh, who pays for it. Looks for the big slog sweep, but the ball doesn't quite arrive. He is well early into the shot, and is bowled Yuvraj to Maxwell, OUT and Yuvraj has found a new bunny after KP. First ball Maxwell looks to will a shot over extra cover, but the thing with Yuvraj is, he gives you no pace to work with. Maxwell gets no power behind this shot, and finds the man at extra cover Hardik to Watson, 1 wide wide length ball, but unlike Lynn in game one, Watwon has the presence of mind to not go chasing Yuvraj to Head, SIX runs short square boundary on the leg side, and Head has slog-swept a length ball for six over straight midwicket Hardik to Watson, 1 wide too wide, and this Watson doesn't go for it. He will have to rebowl it Hardik to Watson, 1 wide another big wide outside off. Perhaps a change of plan? Jadeja to Watson, SIX runs low full toss and with a short leg-side boundary for Watson. That is asking to be hit. He has slog-swept this for a six Jadeja to Head, OUT fires in a yorker at 102ks, and squeezes it under Head's bat to knock the middle stump over. Some solace for Jadeja after he was put on a hiding to nothing bowling to a set Watson with the short leg-side boundary Bumrah to Lynn, 1 leg bye quick, into the pads, nearly a yorker, goes just for the leg-bye Bumrah to Lynn, OUT lovely bowling by Bumrah and a lovely catch by Jadeja. Follows Lynn with a full ball as Lynn back away. Lynn manages to scoop it towards cow corner, but Jadeja makes a lot of ground to his right from deep midwicket and takes this with a dive Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide and there is the bad Tait. Wide down the leg side Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide nudges 150ks, but bowls a leg-side wide at 149ks Tait to S Dhawan, 1 wide another wide down the leg side. Looks to cramp him up with a short ball, but goes too far down leg Tait to S Dhawan, SIX runs this is carnage. Gentle length ball on the pads, whipped away for a six Boland to Kohli, 1 wide that is unlucky. Short slower offcutter, but it turns too much from outside off to be called a wide down leg Boyce to Kohli, OUT Kohli is bowled in a roundabout way. Boyce has kept Australia in the contest. This has been a good contest between him and Kohli. Kohli has been charging at Boyce who has still been managing to york him with some dip on his deliveries. This one takes the cue end, hits the pad, ricochets into the stumps Watson to Raina, 1 wide slower bouncer, Raina doesn't play at it, and it is called wide for height. Fairly so. This is well high Surely there are thousands of Twitter jokes about Yuvraj being deleted furiously right now? But boy did he dig himself a hole here? The wheel turned with two gentle length balls at the start of the last over, but to hit them clean out of the crews under such pressure... India have moved from No. 8 at the start of this series to No. 1 after this whi That is the end of a hectic Indian tour of Australia. Those bowlers can rest a bit now. Batsmen have got flat pitches and good bats, but they deserve some of the credit for their ruthlessness too. It was good fun bringing it to you. Cricinfo bids goodbye now India won by 7 wickets Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","India 3 for 200 (Rohit 52, Kohli 50, Raina 49*) beat Australia 5 for 197 (Watson 124*) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A thrilling chase and a cruel missed chance saw India seal a Twenty20 series sweep over Australia at the SCG, as the more settled side was victorious once again. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli laid the groundwork for India's pursuit before Suresh Raina was able to finish things off with the help of Yuvraj Singh, who looked out of touch before finding his timing at precisely the right moment as the pair took 19 off Andrew Tye's final over of the innings to finish off the win. Victory also lifted India to No.1 in the ICC T20 rankings; they were eighth before the series began. Raina was fortunate to be there, having escaped a stumping chance second ball."
"7.10pm Aaron Finch has won the toss, and has decided to bowl. He says if there is going to be any help in the pitch, it is going to be up front. Apart from the three debutants, John Hastings and Glenn Maxwell come in for Australia. Shaun Tait is out Maxwell to S Dhawan, OUT first wicket for Australia. Dhawan tries the reverse-sweep, a shot that is on because the point and third man are inside the circle, but Dhawan has found the man at point. Still doesn't have a fifty in T20 internationals, but a good start for India Tye to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye short of a length, outside off, looking to work this to leg, is beaten and hit on the pad. He is outside the line of off Boland to Kohli, SIX runs that is a mis-hit that has cleared long-off comfortably. A mix of the short straight boundary and quality of bats. Kohli has withdrawn from the stumps and toe-ended this length ball for a six over long-off Ashwin to Marsh, 1 wide wide, too far wide outside off Hardik to Watson, 1 wide short, down the leg side, beats the pull, but will be called a wide Jadeja to Watson, OUT if Yadav's fielding last ball was good, this is nothing short of sensational. Watson has absolutely drilled this right back at the umpire's head. All eyes on the ducking umpire and the boundary but Jadeja gets both his hands in the air and takes this fuss free. It takes a brave man and an excellent fielder. Jadeja is both. Watson is impressed with Jadeja's effort. He is bemused but he is impr Bumrah to Tye, 1 wide tries the short-ball variation... wide down the leg side That's bring an end to what we had to offer for tonight. India men and women have both won their T20 series 2-0. Congratulations India. Thanks for joining us Player of the match is Virat Kohli, INDIA","India 3 for 184 (Rohit 60, Kohli 59) beat Australia 8 for 157 (Finch 74, Jadeja 2-32, Bumrah 2-37) by 27 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 5:00 Agarkar: India's top three the best in T20 cricket India's first series victory of any kind in Australia since the summer of Monkeygate is proving an unmitigated disaster for the hosts, who now face real uncertainty over their captaincy. Aaron Finch twanged a hamstring as his side fell apart under the pressure of a chase for the second time in as many matches. The game evolved in a near action replay of the opening match in Adelaide, as Australia were unable to capitalise on a strong start by Finch and Shaun Marsh in pursuit of a strong Indian total built upon the batting of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Steven Smith and David Warner are set to fly to New Zealand on Saturday, leaving a considerable leadership vacuum should Finch be unfit for the third T20 in Sydney on Sunday. His likely absence may at least mean an opportunity for Usman Khawaja, the outstanding batsman of the summer so far."
"Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide full and wide at 148ks, Sharma's drive is beaten by the outswing Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide short and wide, very wide, called a wide Watson to Rohit Sharma, OUT Welcome back Watto. He is celebrating again. He got a big wicket for Sydney Thunder in the BBL final not long ago, and he has got the big one. Sharma, who had nine lives, doesn't get another. The slower offcutter has been driven straight down the lap of mid-on Tait to Kohli, 1 wide line goes wrong again. Wide down the leg side Boyce to Kohli, SIX runs Kohli is not quite to pitch f this legbreak, he has not got this clean out of the screws, but he has backed his bat to send this over long-off. It just about evades that fielder Watson to Raina, 1 wide slower bouncer, 123ks, called wide for height. Has to be touch and go on that Faulkner to Raina, SIX runs Raina targets the short square boundary, and he has absolutely smashed this. Slower ball, on a length, and he has slogged this right out of the screws Tait to Raina, 1 wide Raina moves inside the line anticipating the bouncer. Tait bowls one but well down the leg side Tait to Raina, 1 wide Raina moves inside the line again, Tait bounces him down the leg side. Another wide Faulkner to Raina, OUT Raina moves too far across and is bowled by a straight full toss. He has premeditated the ramp, but as he is bringing his bat across it hits the ground and gets a bit stuck there. Too late on the ball then Nehra to Finch, 1 leg bye appeal for lbw but this is pitched outside leg and beats Finch's attempt to work it to leg Bumrah to Warner, OUT Bumrah has the wicket. He has clearly looked like India's most impressive bowler. Just difficult to read his pace with that unorthodox action. Warner sees a short ball, looks for the pull, but it hurries on to him, and he drags it from outside off and is caught at mid Hardik to Smith, 1 wide starts with a wide down the leg side Hardik to Finch, 1 wide wide down the leg side again. Short of a length and headed down. Bowled at 136ks Ashwin to Finch, OUT the umpire didn't get to watch the previous delivery so Finch gives him an action replay sans the inside edge. He moves well across the stumps to try to sweep an offbreak, and is beaten again. Pitches within, straightens to hit middle. Dead plumb. Not so sure about the Jadeja to Head, OUT Jadeja has got another wicket. India have Australia where they want them. Like rabbits in headlights against spin. Head has not got a loose ball so far and tries to manufacture a sweep. Misses. Looks pretty dead. The umpire has no hesitation. Replays show impact is out Ashwin to Watson, OUT Nehra takes the nervous catch. India must think they are home and dry. Watson, under pressure, goes for the big sweep, and Ashwin's bounce takes the top edge. It is a skier, and Nehra somehow manages to never look comfortable under those. At short fine leg, he makes Hardik to Lynn, OUT Pandya has his wicket. The wide line has worked. This is another wide he has ruined. Second time in this over he has gone and played a delivery that would have been called a wide. The last time he nearly got caught at deep cover, this time he finds extra cover. Yuvraj So that brings an end to our coverage of the first Twenty20 international of the series. India's women and men both won on their Republic Day. We will be back again with the second game on Friday Player of the match is Virat Kohli, INDIA","The maiden over Maiden as in first. Definitely not as in free of runs. Debutant Hardik Pandya was waiting for his first over, and then he was waiting for his first over to end. The eighth of India's innings and the first of Pandya's career began with three consecutive wides down leg side as Steven Smith walked inside the line, and two more followed later in the over. It meant the over lasted 11 deliveries, and given that a six and a four came off two of the legal balls, he finished with figures of 1-0-19-0 and five wides."
"R Dhawan to Marsh, 3 wide starts the spell with a full ball slanted down leg. Misses the flick and Dhoni can't collect, the ball deflects away into the fine leg region Sharma to Warner, OUT gone! That was the slower ball, back of a length on off stump, and Warner backs away to manufacture room to cut. No pace on it, and the sliced uppercut drops towards backward point, where Jadeja takes a simple catch while falling to his right Bumrah to Marsh, SIX runs short, angling into off stump, and Marsh absolutely loves it there. Plants his front foot forward and pulls fiercely over the midwicket boundary Bumrah to Wade, 1 leg bye sees him coming down the pitch and follows with a full ball at his feet. Jams down and can't get bat to it, but it hits his foot and rolls away to the right of the keeper Yadav to Wade, OUT got him. That's a fullish ball slanting away wide of off stump. Wade looked to thrash his arms through it, having taken a big step back to shorten the length, and only succeeds in top-edging to Dhoni Bumrah to Faulkner, OUT oh, Bumrah, what a delivery. Takes out Faulkner's off stump with a perfect yorker that the batsman plays all around Hastings to Rohit Sharma, OUT back of a length outside off, a bit of extra bounce, and Rohit goes for 99! It hurried through quicker than he expected, perhaps, as he looked to dab it towards third man, and he looks distraught when the caught behind appeal is upheld. Snicko shows the faintest of nicks, though. Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 leg bye in the blockhole and Dhoni misses the flick. Hits him low on the pad, and ricochets into the off side. Huge appeal, but it isn't given. Pitched maybe just outside leg. Marginal Marsh to Pandey, 1 wide takes guard on off stump this time and Marsh looks to bowl it even wider, full and wide. This time it's adjudged wide as Pandey reaches out and fails to connect Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 leg bye full, down the leg side. Dhoni misses the flick and it deflects off the pad to the diving Wade, who appeals for caught behind. Good early call from Pandey to sneak a leg bye Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 leg bye sees him making room and follows him. Slogs at it, misses, and it ricochets off the pad into the off side 10.12pm This is the first successful 300-plus chase against Australia in Australia. India will feel they should have crossed off that achievement in the previous game itself, but they've done it here, and they've done it with six wickets in hand. Superb innings from Pandey, came in when India had lost a bit of impetus with the quick wickets o 10.30pm Phew. What a game to end this ODI series. We'll soon have reports and analysis of everything that happened up on our site. Do take a look when they go up. The T20 series begins on Tuesday - make sure you tune in for that as well. Until then, goodbye! India won by 6 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Manish Pandey, INDIA","India 4 for 331 (Pandey 104*, Rohit 99, Dhawan 78, Hastings 3-61) beat Australia 7 for 330 (Warner 122, Mitchell Marsh 102*, Bumrah 2-40, Ishant 2-60) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:58 Chappell: Hundred will give Pandey more belief Manish Pandey and MS Dhoni, rising star and fading force, combined to deliver India victory over Australia at the last possible opportunity in another run-fest at the SCG. Having crumpled in a humiliating heap in Canberra, the tourists were able to hold their nerve this time, helped by a pair of critical Australian dropped catches. David Warner and Mitchell Marsh had made centuries for Australia, but the allrounder conceded 13 from the final over of the night to allow the visitors avoid the ignominy of a 5-0 series sweep. It also provided partial vindication of Dhoni's longtime belief in seeing out an innings, even if his steady 34 was a diminished version of supreme closing displays he used to be able to put together for his team. Australia were denied an unbeaten home summer."
"R Dhawan to Warner, 1 wide very wide outside off, Warner tries his best to reach it but he can't. Wide Jadeja to Warner, 1 wide and again, Warner backs away but Jadeja fires it down leg Sharma to Finch, 1 wide he's lucky to get away with a wide there, it was full and down leg side, Finch tried to glance again but could not connect Sharma to Warner, OUT bowled him! Warner mows across the line but the length is not short enough as the ball angles across him, he inside edges it on to middle stump. Finally some respite for India ... Warner returns to the team with an innings that has set Australia up for a huge score Bhuvneshwar to Smith, SIX runs six. Just clears the deep square leg fielder. Dhawan at the boundary was lurking and felt like he was in it but the ball lobbed over. Fuller length on middle and Smith just short arm-jabbed that with the wrists Sharma to Smith, SIX runs massive. Just humongous. Right in the slot from Ishant, full outside off. Smith just launches the swipe way over midwicket. Went deep into the first tier. So easily done. Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, 1 leg bye back of a length down leg, hits Marsh on the stomach as he misses his pull Sharma to Maxwell, 1 wide drifts down leg, wide Sharma to Smith, OUT taken. Very good catch from Gurkeerat at fine leg. A nothing delivery on middle stump, Smith goes for the heave but gets a top edge which flies to fine leg. Goes very high in the air and hangs there for quite a while. Mann backtracks, comes forward, backtracks and takes it Yadav to Faulkner, OUT 'Finisher Faulkner' goes for a golden globe. Nice slower delivery on middle, Faulkner gets down to try and sweep but the ball keeps a touch low and sneaks through to rattle into the stumps. Yadav to Wade, 2 leg byes down leg, pings off Wade's pads towards fine leg. Wade scampers back for the second. Makes it with a full-length dive. Out with a direct hit Sharma to Maxwell, OUT what a catch from Pandey to finish. Just a sensational catch. Length on middle, Maxi pulls but doesn't get all if it again, his feet is parallel to the ground as he flies for the take. Great grab. But Maxwell has played a blinder Hastings to S Dhawan, SIX runs wow. What was that. Dhawan at his very confident best. Shortish outside off, Dhawan runs down and swats the ball over point, both feet off the ground while playing the stroke, and that is six. Unbelievable stuff. Maxwell to Kohli, 1 wide flat down leg. Wide Marsh to Kohli, 1 wide strays down leg side again for the second wide in the over Faulkner to Kohli, SIX runs that is massive. What a huge six from Kohli. Comes down to the pitch and wallops the ball, deep over long-on. Has a look at Faulkner immediately. Wow, that is some hit, 103-metre hit 10.10pm This has been some match. This has been some turnaround from Australia. Australia go 4-0 up and extend their home streak to 18 ODIs. But that will not be the story of the day. India were cruising the chase with such ease that it looked like Australia had almost given up before Dhawan had cut a ball to Bailey at point. Ever since, it was all Australia. India failed to win an over as they stumbled and staggered to an unbelievabl Player of the match is Kane Richardson, AUS","Australia 8 for 348 (Finch 107, Warner 93, Smith 51, Ishant 4-77) beat India 323 (Dhawan 126, Kohli 106, Richardson 5-68) by 25 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 4:58 Agarkar: India relying heavily on top three In turn imperious then inept, India tripped over in sight of the finish line at Manuka Oval to gift Australia a fourth victory from as many matches. John Hastings and Kane Richardson were the architects of a staggering passage of implosion by the visitors - losing 9 for 46 after centuries from Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan had taken India to a mere 72 runs shy of victory with 75 balls remaining. Hastings and Richardson claimed a combined 5 for 17 from 27 balls to ensure the afternoon work of Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith and Glenn Maxwell was not wasted, on a Manuka surface the Australian captain had hoped would become more difficult to bat on under lights. For a time Smith was facing Australia's first defeat of the summer and an end to their record streak of ODI wins, but he marshalled his men grandly as India self-destructed. Their loss maintained another proud record for the hosts - never have Australia failed to defend a tally of greater than 300 on home soil."
"Boland to S Dhawan, FOUR runs short on the hips, Dhawan does not connect with the pull properly. He gets a bottom edge, and that's enough for a four, fine on the leg side, the first boundary since the 12th over. Just six boundaries overall in 18 overs Hastings to S Dhawan, OUT Hastings bowls Dhawan and lets out a roar! Full and Dhawan shuffles across off. He wants to pick it up and lift it away over square leg. No dice. Hastings nails the leg stump. Hastings has reward for hitting the deck hard and tying down India Maxwell to Kohli, 1 leg bye darted into the leg stump, hits the pad and rolls behind square Boland to Rahane, 1 leg bye short and on the hips, deflected square on the leg side Boland to Rahane, 1 leg bye full ball, Rahane can't pick it up over midwicket, takes it on the thigh pad as the ball rolls on the pitch. Kohli scampers across for a single Faulkner to Gurkeerat, OUT Gurkeerat undone by the slower ball. This is a Faulkner special, comes from the back of the hand, Gurkeerat does not spot it. He is early into the slog and drags it back onto the leg stump off a thick inside edge. Two slower balls. Two wickets in two overs Hastings to Dhoni, OUT four, six, and out! Dhoni spanks it, Maxi takes it, he feels the heat. Wrings his hands. Dhoni danced out again, Hastings banged it onto the middle of the pitch at 140ks. Pulled to deep midwicket, where Maxi hangs onto the catch Faulkner to Jadeja, 2 wide slash and a miss outside off, wide called. I suspect that was the slower one. Wade fumbles Kohli: I love to bat with Rahane. MS was charged up today. He wanted to smack a few today. On a slowish wicket, he has done a tremendous job. The guys are excited to make it 2-1. It is not an easier track to bat on. 6:30pm Players are making their way out. Will MS try something different and hand the new ball to Umesh? Will he hold Sran back as the first change bowler. We'll find out very soon. Yadav to Finch, OUT a wicket finally. The outside edge has been found courtesy some late movement. Good length, drew him forward, Finch went for the drive, but the foot was nowhere to the pitch of the ball, gets a thin edge which MS accepts gleefully. The manner in which he threw the ball up after pouching that had relief written all over it. He doesn't generally get very Jadeja to Bailey, OUT beautifully bowled. Ball drifts back in, rips off the surface, turns square, ball zips past Bailey's half-hearted prod, his back foot was in the air as Dhoni collected it cleanly and whipped the bails off in a split second. He made it look so easy. His back foot was on the line. That will definitely even the scales once again. Dhoni knew immediately Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 wide round-arm action again, this one's sliding down leg, excellent take by Dhoni Sharma to Marsh, OUT huge roar from Ishant, and that tells you how much it means to him! Coming back to the delivery, it was a length ball that was angling across, good seam position, the ball held its line, Marsh nibbled at that one without any conviction, got a thin edge, straightforward catch for MS Dhoni. India back into this big time Jadeja to Faulkner, 1 leg bye deflects off the pad, but there is short fine leg Thanks for joining us. Hope you enjoyed the coverage. Until next time, it's goodbye from the commentary desk. Cheers! Australia won by 3 wickets (with 7 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 7 for 296 (Maxwell 96, S Marsh 62) beat India 6 for 295 (Kohli 117, S Dhawan 68, Rahane 50, Hastings 4-58) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details In Perth 309 was insufficient, and in Brisbane 308 was inadequate. But for a short while it looked like India's 295 in Melbourne might have been enough to keep this series alive. That was until Glenn Maxwell took it upon himself to bat India out of the match, his 96 steering Australia to a third successive record chase to seal the five-match one-day series with two to play. Though Maxwell fell with one run still required, James Faulkner finished the deal with seven balls to spare. In the past week, Australia have now set new records for successful ODI pursuits at the WACA, the Gabba, and the MCG."
"Hastings to Kohli, 1 wide 117 kph, very wide outside off. Kohli misses his cut and wide called Kane Richardson to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide drifts down leg, wide Boland to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide slower ball, trying to follow a backing-away Rohit who comes inside the line, wide Faulkner to Rahane, OUT Rohit is gone. What a sad way to go, but that is the luck of the draw. He isn't very happy. Rahane drives a slower delivery back at Faulkner who gets a bit of his hand on it, to deflect the ball onto the leg stump. End of a splendid innings from Rohit. Boland to Rahane, 1 wide another extra. Short offcutter down leg Boland to Dhoni, OUT gone. Dhoni's iffy innings ends. Slower ball, but in the slot. Dhoni belts it with a lot of power but straight down the throat of long-on. Maxwell settles under it and takes a sitter. India stuttering again Faulkner to Rahane, OUT gone. Steven Smith takes the catch as Rahane falls. Back of the hand legcutter on off, Rahane comes down and swipes it in the air but the ball hangs in the air for a long time. He did not get enough distance and Smith settles under it at deep midwicket to swallow the catch Faulkner to Pandey, OUT another one goes. Pandey this time. Length delivery on middle, Pandey wanted to go through midwicket but the legcutter stopped in the wicket a touch to take the top edge of Pandey, the ball carries to long-off who takes another easy one Hastings to Ashwin, OUT gone. Ashwin goes now. Full delivery on off, Ashwin walks across to ramp to fine leg but the ball deviates away only to take the top edge, the ball spoons up for short third man to take. Yadav to Finch, 1 leg bye tickled away to fine leg, no bat though Yadav to Marsh, 1 wide 141kph, that's been India's problem. They haven't been able to concentrate enough balls on one side of the wicket. This one is short and slips down leg. Marsh goes for the swivel pull and misses. Jadeja to Finch, OUT that's the Test world-record holder! Rahane has pulled off a blinder at long-off! This was another that Finch thought he could smoke over extra, and so he did. Except this time he had hit it in the air and gave that fielder a chance. Rahane moves swiftly to his left, eyes on the ball all the way, dives forward and grabs the ball inche Sharma to Smith, 1 wide banged in short, Smith steps inside the line to pull it away fine, not able to do so. Sharma to Marsh, OUT hurries him, leading edge, taken by Kohli! That's the bowling leader India want, the man who can dismiss the set batsman. Marsh had set up for the clip through midwicket, but the shortish ball holds on the pitch and comes up with a bit too much height on it. He can't control the shot, he has lost his balance, he pops a high catch to s Yadav to Smith, OUT zips through and topples off! There's the danger of showing off your stumps to a fast bowler. He had hit a cut shot off a delivery on middle against Ashwin, tried to repeat that against Yadav, who bowls it on a good length and gets the ball to skid through to beat his self-inflicted and limited defences ""It's always disappointing. At the end of the day, no matter how much you score. I love playing here. The wickets are good, you always get value for your shots and that's what I want to do. Once I'm in, I feel good enough to score big. Overall pleased with my form, but disappointing not to win. Looking forward to Melbourne now"" So we have an India captain admitting 300 is not enough with their bowling. We have an Australian captain who is batting like he can't get out against India. And a 300-plus total gunned down with the greatest of ease. Basically a repeat of the first ODI, so people tuning in for Melbourne in a few days' time, better make sure you like deja vu. Until then, this is Australia won by 7 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) Player of the match is Rohit Sharma, INDIA","Australia 3 for 309 (Bailey 76*, Marsh 71, Finch 71) beat India 8 for 308 (Rohit 124, Rahane 89, Kohli 59) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 4:00 Chappell: India's bowling far too wayward In the first ODI in Perth, India batted first, Rohit Sharma scored a century, and Australia were set 310 for victory. In the second ODI in Brisbane, India batted first, Rohit Sharma scored a century, and Australia were set 309 for victory. In Perth, Australia won with four balls to spare. In Brisbane, Australia won with six balls to spare. In both cases, and both chases, George Bailey was key."
"Maxwell to Kohli, 1 wide fired down leg as Maxi beats Kohli's sweep. Wide Boland to Kohli, SIX runs dug in short and down the leg side, Kohli swivels and pulls it over long leg. He gets to his first fifty in ODIs v Australia in Australia Boland to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs he bowls yorkers to Dhoni and misses them against Rohit, another low full toss, Rohit gets under it again and lofts it cleanly over wide long on Faulkner to Dhoni, OUT this is a superb catch from the debutant! Dhoni rocked back to the short ball and pulled hard, hitting the ball out of the middle. The ball was flying quickly to Boland's right and was nearly past him when he stuck out his right hand and grabbed it Jadeja to Smith, 1 run played off the back foot behind point, six singles off that over Ashwin to Bailey, 1 leg bye worked off the pads towards short fine leg Yadav to Smith, 1 leg bye tries to heave a length ball across the line and misses and gets hit on the thigh, are Australia making their acceleration now? Barinder Sran to Smith, 1 wide bouncer outside off, slower loopy one. Smith drops his hands on it. Wide Yadav to Smith, 1 leg bye back of a length and may have been just a shade outside off, Smith hops and is smacked on the thigh India's bowlers had fared well in the early exchanges before fading away in the face of the Bailey-Smith double-century stand. Sran showed off his range with some floaty bouncers, back-of-the-hand slower balls, but Ashwin and Jadeja lacked penetration. Australia won by 5 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 5 for 310 (Smith 149, Bailey 112, Sran 3-55) beat India 3 for 309 (Rohit 171*, Kohli 91, Faulkner 2-60) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 6:18 Agarkar: India didn't attack enough to defend 309 If this is summer's main course, then Steven Smith and George Bailey wasted no time at all tucking in. A batsmen's battle unfolded between Australia and India at the WACA, with the hosts seeing a 207-run stand between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli before raising it through the match-defining union between Smith and Bailey, worth 242. Things could have been very different had Bailey been given out caught behind when, sporting a new closed batting stance, he swivelled to pull the debutant Barinder Sran and gloved to MS Dhoni in the fifth over. India's appeal was not altogether convincing, Richard Kettleborough gave the benefit of the doubt, and as Bailey said afterwards: ""Would've been interesting to see on DRS, but we're not the team that doesn't want it."" Already the series has some spice."
"Toss, 7.00 pm MS Dhoni tosses the coin. Steven Smith calls tails and wins. Australia will bat first. He says he thinks the pitch might slow up later in the day, but he isn't sure. It is the same pitch that was used for the women's game between India and West Indies earlier today. Ashwin to Finch, SIX runs massive! Finch moves outside leg and comes forward to slam a full ball far over the long-on boundary, that was hit beautifully Ashwin to Finch, SIX runs this one isn't as beautiful but it's good enough to beat the leaping fielder on the edge of the long-on boundary! Finch gave it everything again, but did not connect as well as the previous one Ashwin to Finch, 5 wide that is so wide outside leg stump, Dhoni has no chance, and short fine leg can't stop it either! Five extras to the total Ashwin to Finch, 1 wide what is with this line? Extremely wide down leg again, this time Dhoni was wise enough to move early Nehra to Khawaja, OUT caught behind and the crowd roars for the first time in this game! Khawaja drove hard at a good length ball that shaped away from him from around off stump and got a thick edge through to Dhoni. India have their first wicket. That ball flew rapidly to the keeper. Ashwin to Warner, OUT stumped! Warner skipped down the track but could not get to the pitch of the delivery, perhaps he came forward too early and Ashwin shortened his length and slowed the pace down too. The ball spun away from the left-hander and beat Warner's helpless prod. Dhoni did the rest Yuvraj to Smith, OUT and he has struck first ball!!! An incredible turn of events. That is his first ball of the tournament. He fired it in quick from around the wicket and got the ball to bounce a bit away from the right-hander, Smith stayed back and wafted at the ball. Dhoni went up rightaway, but Smith looked unhappy. I'll wait for replays to Hardik to Finch, OUT short again, pulls again and this Pandya wins the contest! Finch seemed to be hurried for time as he swung across the line and mis-timed it to Dhawan at deep midwicket, that was taken well inside the boundary Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT bowled him with the slower ball! Maxwell heaved across the line so, so early that he was almost through the shot before the ball arrived. He had backed away towards leg to make a bit of room too. Bumrah clipped the top of off stump. Jadeja to Watson, 1 wide bowled down leg side again to concede another wide, Watson misses the slog sweep Hardik to Faulkner, OUT caught at long on! It's a good length ball that does not come on to the bat, Faulkner makes room and slogs, but mis-times the ball straight to Kohli in the deep. Will Australia get to 150? Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, OUT caught at short fine leg! Coulter-Nile bangs in the heavy bouncer, it rises at pace on Dhawan who hooks but top edges into the air behind the keeper and to short fine leg's left. Khawaja takes a while to settle under the ball but holds the catch safely in the end Faulkner to Kohli, SIX runs they go berserk as the ball sails over the wide long-off boundary! Kohli steps out of his crease and lofts the short of a length ball through the line, it didn't look like he timed that perfectly but the ball carries over the boundary rider 10.58 pm They are still chanting his name in the stands, I can hear fireworks go off outside my window. India are in the semi-finals and will play West Indies, the only team from the subcontinent to make it to the final four. And it is all thanks to Kohli. Did Smith make a mistake giving Kohli the chase? He is a surreal performer when faced with a tar India won by 6 wickets (with 5 balls remaining) Player of the match is Virat Kohli, INDIA","India 161 for 4 (Kohli 82*, Watson 2-23) beat Australia 160 for 6 (Finch 43, Pandya 2-36) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Is there a finer chaser in world cricket than Virat Kohli? MS Dhoni perhaps? It was a good thing for India the two of them were together in the dying stages of their quasi quarter-final against Australia in Mohali. Dhoni's men progressed to a semi-final, against West Indies, and ended Australia's World T20 campaign, and the international career of Shane Watson, with a chase of impeccable timing led by Kohli. Set 161 for victory, India saw their required run-rate balloon up past 10 an over, up towards 12 an over, but Kohli was always poised to prick the balloon. He did so with such perfect timing - 19 runs coming off the 18th over from James Faulkner and then 16 off the next from Nathan Coulter-Nile - that you felt he never doubted himself. In the end, India got home with five balls to spare, madness when you consider they needed 47 off 24."
"Toss, 2.30pm: Afridi and Smith walk out. Australia win the toss and choose to bat, in Mohali. Wahab Riaz to Khawaja, OUT Wahab has Khawaja now. He lets out a roar. Khawaja steps away outside leg to crash this through the covers. But this was a full missile. Khawaja can't make contact. Thde left-arm quick pings the middle stump. It gets tilted back Wahab Riaz to Warner, OUT Wahab nails the stumps again, hits the top of middle. Warner is gone now. 148.1ks dynamite! Back of a length and ducks back in, Warner, who had aimed to make swinging room and open up the off side, is caught in an awkward tangle. W Imad Wasim to Finch, OUT The arm-ball does the trick. Australia's top-three batsmen have all been bowled. This rushes on off the surface, snakes in, keeps low. Beats Finch's defences and raps middle Sami to Smith, 1 wide and his radar is wonky. Sends one down the leg side Imad Wasim to Maxwell, OUT Maxi holes out to long-on now. Pushed through flat, Maxi slogs, and miscues it to Shehzad, who completes a good overhead catch Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 leg bye slower bouncer outside off, dupes Smith and beats the pull. He is hit on the body, as the ball rolls in front of cover. They pinch one Hazlewood to Sharjeel, 1 wide this is too wide outside off, Sharjeel is crease bound as he chases and does not make contact Hazlewood to Shehzad, OUT Shehzad swings now, top-edges it into the hands of NCN at mid-off, just behind the bowler. Head-high clasp Back of a length and angled in around off, Shehzad targets the leg side with an ambitious slog and makes a mess of it. He en Faulkner to Sharjeel, OUT Sharjeel's joyride is over! Again not all that short, but Sharjeel is tempted into that big pull. He goes hard and can only drag it on to his leg stump off a thickish inside edge. And the required rate has shot to 10.62 Faulkner to Khalid Latif, 1 bye Faulkner pulls pace off this outside off and beats the batsman, they pinch a bye Zampa to Umar Akmal, OUT bowled'em. Zampa gives this plenty of air, it dips and hits the stumps. Umar drops to one knee for a slog sweep, but does not make contact. Nice change up in pace and flight, the middle stump is pushed back Zampa to Afridi, OUT Six and out, sums up Afridi! He ventures down the track again. The legspinner retorts. He darts it flatter and wider outside off. Turns away with bounce. Afridi can't reach and connect. Nevill does the rest. Is that Afridi's final inni Coulter-Nile to Malik, SIX runs full length on middle, misses the yorker. Lifted straight down the ground for six Faulkner to Sarfaraz, OUT Faulkner gets his fourth! Sarfraz attempts a reverse sweep against a back of the hand slower ball. He can only spoon a catch to backward point (or square leg if you'd like? Faulkner to Wahab Riaz, OUT Make that a five-for, the first in this tournament! Afridi can't watch this in the dug out. He has his head down with his eyes closed. Wahab swings and sends a top edge to short third man Sharjeel hurtled off the blocks quickly, Latif and Malik made contrasting forties. But Zampa and Faulkner handed the knockout blow. Pakistan were never really in control of the asking rate throughout the chase of 194. There was no Afridi miracle. They ultimately Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS","Australia 193 for 4 (Smith 61*, Watson 44*, Wasim 2-31) beat Pakistan 172 for 8 (Latif 46, Malik 40, Faulkner 5-27) by 21 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia have arrived as a force at the World Twenty20, just in time to wave goodbye to Pakistan, as they completed a 21-run win in Mohali. A storming display with the bat was followed by an improved showing with the ball, setting up what will be effectively an elimination match against India in the final match of the Super 10s on Sunday. The captain Steven Smith chose Mohali as the venue where he found his rhythm, in turn modulated then audacious in an innings that controlled the tempo of a strong total. He was helped in large part by Shane Watson, who batted with the air of a man freed of tension by his retirement announcement on match eve. Together, their stand left Pakistan with a total too steep despite friendly batting conditions."
"Watson to Soumya, OUT they can hardly believe it! Soumya has reached out to what could conceivably have been a wide and cut it straight to point. A bemused Watson walks over to celebrate with his team-mates, still wondering how such tripe became wicket-taking. it was short, it was wide, it tested Soumya's reach. He could have left it, or he should have picked the gap because he had all the time to do so. Watson to Sabbir, 1 wide meanders down the leg side, he hasn't adjusted to the right-handed Sabbir. Watson to Sabbir, 1 leg bye swerves into the pads of Sabbir, he tries to flick the ball through midwicket but makes no contact Coulter-Nile to Mithun, 1 leg bye 142 kph, makes the batsman hop off his crease as he bowls back of a length and cramps him on leg stump. Fends it off to fine leg Coulter-Nile to Sabbir, 1 leg bye he looks at home on this pitch with the new ball. A little movement, a little bounce, a little pace. Sabbir is pushed back as he tries a dink towards square leg. Still too slow on the move to get any wood on it Watson to Mithun, 1 wide comes off quite slow off the deck - there's probably been three days since Mithun played his pull - but the ball sneaks past him to the wicketkeeper. Down the leg side thoguh Marsh to Mithun, SIX runs pummeled! He has flat-batted a shortish delivery over wide long-off and the reason he was able to do that was because of the width on it. Superb strike Zampa to Mithun, OUT ah, the legspinner's long hop. The most deceptive thing in his arsenal. It sat up for the pull shot, Mithun nailed it but he picks out the fielder at deep midwicket Zampa to Shuvagata Hom, OUT flipper, pins him! Well done, Zampa. Against a batsman looking to take him on, he sneaks in the faster one on a shortish length. Hom goes on the back foot for the pull, realises its not on and tries to adjust. Couldn't. Hastings to Mahmudullah, SIX runs loads more behind that though! It was short, it allowed the freedom Mahmudllah needed to free the arms and out came the front foot pull and away it was tonked over square leg Zampa to Shakib, OUT beautifully done. Shakib was making room, Zampa drifts it wider. Just a little bit of extra bounce makes the top edge appear and short third man takes care of the rest. Zampa's been switched on tonight. 9.00 pm Bangladesh were going nowhere, perhaps even hurtling in reverse at one stage. But finally Mahmudullah was set out in the middle and his ability to find the gaps has taken the score to a very respectable 156 for 5. His carves through point in the final overs were superb. He opened the face far enough to beat point, but made sure he hit it square enough for third man to be useless. At one point, Australia brought the third Mustafizur to Watson, 1 wide full and angling away far too wide outside off, wided. Not an auspicious return Mustafizur to Khawaja, 1 leg bye leg-stump ball, Khawaja fails to take toll of it, again. He only directs it to short fine leg Sajib to Watson, SIX runs oh, sheer power! He lumbered down the pitch, but he couldn't reach the pitch of the ball though. So he leaned over, reached out with his hands and lofted it miles over midwicket Sajib to Khawaja, 2 wide shaped to come down, so Sajib bowls quick and down leg. Khawaja though has simply bluffed him. He stayed stock still in his crease, collected the wide and Smith realised there was more on offer when the wicketkeeper missed it That is all we've got for you. Relive the match with Dan Brettig's report, which will arrive here in due course. Thank you for joining us and for your comments. We hope you do so tomorrow as well. Australia won by 3 wickets (with 9 balls remaining) Player of the match is Adam Zampa, AUS","Australia 157 for 7 (Khawaja 58, Shakib 3-27) beat Bangladesh 156 for 5 (Mahmudullah 49*, Zampa 3-23) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Flaws in Australia's World T20 campaign remained evident in a scrappy victory to effectively eliminate Bangladesh from the tournament in Bangalore. Adam Zampa and Usman Khawaja produced noteworthy performances at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, but others were less convincing ahead of more demanding meetings with Pakistan and India. Bangladesh never quite seemed confident enough to push through for victory, particularly after the the loss of Taskin Ahmed and Arafat Sunny due to queries over their bowling actions. Mustafizur Rahman bowled beautifully for his captain Mashrafe Mortaza, however, and in doing so delivered another low score for Australia's leader Steven Smith, who seems to be wrestling with his game only a matter of weeks after being thrust into the T20 captaincy ahead of Aaron Finch. Even when Glenn Maxwell had taken Australia to a position where they needed only nine from the final three overs, there seemed a certain lack of poise about the chase."
"Agar to Guptill, SIX runs it's big, it's solid, it's six. Good grief, this Agar experiment has been met with a shake of the head from Smith as Guptil murders him over his head for six more Maxwell to Williamson, OUT Kane's gone! Williamson stepped to leg and tried to smash it for six over the top, but miscues a skier to Agar - Agar! - who takes it comfortably Maxwell to Anderson, OUT Maxwell's done it again! Anderson's down the pitch, tries to clear long-off but Agar is hovering. He's skied this miles, and Agar's in position and takes it comfortably...on his knees, hands in front of his face, as though imploring the ball into his palm Marsh to Munro, OUT got him! Top, top class from Marsh - he's frustrated Munro for an over and an impetuous, angry, ill-advised front-footed pull picks out deep midwicket who clings on Watson to Taylor, 1 wide shame from Watto - slower ball off-cutter but it's down the leg side Watson to Taylor, SIX runs oh hello - that is, at last, a true monster from Taylor as he steps to off and clatters it over midwicket for six! What a hit. What a sound off the bat Watson to Taylor, OUT he's gone for it again but straight to Marsh at midwicket! Clever bowling from Watson there, actually, as he held it back just a touch Faulkner to Ronchi, OUT mistimes this completely, trying to hit over midwicket but finds Maxwell coming in from deep midwicket, who's about as safe a pair of hands as you can find, and he takes a smart, athletic take low by his laces Coulter-Nile to Milne, OUT an ugly heave-ho - think 1990s Devon Malcolm swing-and-a-miss - and it passes through to the keeper, who wings in a throw and demolishes the stumps to end the innings Anderson to begin over the wicket Milne to Maxwell, 1 wide down the leg side for another wide Santner to Marsh, SIX runs monster! Ooh, that is fruity - that really is massive, down the pitch and murdering it over long-off. 101m beauty Santner to Agar, SIX runs Agar dances down the pitch and clatters an 84m over long-on! Top shot That wraps things up here. Don't forget to join us for England v South Africa shortly, and thanks for your company. Player of the match is Mitchell McClenaghan, NZ","New Zealand 142 for 8 (Guptill 39, Elliott 27, Faulkner 2-18) beat Australia 134 for 9 (Khawaja 38, Marsh 24, McClenaghan 3-17) by eight runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details New Zealand's Midas touch at this World Twenty20 continued in Dharamsala, where they took their tournament record to two wins from two matches with an eight-run victory over Australia. Having spun India out in Nagpur, New Zealand made one change to their side, bringing in the fast bowler Mitchell McClenaghan to replace the spinner Nathan McCullum. McClenaghan duly took 3 for 17 and played a significant role in derailing Australia's innings. Australia, by comparison, seemed confused at the selection table. They picked two specialist spinners to complement allrounder Glenn Maxwell but those two men - Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa - bowled only one over each."
"5.30pm South Africa won the toss and will bat Coulter-Nile to de Kock, 1 wide pushed across full and wide outside off, and he doesn't get away with a loosener Coulter-Nile to de Kock, OUT and strikes! Sliced down to third man...full outside off, de Kock swinging with all his power behind it, the face opens and the ball flies in the air towards Hastings at third man who takes a smart, low catch Watson to du Plessis, 1 wide a bouncer, a loopy bouncer, which he allows through to the keeper and gets the wide call Watson to du Plessis, OUT excellent catch at short midwicket! A slower ball, du Plessis is early on his shot, and spoons a catch low into the leg side where Faulkner does well to dive forward Coulter-Nile to Rossouw, OUT uses his feet, it's a back of a length ball, and he carves it down to long-off...his painful stay is over. A dismissal that won't hurt South Africa, really Coulter-Nile to Miller, 1 leg bye full outside leg, Miller misses is swing and is taken on the pad...an appeal for lbw, but pitched outside leg Faulkner to Miller, OUT drives a low full toss to cover on the edge of the circle...useful innings from Miller Steyn to Khawaja, SIX runs that's handsomely dispatched, short of a length on the hip, Khawaja holding his position this time and pulls it upwards over deep backward square Wiese to Watson, 1 wide a bouncer outside off, beats the top edge as Watson pulls but it's called wide on height Tahir to Smith, SIX runs that's high and handsome by Smith, lovely controlled footwork this time and a perfectly straight bat as he strikes through the line Steyn to Warner, 1 leg bye short, at the body as Warner moves outside leg Abbott to Warner, 1 wide a bouncer, Warner is beaten on the pull and it's another wide Australia win by six wickets and take the series 2-1. An impressive comeback from them after the opening game of the series. They have some mighty power in their batting order. Could this be their year at the World T20? For South Africa, it's a little dent to their confidence but they should also tra Australia won by 6 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Hashim Amla, SA","Australia 181 for 4 (Smith 44, Tahir 2-38) beat South Africa 178 for 4 (Amla 97*, Coulter-Nile 2-36) by six wickets Live Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:47 'My goal to have a century in each format' - De Kock Hashim Amla's career-best 97 not out was not enough for South Africa to secure a series victory as Australia squeezed with spin and then attacked the opposition's slower bowlers to claim a 2-1 win in the T20I decider at Newlands. The result means that the same puzzle that has faced South Africa all summer remains unsolved. Their middle-order is still missing some reliability and they have yet to decide who to anoint as their fifth bowler. Australia, on the other hand, have answered some of their own questions. They found an opening combination that worked, their captain contributed a vital innings, and they were successful against spin on a surface that South Africa had asked to resemble a sub-continent strip as far as possible."
"2pm: Australia win the toss and bowl, they have made four changes to their XI. Shane Watson returns to the top of the order, as expected, with Usman Khawaja making way; James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood and Agar all come in, replacing Nathan Coulter-Nile, Andrew Tye and Adam Zampa. South Africa welcome back Steyn in place of Kyle Abbott, while Farhaan B Hastings to de Villiers, SIX runs skips out and WHACK! Down the wicket and flashes across the line, everything coming together smoothly as de Villiers deposits Hastings on to the grass banks at deep midwicket Hastings to de Villiers, OUT bowled him, no doubt this time! De Villiers plays on, there'll be no Wanderers mauling this week... Tight lines from Hastings and de Villiers was trying to force it off the back foot, got a thick inside edge into off stump Hazlewood to de Kock, 1 wide fired down the leg side Hazlewood to de Kock, SIX runs oh my word! That's extraordinary... This time he targets the off side, opens up his body and launches an uppercut over the covers, it sails through the thin Highveld air several metres back into the crowd. Woof! Faulkner to de Kock, OUT bowled him, de Kock is chopped down! Looked like he played around a full toss but Faulkner is happy either way... It was full and straight, he tried to clip to leg and got an inside edge on to his stumps Marsh to Duminy, SIX runs short ball, Duminy latches on to it and carts a pull high and handsome, comfortably beyond the boundary at deep square leg - that's the SA 100 up in style Marsh to Duminy, OUT similar ball, similar shot - but this time he picks out deep midwicket! Duminy hangs his head in frustration, it was a half-tracker there to be hit but he seemed to get it off the toe of the bat and it went straight and true to the man stationed on the fence Agar to Miller, OUT goes for another maximum but finds long-off! The bat skewed in the hands slightly, got under the shot and Maxwell positioned himself safely underneath to give Agar his maiden T20I wicket. Kong has been downed Hastings to du Plessis, 1 leg bye back of a length, worked away off the legs Faulkner to Behardien, OUT hit out or get out... and Behardien is gone! It was a full toss, out the back of the hand, Behardien was at least trying to do some damage but he caught it off the toe of the bat and holed out to deep midwicket Hastings to du Plessis, SIX runs boshed! Hastings misses his length and du Plessis plants another on into the crowd, a mighty swing over cover Hastings to du Plessis, OUT picks out deep midwicket! The fun is over for Faf! Full toss does the job for Hastings, this time du Plessis didn't quite get hold of it and he found the man in the deep Steyn to Smith, 1 leg bye starts with a straight delivery which Smith aims into the leg side, the ball trickles to square leg Morris to Maxwell, 1 wide shoved down the leg side, called wide Tahir to Maxwell, 1 wide he saw Maxwell starting to move and fired this down the leg side Wiese to Maxwell, SIX runs and he gets launched into the stands over long on...Maxwell swings at a full delivery, a slower ball, outside off and even though it comes off close to the bottom of the bat it has the legs Tahir to Warner, SIX runs full toss. Dispatched. Slog sweep. Deep midwicket. Rinse and repeat Morris to Maxwell, 1 wide full, angled down the leg side, it's a wide so the free hit carries over...and the over has gone very pear-shaped Morris to Maxwell, 1 wide now it's wide outside off! Maxwell moving around his crease, Morris trying to out think him but it's too wide Morris to Maxwell, 1 leg bye full, angled into the pads, he doesn't make contact and it's just a leg bye towards midwicket. The tension mounts Rabada to Faulkner, 1 wide swing and a miss! Called wide again! That seems a harsh call. Looked inside the white guideline to me. Actually, on the replay, that was over the white guideline, so fair call from the umpire Australia won by 5 wickets Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 205 for 5 (Warner 77, Maxwell 75) beat South Africa 204 for 7 (du Plessis 79, Faulkner 3-28) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A dramatic final over filled with fumbles in the field saw James Faulkner and Mitchell Marsh take Australia to a first T20 win in six matches and level the series at 1-1 with their highest successful chase. Australia had slipped to 32 for 3 in pursuit of 205 before David Warner and Glenn Maxwell posted a record fourth-wicket partnership of 161 but were both dismissed to set up a thrilling, last-ball finish. Chris Morris had Maxwell caught on the cover boundary with the fifth ball of the penultimate over to leave Kagiso Rabada 11 to defend. Rabada started with a full straight delivery which Warner missed as he cleared the front leg to swing across the line, bowling him off his pad to put South Africa in the pound seat. Then a message came from the dugout, which seemed to instruct Rabada to bowl outside off stump but he went too wide."
"5.30pm Australia have won the toss and will bat Rabada to Khawaja, OUT picks him out! Deep square leg barely had to move...a short ball, Khawaja went for the pull and didn't try to keep it down. A lot of effort for not much reward in that stay. Neat catch by Wiese Wiese to Warner, OUT strikes first ball! Over the wicket, short of a length outside off, and Warner ends up steering this straight to backward point where Duminy takes a good low catch. He went for placement rather than brute force this time Tahir to Finch, OUT would you believe it! Starts with a filthy full toss outside off which Finch plants straight to deep midwicket. The mood is with Tahir in recent weeks Wiese to Smith, OUT and he's edged it! A very tame dismissal. A short delivery which he was trying to guide to third man - another cutter from Wiese, dragged a long way down - and it takes a top edge through to de Kock Morris to Maxwell, OUT huge wicket! Short of a length works again. Maxwell standing on leg stump, tries to give himself room to go over the off side but ends up carving high into the air and du Plessis snaffles the catch just outside the fielding circle Tahir to Nevill, OUT and he has another! Nevill going right back in his crease, the ball appeared to strike in line with leg stump. Will be interesting to see a replay of that one. A typically full-throated appeal from Tahir and to his delight the finger goes up Morris to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye short again, angled into leg stump, not much pace to work with off the pitch as he tries to pull Abbott to Marsh, SIX runs and a full toss outside off is launched high and wide of long on...that's some power from Marsh who gave himself a solid base to strike through the line Tahir to Hastings, OUT that was on the cards...a massive heave at another googly, could have driven a bus between the gap Hastings left as he swung, and the stumps are demolished Rabada to Coulter-Nile, OUT terrific bowling, that's the model of a leg-stump yorker...NCN gives himself some room, can't make contact and Rabada is right on target Abbott to Marsh, OUT short outside off, another cutter, and it gets flat-batted straight to long off where Miller takes the simple catch Coulter-Nile to Miller, 1 wide fired full and wide as Miller set himself to hit over cover - just outside the tramlines Hastings to Miller, SIX runs that's gone! Fully over the stand at deep square leg this time! Miller adjusts his range and attaches a rocket to a full, leg-stump ball from Hastings, sends it fizzing beyond the rope, beyond the stadium, possibly beyond the city limits... and yet it's still only worth six South Africa won by 3 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Miller, SA","South Africa 158 for 7 (Miller 53*, du Plessis 40, Coulter-Nile 3-29) beat Australia 157 for 9 (Finch 40, Tahir 3-21) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details David Miller struck his first international fifty since February last year and his career-best T20I score to guide South Africa to the highest successful chase at Kingsmead and a lead in the three-match series against Australia. Miller's return to form came at an opportune time - South Africa were 95 for 6 in their reply and needed a lower-order surge to ensure their efforts with the ball were not wasted. On a dry, cracked pitch, they pulled Australia back in an innings that was destined for over 200. Imran Tahir led the strangle to pull Australia back from 69 for 1 in the PowerPlay. South Africa took 6 for 45 between the sixth and 16th over and not even Mitchell Marsh's cameo at the end gave Australia enough to defend."
"Pollard to Finch, OUT KP strikes in his first over and nearly does a Tahir, again. He looks towards the stands, perhaps, and does the finger-on-the-lip celebration. The lack of pace does Finch in. Back of a length incutter, comes in from outside off at 115ks, Finch aims to force it from there. This means that he drags a catch to Samuels at deep midwicket Narine to Smith, 1 wide slid down leg, Smith aims to shovel it fine, no dice, wide Gabriel to Marsh, 1 wide width on offer, Marsh shapes to play a square drive but can't reach the delivery, easy call for the umpire Gabriel to Smith, OUT Christmas has come early for Gabriel after what was a horror spell until now. Rang long hop this one - too short - and Smith tries to fetch the pull from outside off when he could have easily looked to cut that behind point, gets a top edge and Marlon Samuels gleefully accepts the dolly at midwicket. Smith knew he was dead the moment he hit that. A hint of extra bounce on this surface also played its part. Gabriel to Maxwell, OUT another one bites the dust. Gabriel didn't celebrate Smith's wicket, but that isn't the case now as he roars in delight. This one's an incoming length ball that nips back in a touch from the off stump, Maxwell misses the line completely and is struck plumb in front of leg stump Possibly a big moment in the match! Narine to Wade, 1 leg bye didn't pick the straighter one that drift back into middle and leg to hit him high on the pad Benn to Marsh, OUT Chopped on! The bails are sent flying. Having gone wicketless on Friday, Benn nips out Marsh. Pushed through quicker, 90.4ks, and turns away from the right hander. He has a lazy waft away from the body after stepping back and chops it onto the stumps via an inside edge. The WI fans are dancing and grooving in the stands Benn to Starc, 1 wide fired down leg, wide Narine to Starc, SIX runs as clean as it can get! Chips down the track, gets to the pitch and swings across the line. Excellent use of the bottom hand to get the elevation, and that flew into the crowd at deep midwicket. Wow Narine to Starc, OUT first wicket for Narine, he has his revenge this time. Nothing wrong with the legality of the delivery. He tosses it up generously, the ball spins away sharply and beats Starc's wild swing. In trying to slog again, Starc was outside the crease as Ramdin collected the ball cleanly and whipped the bails off in a jiffy, with the backfoot a good couple of yards out. Holder to Wade, 1 wide too full, but well down leg. Wade misses a faint tickle, Holder will have to bowl that one again Holder to Coulter-Nile, OUT swung in the air, this goes miles in the air, Bravo settles underneath that at mid-on and takes the skier without much fuss. Coulter-Nile went across the line even as the bat face turned in his hand, which meant there wasn't much power generated behind the stroke. Easy as they come for Bravo Holder to Wade, SIX runs wow, he's hit that superbly. This one was full and angling across, Wade once again went cross-batted across the line, and Wade used his bottom hand to swing across the line and hammer it over deep midwicket Brathwaite to Wade, SIX runs what a hit to finish the innings. Too full, he gets down on one knee, gets underneath the ball and swings that across the line over wide long-on. Super hit! 5.10pm Welcome back, folks. We aren't far away from a resumption. West Indies' top order has struggled. The last time these two sides played, it was Denesh Ramdin and Marlon Samuels who bailed them out. Can they get a better start from the openers tonight? They will have their task cut out against Mitchell Starc first up Starc to Charles, 1 wide floats it full and well outside off, another wide. Starc is looking to cause confusion in the batsman's mind perhaps by floating one across after getting a couple of deliveries in Starc to Fletcher, 1 wide full but well outside off, exercise for the umpire Zampa to Charles, 1 wide dipping full toss outside leg, wide Marsh to Ramdin, (no ball) oversteps in his quest for extra pace, this one's another good bouncer otherwise. Ramdin drops his gloves as he sees that through to the keeper. Free hit coming up Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs flat hit that would have taken the long-on fielder with it. Too short, Pollard rocks back and flat-bats the pull. Coulter-Nile threw himself in the air to take that one-handed but the ball kept travelling Starc to Ramdin, 1 leg bye Starc goes wide of the crease and angles it in, Ramdin gets his front leg across, his head falls over. Ungainly. Pinged on the pad Coulter-Nile to Holder, SIX runs Holder shows some intent. He steps out and belts this length ball over mid-on for a flat six Coulter-Nile to Brathwaite, 2 wide bouncer on the leg stump, Carlos hooks. Wade throws himself to his left and does not catch the ball. Was there a bit of glove, there? Marsh to Ramdin, 1 wide bouncer, sails over Ramdin, wide So a journey that started on June 3, ends three and a half weeks later. Hope you've enjoyed our ball-by-ball coverage. Plenty of cricket coming up in the Caribbean. The CPL kicks off on June 29. West Indies then host India for four Tests starting July 21. Until next time, it's goodbye from all of us here. Cheers! Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 270 for 9 (Wade 57*, Holder 2-51, Gabriel 2-58) beat West Indies 212 (Charles 45, Hazlewood 5-50, Marsh 3-32) by 58 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Having taken Australia into the triangular series final with the bat, Mitchell Marsh ensured a tournament-winning victory over the West Indies by delivering with the ball. Marsh's emergence as a performer under pressure was a major positive of Australia's otherwise workman-like defeat of West Indies and the already vanquished South Africa, making it fitting that he landed the decisive blows against a doughty home side. A spell of 3 for 6 featured the wickets of Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Johnson Charles in successive overs, breaking the back of the West Indies chase and leaving too much for their heavy-hitting lower order to do. Josh Hazlewood followed up with five wickets of his own, the finishing touch arriving with a typically mercurial catch by Glenn Maxwell. Australia also owed much to the wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, who muscled his way to a half-century with the tail that atoned for earlier wasted starts by the top order, while also reaffirming his place in the team."
"Maxwell to Samuels, 1 wide fires one down leg, Wade does well to get across to half-stop that Maxwell to Ramdin, 1 wide bowls a slider down leg, good take by Wade Starc to Ramdin, 1 wide wild full ball down the leg side from round the stumps, wide Starc to Ramdin, OUT Back of a length and veers in, Ramdin aims for a roundhouse swipe across the line and does not connect. Timbaah! Ramdin acknowledges a cheers as he walks back. Starc finally finds a way past this pair. The quick hit the top of middle Boland to Samuels, 1 wide bouncer outside off, left alone, too high. Wide Boland to Brathwaite, OUT great reply from Boland. Pinpoint yorker on off, dips under the bat and tilts the middle stump back. Some more reward for Boland at the death Faulkner to Holder, OUT Holder holes out! Looks like the back of the hand legcutter. Full and outside off. Holder attacks it and ends up slicing it straight into the lap of sweeper cover Faulkner to Samuels, OUT No, he is dismissed off the last ball of WI's innings. What a reception for him! Full and outside off, Samuels swings and ends up slicing a catch to sweeper cover Brathwaite to Finch, OUT uppish and there's the first wicket. Finch is clearly hustled for pace as he hops back to whip it to square leg. He had to fetch the ball from outside off as the extra bounce means the ball lobs off the leading edge to mid-on. Brathwaite is pumped as he leaps in joy to cele Gabriel to Khawaja, OUT first ODI wicket for Gabriel, and it's a peach to get Khawaja. Angles a length ball across after all those deliveries on the pads, and is rewarded immediately. This was bowled at an angle where Khawaja simply had to play, and he made the mistake of playing with an angled bat Narine to Smith, 1 wide breaking down leg, wide Benn to Bailey, OUT soft, soft dismissal! Bailey falls, three balls after the drinks break. Length ball, drifts in on off, grips in the surface, and turns away. Bailey is left searching for a leg-side flick. Instead, he plops a leading edge into the lap of KP at short extra cover Brathwaite to Smith, 1 leg bye shuffles across to whip, but the extra bounce means the ball thuds into the thigh pad, they steal a leg-bye Narine to Smith, 1 wide pushed through quicker, but loses direction. Excellent take down leg Pollard to Smith, 1 wide full cutter down leg, offbreak goes wide Brathwaite to Marsh, 1 leg bye stifled lbw appeal as Marsh looks to work across the line, the ball deflects off the pad to third man. There was appreciable bounce there, and so the ball would have comfortably missed the stumps Gabriel to Marsh, 1 bye pulls and misses, Ramdin half-stops it but ensures the pace is taken off the ball, Ashley Nurse, filling in for Holder, stops that at short fine leg Brathwaite to Maxwell, SIX runs this time he brings out the cross-batted swipe over deep midwicket. This was too full and he picked the bones out of that one. Darren Bravo leaps high to stop that, but can only get his finger tips to that. At no stage was he in control 8.30pm Australia are through to the final, while West Indies v South Africa on Thursday will be a do-or-die clash. This clash was right in the balance when Australia lost their openers, but the Smith-Marsh stand set things up nicely for Glenn Maxwell to redeem himself in some style. All of that reduced a Australia won by 6 wickets (with 8 balls remaining) Player of the match is Marlon Samuels, WI","Australia 283 for 4 (Marsh 79*, Smith 78, Maxwell 46*) beat West Indies 282 for 8 (Samuels 125, Ramdin 91, Starc 3-51) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell provided overdue contributions in the middle order to help Steven Smith guide Australia into the triangular series final with a six-wicket win over the West Indies at Bridgetown in Barbados. Interim coach Justin Langer had been eager to see how his team responded under the pressure of possible tournament elimination, and Marlon Samuels' fine hundred in partnership with Denesh Ramdin ensured Australia's batsmen had little margin for error at Kensington Oval. However, Smith produced the workmanlike innings of a leader and was able to coax Marsh into one of his best and most complete international innings, albeit on a surface that bore closer resemblance to Australian climes than any other in this series. Maxwell then came in with the game still in the balance - Australia needed 62 off 50 balls - and responded with a starburst of shots that will help his own sense of esteem enormously after a series in which he was dropped for two matches. Even so, the Australians will still want to improve their fielding and bowling, two areas that were found wanting in the afternoon."
"Toss Bangladesh win toss, will bat first - there are two changes for Australia. Andrew Tye and Mitchell Swepson are in, in place of Nathan Ellis and Adam Zampa. Hazlewood to Soumya, OUT short of a length, aims across the line to the leg side with a cross-batted swipe and gets a big top edge into the covers Agar to Shakib, 1 wide short of a length and this spins significantly, goes down the leg side and called wide Hazlewood to Shakib, OUT and he gets him! Back of a length, a cutter, Shakib backing away to try and cut, he's cramped for room and gets a top edge Swepson to Mahmudullah, OUT lbw appeal, and given! Full, on off, and this is the wrong'un! Goes for the sweep, misses, hits the front leg. This is crashing into middle. Swepson to Nurul, OUT out first ball? Maybe a bit high. Good length on off and turning in as Nurul goes onto the back foot to defend. Hits the front leg, huge lbw appeal but not given Swepson to Mohammad Naim, OUT enough defending Naim feels. Goes for the slog sweep, but he ends up slicing the shot right up. Wade calls early for the catch, flicks his helmet off, and then takes the catch. This was full, quicker, on off, and Naim was a bit out of position to get that over cow corner Agar to Afif, OUT full on off stump. Down on one knee as he goes for the slog sweep. Well timed, but it's soared straight into the hands of the fielder placed at deep midwicket for that very stroke. Afif will be disappointed falling that way. Wade gives out a chuckle as he high-fives Agar Tye to Shamim Hossain, OUT full, on leg, and it's the slower ball. Wants to work it leg side but pushes at it with hard hands. Pops straight to midwicket who gobbles it up with ease. Smart bowling Tye to Mahedi Hasan, SIX runs three figures! Short ball, not quick. Stays on the back foot, keeps his eyes on the ball, and pulled over deep backward square leg for six Tye to Mahedi Hasan, OUT full, just outside off. Clears the front leg to smack it over cover. Toe-ended, and in the air. Cover gets under it to take a reverse-cup catch Tye to Shoriful Islam, OUT Tye finishes off wicket another wicket Good length on middle, and he goes for a wild heave through the leg side. Through the shot early, in the air, and deep midwicket takes the catch. Bangladesh finish on 104 for 9 As for standout players, Naim's 36-ball 28 doesn't look too bad given Bangladesh finished with only one wicket in hand. Afif's 17-ball 20 deserves a shout out too. Hazlewood excellent to get Soumya and Shakib out, and Swepson really got the ball to zip around. Shakib to McDermott, 1 wide pushed down the leg side Shakib to Christian, SIX runs this is a bit more of a mow, but six more! Stayed in his crease this time and swung through the line over wide long-on Shakib to Christian, SIX runs shorter, flatter, but six more! 30 runs off the over. Five sixes. Christian rocked back and pulled this over deep midwicket Shoriful Islam to Agar, 1 leg bye good length on off and angling into leg. Hits the thigh region, and rolls away. They scamper across for one Nasum to Agar, SIX runs full on off stump. Down on one knee and slapped over deep midwicket! That's all from us at ESPNcricinfo. On behalf of Ranjith P and Andrew McGlashan this is Sreshth Shah signing off. See you for the 5th T20I day after tomorrow. If you want more cricket, England v India is on! Australia won by 3 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Swepson, AUS","Australia 105 for 7 (Christian 39) beat Bangladesh 104 for 9 (Swepson 3-12, Tye 3-18) by three wickets It may not rank particularly high in Australia's sporting achievements today as the Olympics draws to a finish, but the cricketers avoided a series whitewash against Bangladesh with a three-wicket win in a low-scoring scrap on a devilishly tricky surface. The home side made them sweat for it, too, and when the chase subsided to 65 for 6 - with 30 of those runs having come when Dan Christian took Shakib Al Hasan for five sixes in an over - it looked like they could pull off an extraordinary victory. However, Ashton Agar produced a calm and clever innings to take Australia to the brink of the target alongside Ashton Turner. This entire series has been hard work for batters, and this match took it to another level. Bangladesh were set back by the excellent Josh Hazlewood, stumbled against the recalled Mitchell Swepson and only crossed three figures in the final over when Mahedi Hasan struck an enterprising 23 off 16 balls."
"Benn to Smith, SIX runs six more. Slightly short, Smith picks the length early, rocks back and then muscles a pull over midwicket for six. Really good shot, made use of the lengths on both occasions Brathwaite to Smith, OUT taken! Smith goes. Superb bowling previously has led to a wicket for Brathwaite. A legcutter this time, quite full and wide outside off. Smith looks to execute an ugly drag-sweep into the leg side but the ball is top-edged and goes straight in the air. Hangs there for quite awhile, Brathwaite calls, settles himself under it and takes a go Benn to Khawaja, 1 wide slanted full down leg, wide Brathwaite to Bailey, SIX runs another cutter, fuller in length on off, Bailey crouches and wades into it. Smashing it over midwicket. He hit the pants off that Brathwaite to Marsh, OUT low full toss on off, Marsh gives it away. The bat twisted in his hands and he ends up slicing it into the hands of Holder at mid-off Pollard to Head, OUT Head skies this offcutter to the keeper. Ramdin settles under it comfortably. Full and leaves the left-hander outside off. Head winds up for a roundhouse swipe. He watches the top edge lodge in the gloves of Ramdin Holder to Wade, OUT The middle stump is floored. Holder pumps his fist. Wade cleared his front leg and shimmied out for a drill down the ground. This yorker shatters the middle stump. No cameo from Wade. Holder caps his spell with a wicket Pollard to Bailey, OUT Another wicket for KP. He is pumped. Bailey jumps outside leg again. Pollard sends in an offcutter chasing the batsman. He shapes to pull and ends up top-edging it to the short midwicket region. Ramdin with the big gloves calls for the catch and completes it Pollard to Faulkner, 1 wide full and heads down leg, Pollard floated it wider as Faulkner backed away 4.45pm Australia had a bright start with Khawaja and Smith making back-to-back half-centuries. Australia, however, couldn't launch from the platform in the slog overs. They lost 4 for 39 in the last five overs, despite Bailey's blows. Holder generated extra bounce upfront before Brathwaite and Pollard mixed it up with their assortment of cutters. This pitch may not have 5.12pm Welcome to the chase. Could be an interesting one of West Indies get a good start. This should be a proper test of their ability to build patiently. Out come the players. This ball will reverse swing sharply later. Hazlewood has the ball. Coulter-Nile to Fletcher, 1 leg bye phew, that was close. Fullish on off and middle, the ball comes back and Fletcher misses a flick. That looked out to me. Maybe a bit high? Australia don't even consider a review Faulkner to Charles, 1 leg bye drifts down leg, slower ball. Off the pad to fine leg for one Faulkner to Fletcher, OUT gone this time. The slower delivery and Australia have their first. A slow, good-length delivery outside off, the ball stops on Fletcher who checks his stroke. Since he withdraws very late, the ball bobs up off the withdrawing bat and is easily taken by point. Will that spark something? Coulter-Nile to Bravo, 1 wide overly full, overly wide. Left alone and a wide is called. Head to Samuels, 1 wide pitched outside leg and breaks away further. drifting down leg, wide called by ump Brathwaite Coulter-Nile to Ramdin, 1 wide this one has started too straight and gone down leg Zampa to Samuels, SIX runs six more. More flight on off, Samuels runs down and lofts it with the spin, Though he could clear long-ff and he did easily Coulter-Nile to Holder, OUT gone. Holder is given. But he opts for the review. Good length delivery outside off, which jags back in again. Holder attempts a big swing and the ball goes through between bat and pad. Looks like he has missed it, but there is a sound. Not sure what it is. Swerves back in and Wade collects well, diving to his left. Not enough evidence 8.38pm The music is blaring, the crowd is singing, WI players shake hands with each other and joy abounds Basseterre because West Indies have done exceptionally well in their chase to thrash Australia on a tricky surface. Chasing 266, West Indies' openers gave them a lightning start to set up the chase. Significant contributions through the middle order, led by Samuels' West Indies won by 4 wickets (with 26 balls remaining) Player of the match is Marlon Samuels, WI","West Indies 266 for 6 (Samuels 92, Charles 48) beat Australia 265 for 7 (Khawaja 98, Smith 74) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:57 Samuels, openers give West Indies four-wicket win A rollicking opening stand and a Marlon Samuels special lifted West Indies to their second victory of the triangular series over an uncharacteristically sloppy Australian side in St Kitts. From a strong platform of 139 for 1 after 27 overs the visitors' innings lost momentum, and the target of 266 was vulnerable to an early assault on the short boundaries of Warner Park. Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher duly hurled themselves at a bowling attack that was missing Mitchell Starc, and were helped by a pair of dropped catches from Usman Khawaja. Those misses helped take West Indies to an opening stand of 74 inside 10 overs, and that early acceleration allowed Samuels to sculpt an innings in his familiar style - long periods of inactivity mixed with brief bursts of power and inspiration. Darren Bravo and Denesh Ramdin offered support, and a wobble arrived too late to save Australia from defeat."
"12.30pm Australia won the toss and chose to bat Rabada to Warner, SIX runs wow, gone all the way. Shortish on off, Warner pulls. So effortless, so lazy. Made sure he got his pull over square leg and even though he had to drag it from off, it goes well over. Tahir to Finch, OUT gone. Finch persists with the sweep. Flat on off, the quicker delivery. Finch clears a front foot and tries to smash his sweep through square leg but was quite far from the ball. The ball missed his cross-batted swat and clattered into off stump. Tahir sets off in typical fashion. Finch struggled for any fluency in that knock. Duminy to Warner, 1 wide drifting down leg, sweep and a miss, wide Duminy to Khawaja, 1 wide fired fast and down leg, sweep and a miss, wide called by ump Wilson Parnell to Warner, OUT gone! What a start this is for SA after the drinks break. A short delivery on middle is pulled powerfully but straight to midwicket. Comfortable height too. Warner was waiting on that back foot and hit it beautifully, just some indecisiveness whether to go over or keep it down. In the end, did neither. But what an innings that was Phangiso to Khawaja, OUT taken this time! Amla takes it, and Khawaja has to go. Flat on off, Khawaja gets low to sweep and gets another top edge which goes up in the air and is taken at short fine leg. Beautiful bowling, not afraid to give the ball some air even to the left-hander. Australia losing their way Rabada to Wade, 1 wide good short one to end. But a wide called. Shortish outside off, Wade doesn't interfere. The ball is over head height Tahir to Bailey, OUT given! Bailey is gone. Wrong un' from Tahir on middle, strikes Bailey in front. Bailey reviews. That looks pretty adjacent. It has spun a little into Bailey and he did have a significant stride. his only hope is height I guess. No bat. Umpire's call, just clipping leg stump so Bailey has to go. Rabada to Wade, OUT full and straight, given! Yorker on off, Wade sets up for another scoop and misses it. The ball strikes Wade well outside off though, Umpire Joel Wilson gives him out. Shocking decision, struck him well outside the line 4.50pm Australia huffed and puffed to 288, just 103 off the last 15 overs and losing five wickets in that period. After Warner's sixth ODI ton, his first outside Australia, it looked like a score of 310 was on but they lost wickets and played out too many dots, losing plenty of momentum in the process. May seem weird but SA will be happy with this score. Chase in a bit. 5.20pm Thanks, Nikhil. Hello again. Amla and Qdk are out in the middle. The returning Starc is armed with the new ball. Hazlewood to Amla, 1 wide full and slants down leg, wide Starc to de Kock, 1 wide banged in short and wide outside off, too wide. Qdk shaped to cut before bailing out at the last moment Finch to Amla, SIX runs quite an ugly shot by Amla's standards but what a shot that is. Too much flight, Amla clears his front foot and drills the lofted drive over long-off. Sliced it Hazlewood to Duminy, 1 leg bye full on leg stump, JP pre-meditates a sweep and tickles it to short fine leg Starc to Phangiso, OUT Maxi takes a screamer at backward point. Plucks it out of thin air. Angled in full and tails away late outside off at 146ks to mess with the drive. He slices it in the air. Maxi leaps and stretches his right hand over his head. He comes out with the ball in one hand. One-handed stunner! The timing of the jump was impressive Starc to Rabada, 1 leg bye big appeal for lbw, not given by Wilson. Steven Smith challenges the on-field call. Inswinging full toss, raps the back pad in front of leg stump. All three stumps visible. Looked like it was sliding down the leg side. The tracker confirms it Hazlewood to Rabada, 1 leg bye short and shading towards the leg stump, takes the pad and wanders to square leg 8.58pm David Warner set it up with his first ODI century outside Australia, at Warner Park. Amla and the returning du Plessis led SA's chase with fluent half-centuries, before Hazlewood and Zampa triggered a collapse. Starc then burst through the opening and toyed with SA's notoriously long tail. From 210 for 3, they crashed to 252 all out. Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 288 for 6 (Warner 109, Khawaja 59, Smith 52*) beat South Africa 252 (Du Plessis 63, Amla 60, Starc 3-43, Zampa 3-52, Hazlewood 3-52) by 36 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details If there is any venue outside Australia where David Warner should feel at home it is the ground in Basseterre on the island of St Kitts. It is tailor-made for him with its short boundaries and hard surface. It is even named Warner Park. In his first international match at his namesake venue, Warner struck his sixth ODI hundred, and first outside Australia, to set up a 36-run victory over South Africa. Australia thus became the first team to win two games in this tri-series, which has now moved on from the slow, spinning surfaces of Guyana."
"Coulter-Nile to Amla, 1 wide half-volley slipping down leg, Amla can't glance it away. Beaten Hazlewood to Amla, 1 leg bye raps the pad outside the line of off. Amla walks across off aiming for a whip over midwicket and misses Lyon to Rossouw, OUT Rossouw presses forward and has been given out lbw by ump Illingworth. Looks adjacent. No inside snick there. Rossouw reviews. Not a good one. South Africa have lost their review. Another one that straightens, fuller in length, hit in front of middle. He pushed forward Zampa to Amla, 1 wide slipping down leg, errant ball, wide Coulter-Nile to de Villiers, OUT bowled im. Massive wicket. AB is gone. Full on off, tails back in just enough to beat AB's bat. He tried to open the face to guide to third man but the ball jagged back just enough to go through his defences. Huge wicket this. Coulter-Nile to Duminy, OUT bowled im. SA in tatters. NCN again. An absolute beauty. Not much he could have done actually. A good length delivery on off, straightens just enough to beat Duminy's bat. Uproots off stump. NCN defeated AB with one that jagged back in, beats Duminy with the aw Hazlewood to Parnell, OUT got im. One more. Another batsman's off stump goes for a jolly walk. Kept very low. Full on off, Parnell presses forward to that and planted his bat down the line but the ball pitched and kept low enough to creep under the bat. Clattered into off stump. SA six do Zampa to Phangiso, OUT Phangiso goes for another wild heave. He makes a mess of it and holes out to long-off. Tosses a legbreak. The batsman goes low for a slog-sweep. He skews it into the hands of Hazlewood. FB shakes his head at the non-striker's end Zampa to Behardien, 1 wide spinning down leg, wide Zampa to Behardien, SIX runs half-tracker on off, FB winds up and pulls it with authority over midwicket for six. It kept low but FB found the sweet spot on the bat. That strike raises his half-century Maxwell to Behardien, OUT bowled'em. End of a fighting innings from FB. Tossed full and straight, FB bends for a reverse paddle. He misses and is nutmegged. Timbaaaah! Parnell to Warner, OUT got im. Big wicket. Parnell gets the big fish. He isn't bothering with the review. Huge breakthrough. Fullish on middle and leg, the ball jags back and hits Warner flush in front of leg. Umpire's call was the likely outcome, if Warner reviewed. Rabada to Khawaja, OUT bowled im. Another big wicket. Khawaja is beaten and SA have struck. Overpitched on off and middle, hustles Khawaja for pace who gets his angled bat down too late. The ball clips the pads and then clatters into the stumps Parnell to Smith, OUT another wicket. Huge one again. But Smith reviews. Fullish on off, Smith shuffled across and missed a flick. The ball strikes him right in front of middle and leg. Looks out. No bat either. Australia in big trouble now. All reds and Smith is gone. Phangiso to Finch, SIX runs wow, what timing. flight on off, Finch opens up the bat face and lifts it with the spin over cover. Fantastic shot Shamsi to Maxwell, OUT given this time. This one did not look out. But Umpire Joel Wilson gives him. Flat legbreak is sliding down leg, but Shamsi and co. don't care. He has a wicket in his first over on his debut. Maxwell's struggles continue Rabada to Wade, OUT Umpire Wilson's finger goes up. Rabada has Wade nicking behind! Australia six down and sinking. Angled in on a good length and leaves the left-hander outside off. 144.7ks, that Wade pushes with firm hands and edges it behind to de Kock Phangiso to Finch, OUT Finch clears his front leg and holes out! AB pumps his fist and is mobbed by his team-mates. Finch stepped away outside leg in a bid to open up the off side. He is cramped for room by another quicker ball. 90.3ks. He ends up slicing a drive. AB dives full-stretch to 8.10pm South Africa, playing with three specialist spinners for the first time since 2011 in ODIs, secured their first points in the tri-series with a resounding win. After slumping to 112 for 6, Behardien stroked a mature half-century to boost his side to 189. Parnell then set up the defence by Player of the match is Farhaan Behardien, SA","South Africa 189 for 9 (Behardien 62, Maxwell 2-15, Hazlewood 2-20) beat Australia 142 (Finch 72, Rabada 3-13) by 47 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details South Africa posted only one run more than the 188 they had managed in their triangular series opener against hosts West Indies but it was enough to give them a first win in three meetings against Australia in the Caribbean. The 47-run victory meant that the Guyana leg of the tournament ended with all three teams securing points. Farhaan Behardien's fifth ODI half-century helped South Africa recover from 112 for 6 but it was the bowlers who took them to the win. Fielding an attack that included three specialist spinners for the first time in five years - since their World Cup clash against Bangladesh in 2011 - South Africa allowed only Aaron Finch to score more than 30. Particularly impressive was chinaman bowler Tabraiz Shamsi, who made his debut and threatened a wicket with every ball."
"1.10pm Important toss for Australia to win that. A bit of dew later, some inclement weather around. How much do WI need? Out come the players. They line up on either side of the pitch for a minute of silence for Tony Cozier. Starc to Fletcher, OUT gone. Whoa. Some start this. Full and wide outside off, not a lot of swing but enough. Fletcher wafts at it aimlessly and the skew flies to backward point. Comfortable height and comfortably taken. Starc has a wicket in his first over Starc to Bravo, 1 wide strays in line again. Drifts down leg for an extra Starc to Charles, OUT bowled im. That's why he was brought back. Charles' struggling innings ends. A superb yorker again, not for the first time Charles gets an inside edge but this time it rattled into middle stump. Late swing back in. Superb stuff from S Starc to Ramdin, 2 wide drifts down leg for yet another extra. Wade mis-collects as well Lyon to Samuels, OUT given this time by umpire Brathwaite. Flat on middle and leg, skids on with the arm. The ball thuds into Samuels' pads in front of leg. This time the finger goes up. Samuels went deep in his crease but just missed his flick. Umpire's c Lyon to Pollard, OUT straight to long-on. Pollard falls. Australia have two in two. Lyon has two in two. The same shot that got WI out of trouble in the previous game causes further misery for WI here. Tossed up on middle, some spin takes the inside half o Maxwell to Ramdin, OUT an appeal for lbw, Maxi gets it to straighten, given! Pushed on middle, Ramdin presses forward and plays across the line and is trapped in front. Rapped on the front pad. No inside snick involved. Ump Brathwaite's call is vindicated. Maxwell to Holder, 1 leg bye leg-stump ball, diverted to the right of short leg Zampa to Holder, OUT bowled 'em! Holder rocks away outside leg and exposes all three stumps. Zampa takes aim and locks his target. He fires a slider and takes the off stump. The hosts are seven down Lyon to Benn, OUT Soft, soft dismissal. Khawaja pats Lyon on the head. Looped up on middle, may have stopped a touch on Benn. He has to check his push-drive, he ends up plopping it back to Lyon Zampa to Narine, OUT wrong'un and Zampa strikes again! Narine showed his ace early by dancing out. Zampa dangles a googly outside off, got it to dip as well. Narine aimed a hack across the line and did not touch it. Wade flips the bails off Zampa to Brathwaite, OUT floated on off, 79ks Ricky has a big swing at it. He does not get under it. He has to settle with a sliced hit. Finch pouches it at the edge of the long-on boundary Holder to Finch, OUT plumb in front! Full and straight, Finch shuffles across, trying to flick over midwicket but just plain misses a straight one. The umpire's finger was up quicker than I could say out. Easy decision, Finch doesn't bother reviewing. Narine to Smith, OUT Narine returns and strikes! Umpire Llong's finger goes up. Was that doing too much? Looked so. Biting offbreak, tossed full, from Narine, Smith is deceived and is rapped on the front pad in line with the stumps. Perhaps, curling down l Narine to Maxwell, OUT Narine takes down Maxi for a duck! Big offbreak, rips in from outside off, shoots through the gate and nails the off stump. Maxi aimed a cover drive and missed. Two wickets in three balls for Narine. He still has the fizz That is all we have for you. Thanks for tuning in. Goodbye and cheers! Australia won by 6 wickets (with 146 balls remaining) Player of the match is Nathan Lyon, AUS","Australia 117 for 4 in 25.4 overs (Warner 55*, Narine 2-36) beat West Indies 116 in 32.3 overs (Zampa 3-16, Lyon 3-39) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details ""Spin to win"" became Australia's new catchphrase as Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa left West Indies nursing a six-wicket loss. Mitchell Starc, on his return from foot surgery, added considerable venom to the cause even if his control was still some way short of his 2015 best. Much had been made of Starc's recall, but it was the spin of Lyon, Zampa and Glenn Maxwell that mired the hosts on another sluggish pitch at Providence Stadium in Guyana."
"Starc to Dhananjaya, 1 leg bye full, straight, flicks, misses. Too pacy - 146 kph - for de Silva. Appeared a little lazy there as well. Works for him when he times the ball, not so much now Starc to Fernando, OUT got him! Duck on debut, Starc's got his customary wicket in the first over. Pitched on off stump at a good length, veered back in, hit high-ish on the pad, but that looked quite adjacent. Fernando was pinned to the crease, playing around his front pad, slow in doing so as well. Hastings to Dhananjaya, 1 wide length, too far outside off, de Silva collects an extra Hastings to Dhananjaya, 1 wide slips down leg as de Silva tries a flick. Can't quite reach that far Hastings to Mendis, OUT big appeal for caught behind from the keeper, Wade wants to review, it but the bowler has no clue. Australia have gone for a check with the third umpire. There seems a noise, and a deviation as well when the ball passes the outside edge. I'm not sure they use Snicko here as part of the DRS. But even without it, Mendis has been given, fair call from Aleem Dar. It was a good length ball in the o Boland to Chandimal, OUT won't be saving Sri Lanka this time. It's a length ball outside off, Chandimal wants to paste it through extra cover. Wasn't supposed to play it off the front foot with the length being reasonably short. The bounce does him, takes the edge and goes through to the keeper Hastings to Perera, OUT gets him. Hastings bangs one in with a cross-seam delivery banged in on a short length. Dilruwan was through the stroke too early and gets a thin outside edge to Wade. More signs of the slow surface as Dilruwan was through his pull early Hastings to Pathirana, OUT gone. Pathirana holes out to long-off. Not a good shot again. Slower ball outside off, Pathirana goes back in his crease and chips a catch to long-off. Hastings gets five, his best ODI bowling figures 6.50 pm We're back for the chase. SL need early wickets. Australia don't. The rain has all passed long ago. Covers had to be brought on at the break, but they've all been banished from view. Clear skies now. Thisara Perera has the new ball in hand. David Warner is not amused by everything behind the bowler's arm. Makes us all wait.. and wait... and... here we go Pathirana to Finch, OUT Pathirana pleads and pleads and pleads and finally umpire Palliyaguruge says yes. Finch given lbw, but he reviews. Pushed through on middle, Finch went for the premeditated sweep, his front foot was across, and he was hit on the edge of his front pad. Hit well in line. But would that go on to knock over leg stump? Oh, HawkEye says it would just clip it! The ball and the stump are almost tangen Pathirana to Khawaja, OUT two in the over! Khawaja stands, looks down, and walks off forlornly. This is tossed up on off stump, beats the inside edge of the prodding bat and thuds into the front pad. Right in front of middle, should be hitting leg, Pathirana screams, but no one can here him because all of Dambulla are screaming as well. Oh wait, HawkEye says that would be missing. There is plenty of turn out there, b Perera to Bailey, SIX runs down the track this time over long-on! Dilruwan had pulled his length back, but the batsman must have guessed that. Hared at him and flicks him away Pathirana to Warner, OUT that is superb! Warner steps down the track, but he can't get to the pitch of the ball. Lovely flight, and then it dips on the batsman. So beautiful Warner tries to push at the ball, having originally planned to slam it down the ground. He doesn't know how much it would turn. He doesn't know what to do. Ends up defending inside the line and the ball beats his outside edge to crash into his st Pathirana to Head, 1 wide pitches a little short and just outside off, Head waits in his crease and watches the ball turn big down the leg side Perera to Bailey, 1 leg bye false shot, but he gets away with it. The right idea, but Dilruwan pulled his length back, Bailey dances down but doesn't get there. Clips the pad, and then past the keeper Perera to Wade, SIX runs there it is. Australia complete the series win Flight from Dilruwan, Wade gets underneath the length and lofts the ball way over long-on. Wade is pumped, hugs Bailey, who has played an absolute blinder. Bailey picks up a couple of stumps. Wade does so too. 9.00pm What a chase this has been. 213 was never going to be easy, it wasn't but Australia made it look like a canter. Finch first blitzed an 18-ball half-century, equalling the fastest by an Australian. Sachith Pathirana picked up three wickets in five balls but the damage was done. The surface was spinning viciously but George Bailey controlled the chase thereafter, reverse sweeping and sweeping Australia to the target. Australia won by 6 wickets (with 114 balls remaining) Player of the match is John Hastings, AUS","Australia 217 for 4 (Bailey 90*, Finch 55, Pathirana 3-37) beat Sri Lanka 212 (De Silva 76, Hastings 6-45) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Who needs a world-record ODI total? There was plenty of breathless action in Dambulla without one. Aaron Finch smashed the equal fastest ODI fifty by an Australian. John Hastings took six wickets. Angelo Mathews limped off with a calf injury while batting. Dhananjaya de Silva entertained with a breezy 76."
"2.00pm Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat. A few changes for Australia. Marsh comes in for Smith, Hastings in for Henriques, Hazlewood back for Lyon. Starc to Gunathilaka, OUT bowled. There is Starc's customary first-over wicket. What a delivery again. Fuller than a good length - the ideal length. Gunathilaka is neither forward nor back, so he tentatively pokes at the length. Since there is no swing, the ball carries on towards the inside edge, kisses that edge and rattles into middle stu Hazlewood to Mendis, OUT got 'im this time. A superb comeback from Hazlewood. Drags his length back this time, close to off. Mendis has to defend, and although the ball doesn't move, it still takes Mendis' outside edge. Carries low to Warner at second slip who dives in front and completes a quality catch. SL in some trouble Hastings to Dilshan, 1 wide a short loopy bouncer, signalled wide. Tennis ball bounce. Dilshan thinks of pulling but withdraws, rightly so. Would have had to generate his own power Zampa to Dilshan, OUT he's gone off a full toss and that's that for Dilshan's ODI career! He came down the track and chipped the low full toss to midwicker where Bailey had to jump a little to catch it over his head. A few handhakes from some of the Australian fielders, a pat from Chandimal and Dilshan immediately takes his helmet off and w Zampa to Angelo Mathews, OUT loud appeal for lbw and Aleem Dar has raised the finger, it wasn't plumb, and Mathews reviews. It wasn't as flighted, pitched somewhere around leg stump, replays will confirm that, and straightened to beat Mathews' inside edge before hitting him in front of leg. Here comes ball tracking - pitches in line, straig Faulkner to Dhananjaya, OUT he tries to accelerate and hands a catch to mid-on, good work there by Shaun Marsh! Came down the track and took the ball on the full, stroking the ball in the air and Marsh dived to his left after a few steps to grab it with both hands Starc to Perera, OUT too good! Another swinging yorker does for Kusal. Tailed in on leg, Kusal misses his flick and the ball hits leg stump. Some discernible late movement back in. May have ricocheted off the pads, and then into the stumps Hastings to Perera, OUT taken! What was that from Perera. Pace off the ball from Hastings, Perera went through with his wild hoick and only succeeded in slogging it into the hands of deep square leg. Lovely bowling, wily change in pace. Zampa to Prasanna, OUT picks out deep midwicket. Filthy half-tracker on off, Prasanna rocks back and nails his pull, but straight to Bailey who sets himself under and takes it. Not the way Zampa would have wanted to get that Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 wide another wide, way outside the tramline Hastings to Perera, OUT gone this time. A short delivery on off, bouncer. Dilruwan stays in his crease and checks his pull straight to Warner at midwicket. Didn't keep it down, didn't go after it. Lobbed a catch instead Faulkner to Chandimal, OUT nice catch from Zampa at long-on to end the innings. A slower ball on off, Chandimal comes down and swings through the line, the ball goes up, stays up for quite a while, but Zampa sets himself under it at long-on and takes a good catch. 6.25pm A superb effort from Chandimal carries Sri Lanka to 226, a score they will take after that middle-overs stutter. Batting in his final ODI, Dilshan got Sri Lanka off to a solid start but picked out midwicket for 42. Sri Lanka kept losing wickets through the middle, setting them back, but Chandimal ensured he stayed there till the end to give 6.50pm 227 it is for Australia. Not such a stiff target on this pitch which is not turning like Colombo. But they are without Smith so a lot will depend on captain Warner. He walks out with Aaron Finch as Mathews' players take the field. Mathews will open the bowling himself, no slips in place for Warner. Some sight screen issues being sorted as W Perera to Warner, 1 wide gets the line wrong with a wide down the leg side Angelo Mathews to Warner, OUT yes, it's him! Dilshan takes a superb diving catch at point and yes, it's Warner who has to go! Looked like a bit of extra bounce outside off as Warner checked his jab but did it with hard hands, the bounce takes a good meat of the bat to fly towards point where Dilshan dives low to his left to get both his hand Aponso to Finch, OUT big big appeal from Aponso, Aleem Dar raises the finger, Finch has a short chat and walks off without reviewing it. This was looped towards the stumps and Finch tried to defend by covering them all, maybe he played for the turn but the ball angled in and trapped him right in front. Was it headed a bit too much towards le Angelo Mathews to Marsh, OUT chipped in the air, taken at mid-off! But is it clean? Shaun Marsh wants to hang around as the third umpire is called in and the soft signal is out. It was a fullish delivery outside off, Marsh chipped it half-heartedly down to mid-off where Chandimal dives forward and takes it. A lot of replays being shown for t Prasanna to Head, 1 wide ooh, great work from slip. Flat down leg, Head misses his sweep. So does the keeper after some vicious spin, but DdS gets around and prevents more wides Dhananjaya to Bailey, 1 leg bye lots of air down leg, Bailey gets down to reverse sweep but misses as the ball hits him on the thigh Perera to Wade, OUT another stumping appeal and this time the finger has gone up, third umpire not required! Wade tried the sweep yet again but did not connect at all, by the time the ball reached Kusal, Wade was well outside the crease, almost losing balance, with the stretch and Kusal whipped the bails off by the time Wade could drag it b Prasanna to Bailey, OUT it's gone through, Bailey is bowled! The conventional legspinning delivery with some revs on it, it was flighted on leg sutmp and Bailey leaned forward to defend for the turn, bat in front of middle, but it didn't turn and deflected off the front pad to the stumps instead Aponso to Faulkner, OUT oh my, Faulkner has holed out to deep square leg, the crowd comes alive! Where have these people come from? Unnecessary shot from Faulkner, sweeping the length ball against the turn to the leg side and Dilruwan only had to go a bit to his left to take that comfortably, well inside the boundary Some felicitation and gifts for Dilshan for his ODI farewell. Fireworks go off at the ground and I shall head off too. That's all from me, Vishal Dikshit, and Nikhil Kalro from this ODI in Dambulla, thanks fo joining us. Australia won by 2 wickets (with 24 balls remaining) Player of the match is George Bailey, AUS","Australia 227 for 8 (Bailey 70, Wade 42) beat Sri Lanka 226 (Chandimal 102, Zampa 3-38) by 2 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details There were reasons for Sri Lankan fans to cheer at the third ODI in Dambulla. But the result wasn't one of them. On a day when Tillakaratne Dilshan was farewelled from one-day international cricket, and Dinesh Chandimal scored his fourth ODI hundred, Australia held on for a tense victory that gave them a 2-1 series lead with two to play - and gave David Warner a 100% success rate as an international captain. Not that it was all smooth sailing. Chasing 227, Australia relatively cruised most of the way."
"Lyon to Dilshan, OUT bowled'im around the legs, is he? They are checking with the replays and it shows the ball touched the pad before clipping the leg stump. Lyon around the wicket, pitches it around middle and leg and gets it to turn a bit, Dilshan wanted to work it away gently with the turn but inadvertently exposed his leg stump and the ball got deflected off the thigh pad and onto the stump. Lyon to Chandimal, 1 wide almost like the ball that got Dilshan but this one goes further down leg for a wide Head to Mendis, 1 wide tries to pull a flatter ball but makes no contact, that was down leg side Zampa to Mendis, 1 wide that is extremely wide outside off stump Head to Chandimal, 1 wide strays down leg side, the batsman misses the glance Zampa to Chandimal, OUT Wade fails to collect the ball and misses the stumping! Chandimal came down the track to work the ball to leg against the turn but missed it completely! Wade missed it too after the ball clipped the top of the back pad and he now insists on using the review for lbw. Smith calls for the review. Replays show the ball is close to the inside edge of the bat as Chandimal tried Zampa to Mendis, OUT loud appeal for lbw with the googly, he's got the big wicket of Kusal Mendis! Nicely tossed up on off stump, Mendis played for the legspin with the front pad in front of the stumps and bat outside the line, but the ball turns in enough to hit him right in front of the stumps. Easy decision, that one and a big breakthrough! Zampa to Dhananjaya, OUT that's number three for Zampa, good low catch from Smith at cover! Flighted as usual outside off, de Silva opened up and drove hard with a big swing, looking to go through the covers, but handed it straight to the captain Faulkner to Perera, 1 leg bye on the leg stump again, Kusal tries to work it behind square but gets another leg bye Faulkner to Perera, OUT loud appeal for lbw from Faulkner - both arms in the air like Akram - and the finger goes up! It was the slower one and absolutely full, hitting Kusal's boot as he tried for another reverse swat, but missed it, taking it in front of middle leg stump Henriques to Perera, SIX runs short ball, pulled away, Smith jumps at the boundary but it sails over him! Faulkner to Perera, OUT that's a hat-trick from Faulkner, he's knocked over the stumps now! Thisara made some room, Faulkner targetted the stumps and beat the batsman who tried to cut but the bat came down too late. And Faulkner, who does it so often in the slog overs, is pulling things back here. Don't forget his performane in the first ODI! Starc to Perera, OUT he's hit the off stump, Starc, you beauty! He bowled that one from wide of the crease with the angle, targetted the off stump with some pace and Dilruwan showed his bat on the wrong line Starc to Aponso, OUT Starc takes his third, he's hit the stumps again and SL are bowled out! From wide of the crease again, right in the block hole and through the batsman to hit the middle and leg stumps! 6.44pm All right then, 289 is the number for Australia. Sri Lanka's spin attack stands in their way. David Warner will take strike against Angelo Mathews. A wide and deep slip, keeper standing up... Prasanna to Wade, 1 wide turns it down the leg side for a wide Perera to Bailey, 1 wide bowled wide down leg side, Bailey gets across and tries to sweep but misses, that has been called wide Aponso to Bailey, OUT bowled him! Bailey's struggle is over for the night. Aponso slowed it up by giving the ball a lot of air, drawing Bailey forward into the cover drive. more of a slap really because he was not to the pitch of the ball. The ball then dipped on the right-hander, falling under his bat and skidded straight on with the arm, instead of spinning away, to hit off stump Aponso to Wade, 1 wide huge appeal for caught behind down the leg side but the umpire says not out, Wade's sweep was uncontrolled and he took one hand off the handle as he played the shot, the ball spun and bounced and just seemed to miss the glove Prasanna to Lyon, no run six balls, six sweeps and it ends the way it started - fails to connect 9.52pm That's a collective performance from SL to make it 1-1. The first innings saw a lot of momentum shifts with three fifties and three wickets for each of Starc, Faulkner (hat-trick) and Zampa. In Australia's chase, SL made sure they got the more dangerous batsmen out of the way early before Mathew Wade's career-best 76. But the asking rate kept creeping up and the SL spinners did the rest. Four wic Time for the presentation: Player of the match is Angelo Mathews, SL","Sri Lanka 288 (Mendis 69, Mathews 57, K Perera 54, Zampa 3-42, Faulkner 3-45, Starc 3-53) beat Australia 206 (Wade 76, Aponso 4-18, T Perera 3-33) by 82 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:58 By the Numbers: Aponso's four-four sinks Australia Sri Lanka's openers gone cheaply. A recovery led by Kusal Mendis. A Sri Lankan attack heavy on spin options. Australia's batsmen struggling to have any impact. A Sri Lankan victory."
"Faulkner to Mendis, OUT got 'im! One mistake too many for Mendis as he pulls too early, gets a top edge and offers a dolly of a catch - for once where the fielder was. Head at midwicket takes it and Australia celebrate, giving thanks to Faulkner's offcutter slower ball holding in the pitch Starc to Dhananjaya, OUT 100 ODI wickets, and he is the fastest ever to that mark in cricket history! Big, tall, scary fast bowler makes history with a innocuous, pace-less, slow old teaser. Ah, irony. Starc had de Silva reaching outside off, thinking it was up there for a cover drive, but the ball holds in the pitch and pops over to short midwicket. Bailey moves to his right, dives and secures it. Brilliant piece of deception from Starc, and sign that he is evolving. Faulkner to Perera, OUT goes for the lap sweep.... and picks out short fine leg! If he was intending to use the pace of the ball, there was very little on it. A 116 kph fuller ball on leg stump gives Faulkner his fourth 6.30 pm A fairly in-between kind of total, Sri Lanka at one point looked good for 250 with their Nos. 3 and 4 hitting fifties. But neither Kusal Mendis nor Dinesh Chandimal found the going easy on a dry pitch which gave plenty for bowlers willing to slow the pace down. James Faulkner is just that kind of bowler, and he ended up with four wickets on his comeback. Have I missed anything? Hmm.. I keep having this voice in my head saying I've made a glaring err... oh yeah, Mitchell Starc coolly became the fastest bowler to take 100 ODI wickets beating a 19-year old record held by Pakistan offspinner Saqlain Mushtaq. Angelo Mathews to Finch, 1 wide leg-side wide, but replays indicate that may have glanced the thigh Aponso to Smith, 1 leg bye follows the break with the skidder that pins Smith on the back foot. Rapped on the pad, but this was sliding down Perera to Smith, 3 wide breaking down the leg side, Smith aims to shovel it away. He is beaten, as is Kusal Perera to Smith, 1 wide breaking down leg, wide Sandakan to Wade, 1 wide short and sliding down leg, googly, Wade swings and loses his shape. Wide Sandakan to Bailey, 1 wide pitches on middle and then turns further down leg, Bailey attempts a flick but he may as well have left the ball considering how far the ball turned. Great work from keeper Perera Aponso to Smith, 1 wide pushed through down leg Perera to Bailey, 1 wide poor line form Dilruwan, pitching on middle stump when the ball is spinning big. Great take from Kusal again Dilshan to Faulkner, 1 wide tossed up, a little quick on leg stump, Faulkner goes for the sweep and it just misses leg stump. Wide called with the batsman having swept from outside off 10.30 pm That's a wrap, hope you enjoyed having a little bit of cricket come at you when rain has ravaged the game for the last couple of days. The next ODI of the series is on Wednesday, hope to see you then too. Australia won by 3 wickets (with 19 balls remaining) Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS","Australia 228 for 7 (Smith 58, Finch 56, Bailey 39, Dilruwan Perera 3-48) beat Sri Lanka 227 for 8 (Chandimal 80*, Kusal Mendis 67, Faulkner 4-38, Starc 3-32) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:48 By the Numbers - Starc's record, and run-machine Smith Sri Lanka had no fewer than six slow-bowling options - half of them specialists. And by the time Australia batted, the dry Premadasa pitch had begun to bubble and spit. In the Tests, these ingredients had led to humbling defeats for the visitors while the local spinners reaped sackfuls of wickets. But perhaps for the first time on tour, Australia satisfactorily negotiated the spin challenge. The win wasn't always pretty, but it was comfortable enough."
"1pm: South Africa win the toss and bowl, and the big team news is that Hashim Amla is out with the flu. Rilee Rossouw will take his place (there's no Temba Bavuma, who scored a ton against Ireland on debut last week, in the SA squad); Dwaine Pretorius and Aaron Phangiso lose out to the returning Dale Steyn and Imran Tahir. Steven Smith says he would have prefer Steyn to Warner, 1 leg bye short, slightly leg side, jumps a bit and deflects behind square off the padding Rabada to Warner, 1 wide bangs in the short ball this time, climbs too high Rabada to Finch, 1 leg bye fullish, curving in, flicks off the pad as Finch works across the line Phehlukwayo to Finch, OUT short ball, flicked off the body in the air, Parnell throws himself forward at short fine leg... but did it carry? The SA fielders think so but Finch stands his ground and the third umpire will have to make a call on this. It was a tumbling effort on the edge of the ring, looks on first glance that he managed to get his fingers Phehlukwayo to Smith, 1 wide dug in and flying through above head height, Smith barely glances at it Parnell to Marsh, 1 leg bye round the wicket, speared into the pads, tucked behind square Phehlukwayo to Marsh, OUT edged, and stunningly caught by a one-handed de Kock behind the stumps! The extra delivery pays dividends, as Marsh hangs back in the crease, is drawn into a loose poke by the extra bounce, and the keeper snaffles it almost in slow motion, high to his right! Lucky strikes again! Trebles all round! Tahir to Head, OUT that is tremendous wrist-spin bowling. Beautiful flight, luring Head out of the crease, dipping late, and lo and behold, it's the googly to boot. Zips past a flailing edge like a winger side-stepping the fullback, and off come the bails! Phehlukwayo to Bailey, OUT on the pads, clipped to midwicket and David Miller, on the dive, smashes the stumps at the non-striker's end with Wade nowhere close to the picture! Outstanding sharp work and a vital breakthrough Steyn to Bailey, OUT the slower ball does him! Bailey gets right underneath it and slogs to mid-on, all height and no trousers, Australia's linchpin falls! Still almost three overs to go but Bailey had to try and get on with it if they are to breach 300 Steyn to Zampa, OUT scooped straight up and taken at mid-on! Second wicket for Dale Steyn, a carbon copy of Bailey's dismissal, the cutter too cute for Zampa and it's catching practice for Miller on the edge of the circle South Africa won by 6 wickets (with 82 balls remaining) Player of the match is Quinton de Kock, SA","South Africa 295 for 4 (de Kock 178, Boland 3-67) beat Australia 294 for 9 (Bailey 74, Phehlukwayo 4-44) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Quinton de Kock became the holder of South Africa's second-highest individual score in ODI cricket with a career-best 178 as his side eased to a series opening victory over Australia. De Kock steered South Africa to the third-highest successful chase at SuperSport Park and ensured they drew first blood in a weekend of clashes against Australia. Sandwiched between ODIs on Friday and Sunday is a Rugby Championship fixture on Saturday. All the matches take place on the Highveld, de Kock's stomping ground, and on Friday night, he owned it. None of the Australian bowlers were spared de Kock's aggression."
"9.30am Ireland have won the toss and are batting first. Worrall to Porterfield, 1 leg bye fires it down the leg side, looks to flick it but wears it on the pad Worrall to Porterfield, SIX runs Porterfield pulls the ball over the top of long leg and the ball goes all the way for a six! Great shot from the Ireland Captain Worrall to Stirling, FOUR runs Stirling gets the over off to a good start by smashing the ball back over the bowler's head. The umpires have sent it upstairs to see if its a six or a four. Upon Close-ups, it looks like it could have been a six, but its given as four Boland to Stirling, OUT Stirling hits the ball in the air towards cover point, just couldn't get on top of the ball. Ends up hitting it straight into the fielder's hands. First wicket gone. Marsh to Porterfield, 1 wide goes down the legside, called a wide Boland to Anderson, 1 wide far too wide outside off-stump and it's another wide for Australia Zampa to Porterfield, OUT Another wicket goes down! Its the flipper from Zampa and Porterfield looks to pull the ball into the legside. It keeps low and hits him in front of the stumps. Porterfield knew that he was gone and didn't even need to look at the umpire. Head down and kept walking back Marsh to Anderson, 1 wide off-side wide Marsh to Anderson, 5 wide a wild ball from Marsh, its far too short and goes over the top of the batsman's head. Even Wade behind the stumps can't stop it and it goes all the way to the boundary. Wides Boland to Anderson, OUT Anderson stays in the crease again and looks to turn the ball into the off-side. Gets hit on the pad and the umpire's finger goes up. Anderson reviews the decision. No bat on the ball and it does look a touch high. It bounces in line and it's just clipping the top of the bails. It's the umpire's call and Anderson Boland to K O'Brien, 1 wide Boland goes down the legside and it's yet another wide.... Marsh to Murtagh, 1 wide leg-side wide Hastings to McCarthy, OUT McCarthy gets a ball in the arc and swings at the ball, it goes high in the air and Bailey gets under the ball at point and takes a comfortable catch Hastings to Murtagh, OUT the batsmen had crossed whilst the ball was in the air and so Murtagh was on strike. He chips a ball from outside off into Bailey's hands at backward point. Tame end to the innings Hastings to McCarthy, OUT McCarthy gets a ball in the arc and swings at the ball, it goes high in the air and Bailey gets under the ball at point and takes a comfortable catch Hastings to Murtagh, OUT the batsmen had crossed whilst the ball was in the air and so Murtagh was on strike. He chips a ball from outside off into Bailey's hands at backward point. Tame end to the innings 1.20pm So Ireland fall just short of 200, and once again fail to bat out the 50 overs. That's the third time in a row that this has happened. Even though they batted better today than they did against South Africa, being 121 for 2 at one stage, they will be disappointed to have been dismissed for 198. Just in: AB de Villiers has been ruled out of the home ODI and away Test series against Australia with an elbow injury. Welcome back, Ireland know that they need wickets, so we should see some attacking fields. Australia need just under four an over. Chase to open the bowling McCarthy to Khawaja, 1 wide goes down the legside again, called wide Murtagh to Warner, 1 wide yet another wide, been far too many of them from both sides today. Down the legside McCarthy to Warner, SIX runs Warner goes for a big one! It's in the slot and Warner smashes the ball over the top of the long-off boundary. Cracking shot Chase to Warner, 1 wide Chase comes back on from the other end and is around the wicket to Warner. Goes down the legside and it's yet another wide K O'Brien to Smith, 1 wide O'Brien goes for a slower ball bouncer and its goes over Smith's head and gets called for another wide At the top level you have to take every chance that comes along and once again Ireland didn't do that today. For Australia this was a perfect start of their South Africa tour, all of their bowlers took wickets and all top order fired. What more could you ask for? 4.10pm With that scrambled clip into the legside, Australia complete a nine wicket win with 119 balls remaining. A comprehensive win, which was never really in doubt once both Warner and Khawaja put on 73 for the first wicket. Ireland weren't threatening enough with the ball, they just couldn't stop the batsmen from scoring. Sure, dropped catc Australia won by 9 wickets (with 119 balls remaining) Player of the match is Usman Khawaja, AUS","Australia 199 for 1 (Khawaja 82*, Smith 59*) beat Ireland 198 (Anderson 39, Zampa 3-37) by nine wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Adam Zampa's spell of 3 for 37 saw him become the leading ODI wicket-taker of the year AFP Ireland's highest score in five meetings against Australia was not enough to even mildly challenge the top-ranked ODI side, who eased to victory with 19.5 overs to spare in a chase of 199. What will sting Ireland most is that they could have done much better. They squandered the chance to post a competitive total with a mid-innings collapse that took them from 121 for 2 to 146 for 6, and lost their last eight wickets for 77 runs. None of their batsmen touched 40 while the three batsmen Australia needed all scored more than that."
"6.30pm David Warner calls wrong. Sri Lanka have won the toss, will bat first. The crowd can get their 'Dilshan' placards ready. The bands will be out in full force. It should be a festive evening. Hopefully we have a wonderful game to round off what has been a superb series. Who would've thought we'd get the amount of cricket we have? Rains have stayed away and it's likely to stay that way again tonight Faulkner to Perera, OUT Warner tears to his right from mid-on and takes a great diving catch. For a moment, it seemed mid-off would collide with the captain, but Wade probably backed out of the way seeing Warner dash in. This wasn't the cutter, good length on middle, stopped a bit on Kusal. He attempts a leg-side flick and spoons a leading edge in the air. A prowling Warner latches onto the chance Faulkner to Chandimal, OUT Chandi feebly chips a return catch! Not the cutter, seam-up from Faulkner, Chandi shimmies out and attempts a leg-side shot. He only manages a leading edge back to the bowler. Faulkner moves to his right and snaps it up Zampa to Mendis, OUT Zampa roars an appeal for lbw, given by umpire Palliyaguruge. Did the pitch outside leg? Zampa held this back and found a bit of turn to rap the front pad as Mendis missed a sweep. The HawkEye shows that it pitched just outside leg Zampa to Kapugedera, OUT Warner in the thick of things in Colombo. This was the fast slider outside off, 96.2ks, shorter and outside off. Kapu wants to pull but ends up dragging the ball in the air. Waner throws himself to his left and completes a smart, low catch at midwicket Zampa to Perera, OUT Thisara now holes out, SL six down. Short legbreak on top of middle. Thisara takes it on with a pull. He has to settle with a miscue to deep square leg, where Head clings onto it. He exits for a duck Henriques to Pathirana, 1 wide good length and outside off, climbs sharply outside off, Pathirana attempted a slash and missed, but the line was too wide outside off Hastings to Pathirana, OUT SL seven down and sinking Hastings returns and strikes. Banged in short on off, cramps Pathirana for room, who was on the front foot. He gets into a tangle. Pulls and splices a return catch Starc to Dhananjaya, 1 wide he goes wide of the crease and angles a slower one down leg, 100 up for SL Faulkner to Prasanna, OUT Prasanna holes out to long-on. Full on middle, in the slot for Prasanna to put it away. He swings for the hills and ends up getting more height rather than distance. Khawaja settles under the skier Hastings to Senanayake, 1 wide bouncer outside off, too high, balloons to the keeper. Wide. Tennis-ball loopy bounce, raises a puff of dust from the surface. One for the over, says the ump Starc to Senanayake, 1 wide Starc ventures wide of the crease and angles another leg-side wide Starc to Dhananjaya, OUT Starc in danger of going wicketless for the first time on the tour Full toss outside off, Dhana aims to pump it over the infield. He can only skew it off the bottom part of the bat. He got it over extra-cover, but mid-off tracked to his left and pouched it. Good catch from Faulkner 10.05pm That is that. End of Dilshan's 497th and last international match. Australia crash his farewell party. He, however, reaches out to the crowd, takes high-fives, and acknowledges the applause. He signs off with a wicket off his last delivery in international cricket. #ThankyouDilshan 10.05pm That is that. End of Dilshan's 497th and last international match. Australia crash his farewell party. He, however, reaches out to the crowd, takes high-fives, and acknowledges the applause. He signs off with a wicket off his last delivery in international cricket. #ThankyouDilshan 10.45pm Warner collects the trophy and soaks in the moment with his team-mates. Andrew Fernando's report will tell you the full story of Dilshan's farewell match. Australia won by 4 wickets (with 13 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 130 for 6 (Maxwell 66, Warner 25, Dilshan 2-8, Pathirana 2-23) beat Sri Lanka 128 for 9 (Dhananjaya 62, Zampa 3-16, Faulkner 3-9) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Sri Lanka had been changing their side every match and Australia had already sent several men home, but like a well-heeled theatre troupe, the players that remained delivered the same performance they seemed to have given many times over this series. Sri Lanka won the toss again, batted again, did well for a little while, but mainly collapsed to a modest 128 for 9. Australia were disciplined with the ball, and athletic in the field, bruising at the top of their innings, a little shakier in the middle against spin, but got home with some comfort. The margin of this particular victory was four wickets, and they had 13 balls to spare - Glenn Maxwell providing the game's best innings again. If you have been following this series closely, though, this report may feel familiar."
"Starc to Dhananjaya, 1 wide that's gone way too wide with the angle and it's a wide Faulkner to Dhananjaya, 1 wide back of length and down leg for a wide Faulkner to Dhananjaya, OUT the angle has done the trick, de Silva has given a catch straight to mid-on! Back of length from Faulkner and angling in, de Silva didn't move much and then punched it straight to Starc at chest height. De Silva's disappointed with himself as Faulkner punched the air twice! Zampa to Gunathilaka, OUT bowled around his legs! The second time he has attempted that shot even though the ball is headed for the stumps. This flatter delivery pitched on leg, he looks to sweep it fine by exposing his leg stump and the ball goes straight to rattle the leg sutmp as Gunathilaka misses Starc to Chandimal, OUT another one, Starc has struck indeed and SL lose their third in 10 balls! He banged it in short again, Chandimal looked to guide the ball fine this time by going on his toes but he only feathers an outside edge to the keeper! Replays show it was the glove actually, the pace and bounce did him! Head to Upul Tharanga, OUT beautifully bowled. Lots of loop and flight outside off, Tharanga drives early and away from his body, the ball stops in the surface and spins a touch. Tharanga lobs an easy catch to point off the outside half of his bat. Poor shot, but induced by some clever change in pace Starc to Perera, 1 leg bye drifts down leg, off Kusal's pad for a leg bye to fine leg Head to Perera, OUT Kusal reviews immediately, umpire Palliyaguruge gives him. Looked like an inside edge. Only decision for the umpire to make is if there is some bat. Seems like there is some bat. Flat on middle, this one doesn't spin. Kusal comes forward but the ball strikes the pad via the bat, right in front of off. Yes, big edge. This should be overturned. All reds on ball-tracking. Wait, this is not overturned. Kusal shakes his Zampa to Shanaka, 1 wide flatter one down the leg side for a wide now Zampa to Shanaka, OUT that's the straighter one and Shanaka is bowled! The batsman made a tiny bit of room, playing for the turn as the ball pitched on off, he stayed back to cut it but missed as the ball zipped through to hit off Starc to Perera, OUT the angle does it again, off stump knocked over! That one zipped through the defence as Dilruwan looked to defend it in front of off, the ball nipped in sharply from outside off and beat the outside edge to hit the stump Starc to Lakmal, OUT that's a yorker at 147kmh and whams into the middle stump! The angle, the speed, the length...all come together to push Lakmal on the back foot, he tries to block the ball but it beats him completely to disturb the bottom of middle stump Boland to Pathirana, OUT can't clear mid-off and SL are bowled out for 195! Pitched up, he lofts the ball on the off side but doesn't get enough and Faulkner takes a couple of steps back to catch that easily 5.32pm Sri Lanka must be distraught with their efoorts here. De Silva and Gunathilaka didn't give Starc a wicket in the opening spell and started picking boundaries too in their half-century stand but once Faulkner broke the stand, wickets kept tumbling and lack of partnerships led to their downfall. No batsman reached the forties as all bowlers except Zampa kept the scoring rate under check, picked wickets (which Zampa did too) and SL never Lakmal to Bailey, 1 wide strays down leg this time, wide Lakmal to Warner, 1 leg bye back of a length down leg, 136 kph. Off the pad to fine leg as Warner is beaten for pace Perera to Bailey, OUT a strong appeal, the finger goes up and the crowd has been shaken alive. But hang on, Bailey has reviewed it! It was pretty full around leg, Bailey swept and missed and took it low on his front pad. Looks like there's no edge, all depends on where the ball pitched. Here comes ball-tracking - it has pitched in line, hit in line and 'umpire's call' for hitting the stumps. So umpire Palliyaguruge's decision stays Pathirana to Faulkner, 1 wide flat delivery that strays down leg, wide called 9.10pm Clinical chase from Australia to finish out the series positively, led by captain David Warner who returned to form with a superb century, his seventh in ODIs, and the first by an Australian in Sri Lanka in this format. Dilruwan injected some excitement into the match with two early wickets, but Bailey and Warner first stabilised the innings, before getting into their own. A comfortable chase in the end as Australia close out the seri 9.30pm Wide grins on the Australia players' faces, and with that we'll sign off from the ODI series. Thanks for your feedback, time and opinions. The T20s aren't far away. See you then. Australia won by 5 wickets (with 42 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 199 for 5 (Warner 106, Bailey 44, Dilruwan 3-51) beat Sri Lanka 195 (Gunathilaka 39, Starc 3-40) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For the fifth time in the series Sri Lanka batted first and a vaguely familiar match played out as Australia ran down the hosts' 195 in the 43rd over, zipping up the series 4-1. Mitchell Starc was denied his customary early wicket this time, but Sri Lanka's middle-order collapse happened anyway, as it often has in the past two weeks. Australia's top order then delivered another consummate performance on a spinning track; the margin of victory was five wickets, but it seemed even more comfortable than that. It was David Warner, who provided the spine to this particular chase. He capped an outstanding eight days as captain by scoring Australia's first ODI century in Sri Lanka - his 106 from 126 balls measured and delicate, in contrast to his usual maurauding style."
"1.00pm South Africa won the toss and chose to bat Mennie to du Plessis, OUT another one! Faf troubled with some nagging lines attempts an exuberant lofted drive, but the ball pitches on off and moves back in. Not prodigious but enough and beats Faf's inside edge and take the top of off and middle. Faf undone by pressure and the movement, both equally responsible for the wicket Head to Rossouw, 1 wide slides one down the leg side, keeper does well to half-stop that Head to Duminy, 1 wide fires one into the pads, the direction is wrong. Duminy misses a fine paddle too Zampa to Duminy, 1 wide gets it wrong, too short and down leg. Duminy looks to whip it fine but misses Mennie to Duminy, 1 wide gets the direction of that short delivery wrong, well down the leg side as Duminy misses the pull Head to Duminy, 1 wide fires one down leg, well stopped by the keeper Mennie to Duminy, OUT out! Soft dismissal. Duminy falls. A rather selfless stroke. Full and wide outside off, Duminy wanted to open the face to drive towards deep cover in order to get Rossouw back on strike. Instead, carves a ball to backward point because the ball is too wide to fetch and hit that much in front of square. Quality, quality knock from JP. Hardly mis-hit a ball Tremain to Miller, 1 wide another back-of-the-hand slower one that goes horribly wrong and slips outside the side line. Keeper collects on the bounce Boland to Phehlukwayo, SIX runs he's clobbered that into the stands at deep midwicket. He set himself for that biff and the short ball merely aided him as he swung across the line to generate the power Boland to Phehlukwayo, OUT super delivery. Death rattle. This is full and straight on middle, he looks to back away and squeeze that behind point but the ball clattered into the stumps off a very fine inside-edge. Tremain to Rossouw, OUT slogged across the line, and he's holed out to Mitch Marsh at long-on. It was the slower one which he didn't completely get underneath and only managed to skew it off the bottom half of the bat. He knew immediately that it wasn't timed well. Rossouw walks off to a round of applause, this has been a super knock Tremain to Miller, OUT picks out Steven Smith at deep cover. Looked like he wanted to hit it to wide long-off but stiff breeze may have played part in him not hitting it where it wanted. It was a slower delivery too, which made it all the more tougher for Miller. Useful knock nonetheless Tremain to Abbott, 1 wide rip roaring bouncer first up, Abbott sways out of the way but umpire deems it a little too high. Touched close to 140 clicks with that Tremain to Abbott, OUT pokes at that without any conviction and the thick edge has been well taken by Wade, who dives full-length forward to complete the low catch. Third umpire was called for and replays only confirmed Wade's belief. Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 leg bye deflects off the pad to the leg side as he looks to tickle it fine Steyn to Zampa, 1 wide slower delivery way outside off, just toeing with the wide line Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","South Africa 327 for 8 (Rossouw 122, Duminy 73, Mennie 3-49) beat Australia 296 (Warner 173, Tahir 2-42, Abbott 2-48) by 31 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:59 By the Numbers - Australia suffer rare whitewash South Africa inflicted a first-ever five-match ODI series whitewash on Australia with a tense victory that underlined the main difference between the two sides. Not only was Australia's inexperienced attack unable to challenge South Africa's batsmen, but their batting line-up, bar David Warner, could not keep up either. Warner scored his second century of the series and was Australia's only real hope of pulling off the highest successful chase at Newlands to take home a consolation win after Rilee Rossouw's third ODI century - a 118-ball 122 - propelled South Africa to 327 for 8. Warner's 173 was six short of a career-best, but could have ended on 11 when he edged Kagiso Rabada to slip. Quinton de Kock dived in front of Hashim Amla and spilled the chance."
"9.30am Steven Smith has won the toss and Australia will bat Abbott to Finch, OUT bowled im. One down already. Too exuberant from Finch. But a beautiful delivery too. The perfect delivery to Finch, akin to Southee's ball against Finch in Auckland. Full, just outside off, and so Finch thinks he can hit on the up. But the ball jags back just enough to go through a massive gap between bat and pad. Sends the off stump for a walk. Magnificent start for SA. Abbott to Warner, OUT one more. Abbott has another. What a jaffa. Australia's openers have been bowled in 13 balls. Continues to be full on off and middle, but this tails back exaggeratedly. Goes through a gap between bat and pad again, and disturbs the stumps. Warner visibly late in picking the movement. Superb start from Abbott. Pretorius to Bailey, OUT Bailey gone now. Australia in all sorts. Bailey doesn't review, and rightly so. Plumb in front. Good length on off and middle. Bailey sees the length and stays back, but should have come forward because of the variable bounce. It keeps low, jags back in and pins Bailey plumb in front. Didn't have much chance once he hung on that back foot Shamsi to Smith, OUT quite close. Big appeal, but too much doubt, I'd say. Faf and his close fielders have a chat, and he decides to review. Nice flight outside off from Shamsi, it turns back in and hits Smith in front of off. This could be closer than I thought initially. No bat. Umpire's call? rRemember, there is a new lbw protocol. in force. Those new lbw rules aren't needed because it struck him in front of off and hits o Shamsi to Head, OUT one more! Shamsi has two in three. Another one for SA. Head has a chat with his partner and opts not to review. Australia in tatters now. Another orthodox delivery, flat on off. The ball spins a touch and beats Head's outside edge to strike him in front of off. Was there too much spin? Would it have been umpire's call? Head did not pick either delivery. Australia have been left befuddled by a few deliverie Shamsi to Hastings, OUT Shamsi returns and strikes! Tossed up nicely and spins back into the right-hander. Hastings has a short stride as he looks to defend with a straight bat. He, however, looks to defend outside the line. Shami beats him on the inside and raps the front pad below the knee-roll in front of middle. The finger goes up, and Hastings knew he was gone. Din't bother to review. The tracker shows that it would take Phangiso to Wade, OUT Phangiso belts out an appeal for lbw, it's given! Wade wants a review, more out of hope rather than conviction. He's also Australia's last hope. Pushed through from over the wicket, starts outside off, and spins in. Wade goes low for the sweep and misses. Struck on the thigh in line with the stumps. The tracker shows it would hit the leg stump Phangiso to Boland, OUT Phangiso strikes the pad, again! Draws another leg-before appeal. The bowler isn't sure. Qdk insists on a review, and Faf goes for it. Inside edge? Replays show pad first! Tossed up full, drifts in. Straightens enough. It would have hit middle. Australia have been dismissed for 167 SA rested three-first choice bowlers but still wiped out Australia for 167 in 36.4 overs. Abbott led the way with the new ball before Shamsi, the left-arm wristspinner, took over and ended with career-best returns of 3 for 36. The story could have been worse for the visitors if not for fifities from Wade and Marsh. We'll be back soon for the chase. 1pm And we're back. Qdk and Amla are out in the middle. Can Tremain find some movement with the new ball? Over the wicket, one slip Tremain to de Kock, 1 wide Tremain retorts with a bouncer angling away from Qdk. Soars to the keeper. Too high and called a wide Hastings to du Plessis, 1 leg bye good length on middle and off, Faf shuffles across and misses his flick. Struck right in front, but very high. A leg bye ensues Zampa to Duminy, OUT straight to mid-off. I just despise that shot, but these guys apparently don't. Tossed up on off, Duminy tries to clear mid-off. Doesn't quite get underneath and ends up chipping his wicket away after doing all the hardwork. All he had to do was try to go straight and the margin of error increases multi-fold. Nonetheless, Marsh takes a simple reverse-cupped catch 4.20pm Rossouw raises his bat, the crowd laps him up. Faf claps the batsmen off. SA rested as many as three first-choice bowlers, but still wiped out Australia for 167 inside 37 overs. Abbott led the way with the new ball, Shamsi with the older one. Stand-in captain Faf then anchored the modest chase with his second fifty-plus score of the series. The hosts are now set for a whitewash of Australia. Can they become the first team to South Africa won by 6 wickets (with 87 balls remaining) Player of the match is Kyle Abbott, SA","South Africa 168 for 4 (du Plessis 69, Rossouw 33*) beat Australia 167 (Wade 52, Marsh 50, Abbott 4-40, Shamsi 3-36) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australian hand-wringing about taking an under-strength bowling attack to South Africa was placed in sharp perspective on a breezy morning in Port Elizabeth. Facing a South African side resting three first-choice bowlers in a dead rubber, Steven Smith's side were shot out for a mere 167 to set-up a six-wicket win. Kyle Abbott and Tabraiz Shamsi were the chief tormentors of the tourists, the former finding exactly the right length to best use the early movement on offer, the latter re-opening the sorts of wounds inflicted by Sri Lanka's spin bowlers on Australia's previous tour with a clever spell of left arm wrist-spin. Neither had been needed in the live matches. Save for a 50 by Mitchell Marsh and a punchy contribution from Matthew Wade, the most notable moment for Australia was Wade's running battle with Shamsi."
"Pretorius to Finch, SIX runs pitched up and fetched into the crowd, another breezy tinkle over the fence from Finch, walloped into the crowd at long-on (well caught, too) and that takes him to an even quicker half-century, from 32 balls Tahir to Finch, OUT launched into the sky, but it lobs to mid-off, Tahir makes the breakthrough! One big hit too many for Finch, sent it pretty much straight up and he has to head straight off, as Tahir weaves away in trademark arms-whirling high-fiving celebration. Twas the googly that did it Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 wide a loopy bouncer which is called wide Phehlukwayo to Warner, 1 wide pushed down the leg side, de Kock does well to get his right-hand mit down to it Rabada to Bailey, 1 wide 140kph but fired down the leg side Rabada to Bailey, 1 wide loses his line down the leg side once again Rabada to Smith, 1 wide digs this in, very short and slightly leg side, Smith watches it through Phehlukwayo to Bailey, OUT got him, brilliant catch in the covers! Lucky's slower ball does the trick, though Bailey must have thought he'd collared it, opening the shoulders and slapping in front of square, only for du Plessis to hurl himself to his left and cling on to a pearler two-handed Steyn to Smith, SIX runs dismissively done, the arms windmilling through, Smith takes a length ball from off stump and swings it high over deep square leg... Not the way to make friends with Dale Steyn Steyn to Marsh, OUT short ball, Marsh cracks a pull... only to be bagged by another great catch at midwicket! Miller the man on this occasion, diving low to his left and clinging on to give Steyn a wicket and just check Australia's momentum a fraction Steyn to Smith, OUT bowled him, Smith misses a slower ball! He tucks his bat under his arm and walks off, a fantastic knock but he won't go any further... Made a bit of room and was looking to steer through the covers, done by the lack of pace as Steyn sent a cutter into off stump Marsh to de Kock, SIX runs that's de Kock at his best! Another slower ball, full outside off, he picks it and drives it clear over long-off...handsome way to reach three figures Tremain to de Kock, OUT touch short and de Kock pulls, h-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-g-e top edge and it swirls above Worrall coming in at fine leg... but he holds on! It was a spectacular take in the end, diving flat out because he was slightly out of position. The burly fast bowler proves he has good hands and that's a massive wicket for Australia Zampa to Duminy, 1 leg bye another lbw appeal, Wade joining in this time, the ball deflects behind point... pitched outside again? Zampa to Miller, 1 wide pushes this one down the leg side into Wade's pads Hastings to Duminy, OUT slapped high into the leg side - but he's picked out the man on the rope! Oh dear, not sure what Duminy was thinking there, a short break in play and that's the partnership scuppered. Swung across the line and Finch barely had to move, a step to the left and clutched to his chest Marsh to Miller, 1 wide that's a very short bouncer which loops over Miller's head Marsh to Miller, SIX runs that's big! Gets underneath a full ball and launches it straight down the ground...in the arc and he swung the line Hastings to Miller, 1 wide over the wicket now, and fired way outside off stump...the wides are stacking up Zampa to Phehlukwayo, SIX runs maybe Miller just said smash it! That's what he's done. Zampa dragged that down horribly and Lucky as pulled it over deep midwicket. Hastings to Phehlukwayo, 1 leg bye goes for the pull, off the body again towards the keeper...South Africa won't care how they come You did think that when de Kock and Rossouw went in quick succession that the task would be too much for South Africa. Remember, too, that Miller picked up an injury early in his innings but he kept his cool so well. He knew he could find the boundary when needed. Has to be said, however, that Australia's fielding fell apart towards the end South Africa won by 4 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Miller, SA","South Africa 372 for 6 (Miller 118*, de Kock 70) beat Australia 371 for 6 (Warner 117, Smith 108, Finch 53) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:59 By the Numbers: South Africa's second-highest successful chase David Miller's third ODI hundred helped South Africa pull off the second-highest chase of all time and seal the series against Australia with two matches to spare. Miller has chosen not to play his domestic cricket at the Durban-based Dolphins this summer but thrilled his former home crowd during the highest successful chase at Kingsmead with a heroic knock that will become the stuff of legend. In the 31st over, with Miller on 26 and South Africa needing to score at more than eight runs an over, he tweaked a groin muscle running between the wickets. At the start of the next over, South Africa lost their fifth wicket and their last specialist batsmen when JP Duminy holed out. They were 217 for 5 and victory was 155 runs away."
"Hastings to de Kock, OUT a big heave down the ground, it looks elegant enough, but he's not middled it at all! Right off the toe, a gentle back-pedal at mid-on, and Australia have the breakthrough! Hastings to Rossouw, OUT shortish and Rossouw pulls, sends it swirling into the Joburg atmosphere - taken at deep square leg! Not the most calculated of risks, looked like a long boundary out that direction and it was well short of carrying, Hastings again the bowler to strike. Looks like it was a cross-seamer that did for Rossouw... and a bit of a lucky take Hastings to Duminy, 1 wide bouncer, welcome to the jungle, 133kph but trampolining through... too high Tremain to Behardien, OUT heaved hard and violently out to deep midwicket! Tremain has his maiden ODI wicket, and it's come at a vital moment! Got right under the shot and gave Warner several decades to contemplate the ball as it fell back to earth. But he judged it just fine and South Africa's charge still hasn't quite materialised Hastings to Miller, OUT chopped hard out to point, and a tumbling stop ... in fact, it's a catch! Zampa reacted so calmly that no-one really noticed it was out. The umpires are taking a look, and lo and behold, the ball buried in his breadbasket! Time is called on Miller Time... Rabada to Warner, 1 leg bye Rabada's burning rubber with these wheels, 146kph and hitting the pads, possibly too high and the ball flies to slip... whose throw is then tipped past midwicket by Rabada in his follow through, gifting a single Rabada to Warner, 1 wide banged in but down the leg side Steyn to Smith, OUT fired down leg, thick inside edge... WHADDACATCH!!! Steyn gets Smith, though he has de Kock to thank, he flew to his left to hold the chance one-handed, before tumbling and rising in delight to be mobbed by his team-mates. Smiffy's gotta go, via to a worldie from Quinny Steyn to Bailey, 1 wide welcomes the new man with a bumper, Bailey bails out early... too high Rabada to Warner, 1 wide short and slightly leg side, Warner flicks and misses Parnell to Bailey, OUT bowled him, off stump pegged back! The pressure was building on Bailey and he went for the big shot, aiming down the ground but it wasn't quite there, seamed a fraction and he played around it as Parnell hit the bull's eye. Parnell then starts dabbing in celebration... that or he's short-circuiting Parnell to Marsh, 1 leg bye goes round the wicket to the right-hander again, worked away off the pads Parnell to Warner, 1 leg bye slightly short, on the hips and worked around the corner for one - maybe off the padding Phehlukwayo to Warner, SIX runs panned high and hard into the stands! Warner isn't giving up the chase just yet! Shorter this time, and climbed alarmingly off the seam, but he was on the back foot and ready to give it everything. Shot. And suddenly a fine over goes for four, six! Rabada to Hastings, 1 leg bye fired in, sliding towards leg, deflects off the pad as Hastings stays back Parnell to Hastings, SIX runs and again, this time a cross-batted mow down the ground! Not all that short from Parnell but Hastings rocked back and bullocked a swipe over long-on Phehlukwayo to Zampa, 1 wide nippy bouncer, flying through above the bat as Zampa throws himself at it - he's only a little guy and that was above head height Player of the match is Faf du Plessis, SA","South Africa 361 for 6 (du Plessis 111, Duminy 82, Rossouw 75) beat Australia 219 (Head 51, Warner 50, Parnell 3-40) by 142 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A decade after the most high-scoring ODI in history, the Wanderers witnessed something far less competitive. South Africa's batsmen overwhelmed Australia for the second time in as many matches, despite the visiting captain winning the toss and choosing to chase on a Wanderers pitch brimful of runs. The final margin of 142 runs was South Africa's second-biggest over Australia. Where at Centurion it had been Quinton de Kock handing out the punishment, here it was the captain Faf du Plessis who prospered, helped either side of his innings by strong contributions by Rilee Rossouw and JP Duminy. Their innings ensured a difficult day for the Australian pace debutants Joe Mennie and Chris Tremain, who were taken for 160 runs between them in 20 overs."
"Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 wide very full and wide outside off, 143.5ks, too wayward. The keeper collects the ball almost in front of first slip. Wide called Amir to Smith, 1 leg bye 141.8s, full inswinger from Amir, pins him on the pad as Smith shuffles across. Did it straighten enough? I don't think so. Not given by Illingworth too. Misbah challenges the on-field decision. Leg-side Hotspot picks up nothing. Nothing on Snicko. It pitched outside leg. Let's move on. But it was a fine delivery from Amir, getting this to nibble back in after tes Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 leg bye Smith shuffles across and diverts it off the pad square on the leg side Wahab Riaz to Maddinson, OUT Wahab strikes again. Maddinson adds only one to his tally after being dropped at short leg. His first two Test scores do not read pretty: 0, 1. Back of a length and outside off, kicks up and away from the left-hander off the pitch. The Gabba track has quickened up on the second day. He fends at it feebly, sticking his bat out on the back foot, and feeds an edge Amir to Wade, OUT Azhar clings onto this catch in front of his mid-riff. Wade also falls caught behind. Back of a length and holds its line wide outside off Amir to Starc, OUT Smart overhead catch from Shafiq at first slip. Short of a length and outside off, Starc flashes at it. Sends a thick outside edge flying behind. Shafiq collects it, two wickets in two overs for Amir Amir to Hazlewood, OUT Another excellent overhead catch from Shafiq at first slip. Dug in short and wide outside off, Hazlewood too slashes an outside edge behind. Shafiq keeps his eyes on the fast-travelling ball. Moves to his left, leaps, and snaffles it. There are Amir's best figures since his comeback Yasir Shah to Lyon, OUT Yasir finally breaks the last-wicket stand. He finishes with only two wickets. Could have had four or even five. Australia have been dismissed for 429. Tossed up higher, Lyon flicks, but can't keep it down. Shafiq pouches another catch, this one simpler than the ones at slips. Taken at midwicket 4.35pm Australia are already out in the middle, waiting for Pakistan's openers. Starc is ready with the new ball. Azhar and Aslam now walk out. Over the wicket with three slips and a gully Hazlewood to Babar Azam, 1 leg bye very full, hoops back into the right-hander. Azam falls over as he plays across the line, and is struck flush on the front boot. Probably heading down with the sharp angle and swing. Given as a leg bye. The tracker confirms it was heading past leg stump Hazlewood to Sami Aslam, 1 leg bye follows it with a full ball, Sami is hanging back aiming for a flick. Takes it on the pad, drifting down leg Hazlewood to Babar Azam, OUT Hazlewood returns and takes down Azam. He had left the previous ball, flashes at this one. Full and wide, on a set of stumps outside off, and nips away further. Azam drives hard, throwing his bat at the ball. Grazes the outside edge, and Smith turns his body into a side-on position, and collects it to his right at second slip. Tucks the ball up beside his chest. Bird to Sami Aslam, OUT Aslam walks down and across the off stump and exposes the leg stump. He loses his patience. Bird angles a full ball down the leg side. Aslam glances and does not get enough bat on it. Tickles it down leg to Wade. Australia's quicks are razing Pakistan's batting line-up under lights at the Gabba. The opener falls off his 100th ball Bird to Amir, OUT big appeal. No says the umpire. Steven Smith reviews. Bird has no idea. But there is a huge blotch on the inside edge. Bird was getting some movement in the over, this one nips back in from a good length. Amir is cut in half, and the ball snicks the inside edge. Just a faint edge, but very discernible. Amir cannot believe the decision. Hit the bat and the elbow on its way Australia have not enforced the follow-on. Warner and Renshaw scamper off. Innings Start Spin, here's Lyon","Australia 429 (Smith 130, Handscomb 105, Wahab 4-89, Amir 4-97) and 5 for 202 dec (Khawaja 74, Smith 63) beat Pakistan 142 (Sarfraz 59*) and 450 (Shafiq 137, Azhar 71, Starc 4-119) by 39 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Pakistan's bid for a world-record chase fell a mere 40 runs short, allowing Australia to exhale after coming close to coughing up a match they had dominated over the first four days and nights at the Gabba. Asad Shafiq's sublime century and sturdy support from Yasir Shah took Steven Smith's men close to their wit's end, but a Mitchell Starc short ball did for Shafiq when the visitors needed only 41 runs to steal the most fanciful of victories. Three balls later, Smith struck the final blow, running out Yasir from slip after the No. 10 wandered out of his crease, ending a match that had seemed destined for a much wider margin. Starc's speed and direction were vital throughout, and it remains to be seen whether the huge number of overs bowled by him and Josh Hazlewood will have an impact on their physical preparation for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne."
"de Grandhomme to Bailey, OUT soft ball, soft dismissal. Spooned to midwicket. Early Christmas present for Santner and de Grandhomme. Good length holds its line on off, the batsman perhaps plays a bit early and lobs a simple catch. Santner did not even have to budge de Grandhomme to Marsh, OUT De Grandhomme strikes twice in three balls. Marsh could consider himself unlucky. Just short of a good length and on off stump. Marsh is cramped for room as he aims to punch through the covers. But he is stapled to the crease He manages a thick inside-edge, which hits the front leg and then ricochets onto the top of the stumps de Grandhomme to Warner, 1 wide sprays it down the leg side and the wicketkeeper who is standing up to the stumps, does well to get down to his right and cut it off Santner to Head, OUT pre-meditated. Good delivery from Santner. Head moves across perhaps looking for an expansive shot through the off side. But Santner gets it to drift away from around the stumps and Head is far away from the line of the ball as a result. It does not turn much either, so he can't get anywhere close to it and the ball crashes into the stumps Santner to Wade, OUT Wade pre-meditates a slog-sweep. Santner is smart with his variations in pace. He held this back, 78ks. Wade gets it high on the bat and holes out to deep midwicket Southee to Warner, 1 wide sprayed wide outside off, Warner reaches out, but can't make contact Boult to Faulkner, OUT full and just outside off, Faulkner plonks his front leg forward and swings early, slower delivery from Boult. The batsman skies a catch to long-on David Warner, the man of the moment: It was one of those wickets that was two- paced (Your captain said it was one hell of a knock?). The odd one was skidding through. With a couple of wickets down, we had to knuckle down. The miles in the legs; that is what we do. I am ready to go and defend the target. I think 264 is enough. The hosts were pinned down to 4 for 73, but Warner rode out the tough phase, and shifted gears in the slog overs. In the process, he raised his seventh ODI century of the year. Only Tendulkar has more centuries in a year than Warner. 6.35pm Hello again. Guptill and Latham are out to open for NZ. Starc takes the new ball for the hosts. He is backed up by two slips to add to a backward point and a square point Starc to Latham, 1 wide leg-side wide, swinging down leg Faulkner to Williamson, OUT and the on-field decision stays. It was a short of good length ball that was angling. Williamson moved across to get outside the line of the ball and flick it away to the leg side. But he perhaps moved away too much and ended up playing around the pad and the ball hits the front pad. Nigel Llong raised his finger but Williamson reviews it. Only w Head to Guptill, OUT oh, what a catch! It's Bailey this time. Didn't fling himself full length like Smith in the previous match, but it was a remarkable catch nonetheless and very tough. It was fuller outside and Guptill could not keep his drive along the ground. The ball lobs over the head of Bailey at short cover and he leaps up to snaffle it. Timed his jump to perfection Head to Watling, OUT an appeal for lbw, not given. Did it straighten enough? It may have pitched outside leg. Smith and Head converge and challenge the on-field call. RTS does not detect an inside edge. It pitched in line, hitting off stump. Three reds flash on the big screen. Umpire Llong's on-field call is reversed. Watling attempted to sweep again, but made no contact th Starc to Munro, OUT rip-roaring reverse-swinging yorker. Late inward shape for the fast bowler. Clatters into the leg stump. Every time Smith wants to break the stand, he turns to Starc, and his bowler delivers. Munro attempts a whip or a drive, and is beaten for pace. The ball shot through even before the left-hander could bring his bat down Cummins to Boult, OUT oh, what a way to finish! It's Smith again. Took a stunner in the previous game. This one's as good if not better than the one in the previous ODI. He dived to his left on that occasion Travis Head - Fantastic. Great opportunity, the last three games. We've played fantastically, especially after the last couple of months we've had, it feels great to win. I feel in good touch. Probably did not sum up the conditions as well as I would have liked to. It was a slow wicket. Happy that I was able to help win the game with the ball as well. Pat Cummins - Absolutely, it was actually a little tougher today. David Warner played an unbelievable innings and it feels great to finish 3-0. Can't wait to get out there and bowl a few deliveries. I think on a wicket like this, it's a bit slow and there is not going to be much boundaries, so we had to stop the singles, which is something we pride ourselves in doing. It seems lik Warner - It's a team performance. Credit to the bowlers for coming out and executing the plans. Us as batsmen, we had to relay the message and they did extremely well. My first coach of cricket until I was about 16 or 17 passed away, my condolences to his family. I would like to hope my form is getting better, but I need to keep hitting the nets and work harder. That's it from us for this game then. Australia have been clinical with bat and ball throughout the series and deservedly end with a 3-0 scoreline that is a fairly accurate representation of the teams' performances. Meanwhile, India are going strong in their reply to England's 400 in the fourth Test in Mumbai. Just about half an hour left in the day, so stay tuned. Until next time Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 8 for 264 (Warner 156, Boult 3-49) beat New Zealand 147 (Guptill 34, Starc 3-34) by 117 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Different crowd, different context, similar result. Australia returned to the scene of their 2015 World Cup final hiding of New Zealand and duly inflicted another enormous defeat on the visitors, completing the first clean sweep of a Chappell-Hadlee series in a decade, in front of a far smaller gathering than last time. Only 20,591 spectators were on hand to see the heavy lifting done by the vice-captain David Warner, who soared to his second ODI hundred in as many innings and seventh of the year, in conditions far more challenging than those prepared for either of the first two matches of the series. Warner's innings was all the more laudable for the fact that most batsmen found scoring difficult on a slow and capricious pitch. After his 156, the next best score on either side was a doughty supporting hand of 37 by Travis Head, part of the only century stand of the match."
"Santner to Finch, 1 wide drifts this back into middle and leg, Finch attempts a sweep and manages a glove. The keeper fluffs a relatively simple chance. Wide called Santner to Finch, OUT so the dropped chance didn't cost them much. Finch looks to play a predetermined sweep. Was across a long way even before the ball was delivered, so he was in no position to sweep that full delivery. He swung through way too early as well as the ball sneaked through to crash into de Grandhomme to Warner, OUT the party's over. Good, low catch from Williamson at cover. This was full, Warner backed away and drilled it inside-out. Williamson stayed low and moved forward swiftly to take it inches from the ground. Applause, salutes for Warner. Super catch to end a super knock. Warner Southee to Smith, OUT as easy as they come for Santner. This was a length ball outside off, Smith went across to play an agricultural heave but only managed to get the outside part of the bat to slice it to deep point. Not even the possibility of another century deterred him from playing his shots. End Southee to Marsh, 1 wide gets the radar wrong, this one slips down the leg side. Southee appealed for caught behind. They've reviewed the decision, but there's no bat Southee to Head, 1 wide wild off-side wide Boult to Wade, OUT bowled'em. No celebration at all from NZ. Good length on middle, Wade eyes a cross-bat slog across the line. He does not touch it. Boult hits the stumps. Rare dot Henry to Marsh, SIX runs half-volley on off, clears his front leg, and launches it over long-off for another monster six Starc to Latham, 1 wide full and sliding down leg, Latham misses a faint little tickle. Scoring opportunity missed. Wide called Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 wide angles back in to whizz past the thigh pad. Some exercise for the umpire Cummins to Neesham, 1 wide Cummins replies with a fiery bumper on middle, Neesham ducks late. Wade jumps and gloves it with one hand. Wide Faulkner to Williamson, SIX runs shot. Williamson needed this breathing space. NZ needed this breathing space. Full on off stump, hits through the line. Held the elbow up and lofted beautifully over mid-off Marsh to Neesham, SIX runs hip-high short ball outside off, Neesham lays into it. Pulls it flat and hard over square leg, Finch had no chance running to his left from deep midwicket. Neesham acknowledges his fifty Hazlewood to Neesham, OUT Hazlewood returns and takes down Neesham. Good length and angling away outside off, from over the wicket, Neesham can't get under it as this isn't as full as he would have liked. Aims a loft, and ends up skewing a catch to Starc moving back from mid-off. Neesham falls for 74, Starc to Santner, 1 wide yorker, swerves down leg, wide Cummins to Southee, OUT pace and bounce does the trick again. Southee was in no position to play a flat-batted pull. The ball got big on him, he was cramped for room and only managed to get a top edge to Bailey, who took a simple catch coming in from midwicket. Faulkner to Watling, OUT how fitting is it for Warner, the centurion, to take the catch? Australia have taken the Chappell-Hadlee series. Watling swings but doesn't get under that full delivery and ends up slicing it towards Warner, who circles around the ball briefly at cover, before settling undernea 10.20pm Australia have bounced back, and how. They lost 5-0 in the ODI series in South Africa. They came back home and were beaten 2-1 in the Tests. The seniors were under pressure here, but have they delivered or what? David Warner made a typically bruising century to set things up along with Steven Smith be Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 5 for 378 (Warner 119, Marsh 76, Smith 72, Head 57) beat New Zealand 262 (Williamson 81, Neesham 74, Cummins 4-41) by 116 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Fourteen years and one month after Nasser Hussain infamously offered Australia first use of a Gabba pitch that proved brimful of Ashes runs, Kane Williamson gambled similarly and was left with an equally bitter taste of defeat, surrendering the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy in the process. Now, as then, there were mitigating circumstances: the pitch looked to have something in it after rain, and humid, overcast weather suggested apt conditions for swing. But after a couple of useful early deliveries things cleared for Australia's batsmen; so much so that they accelerated to the team's second highest total on home soil. David Warner and Steven Smith set a platform that a supercharged Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh took full advantage of, leaving Williamson's visitors to chase in hope rather than expectation. Granted so many runs to defend, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc all put in strong stints, while Head's part-time off spin was frugal."
"Neesham to Bailey, OUT umpire Dharmasena checking if it has carried. That looked like it did. The third umpire is being called. Soft signal is out. Bailey trudging off. Goes in cleanly. And that will be the end of Bailey. Quite a terrible delivery, full down leg. Bailey gets a little bit of bat on that, carries low to Watling's lef Neesham to Head, 1 wide another wide. Down leg, and Head misses his flick. Ferguson to Smith, (no ball) no no no. Another no-ball. Humongous no-ball. Overstepped. Short on off, pulled to midwicket Ferguson to Smith, 1 wide 144.1ks, dug short and angled down leg, Smith swerves inside the line. Pace can be your best friend. Pace can be your enemy too. Leg-side wide Boult to Head, OUT Boult returns and finds a way past Smith and Head. He dives to his right from his follow-through and plucks out a smart, low catch with both hands. Full and angled in on off, possibly stopped a bit on the left-hander. He pushes in the air, and ends up lobbing a return catch. Excellent reflex catch Neesham to Wade, SIX runs Wade joins the party in Sydney. Shortish on middle, Wade camps back and pull-swings it, baseball style into the stands beyond midwicket Boult to Smith, OUT Munro hangs onto a skier, Smith walks back to a standing ovation. Rousing reception for Smith from his home crowd. Williamson, Santner, and Guptill also congratulate Smith on his landmark. Back of a length and outside off, Smith has a hack at it, skews it in the air with the bottom hand flying off the bat. Munro Henry to Wade, OUT Wade attempts another scoop, he only deflects it onto the stumps. Nice and full, outside off. Wade, having shuffled across, can't get enough bat on it. The zing bails go flying. He was looking to play it fine of fine leg, who had been brought up Neesham to Starc, OUT polite appeal for caught behind from Watling. Given out by umpire Martell. Did the brush the glove on its way? Or just the helmet? Starc challenges the on-field decision. Big bouncer on middle, the batsman was late on the hook. Grazes the top edge, then the helmet and then flies into the gloves of Watling down Hazlewood to Latham, 1 wide full and wide, 143 kph. Too wide outside off and called Hazlewood to Latham, OUT gone! Another early wicket for Australia. Latham chops on. Good length outside off, fifth-stump channel. Latham looks to prod one into the off side but the ball moves back late. Takes the inside edge and clatters into the stumps. Another opening batsman undone by just a hint of lateral movement. Well bowled Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 wide 141 kph, drifts down leg, wide Hazlewood to Williamson, OUT gone. Huge wicket. Williamson nicks off. Full outside off, the ball holds its shape. Williamson goes after it, looking to drive through the off side. Gets a thick outside edge which carries at head height to Smith at first slip who takes a sharp reverse-cupped catch. NZ lose their best batsman. Zampa to Guptill, SIX runs flighted legbreak outside off, Guptill likes the width and marmalises a six over extra cover. Just skimmed off the middle of the bat. Clears the long boundary with some nonchalance Marsh to Guptill, SIX runs just short of a good length and outside off, baseball-swings it into the stands beyond wide long-on Zampa to Guptill, OUT Guptill has hit a dirty long hop to midwicket. Maxwell leaps, and takes the overhead catch on the second attempt. Guptill drops to his knees in despair. Dragged short and outside off, skids on Guptill pulls it flat and hard. Finds the substitute fielder Zampa to Santner, OUT holes out to Warner at long-on. Dolly catch. With two wickets in five balls, Zampa has tilted it Australia's way. Tossed-up legbreak on off, dips late in its flight. Santner lofts it half-heartedly, the bat turns in his hands, and picks out Warner to perfection, who blows a kiss and celebrates the catch Hazlewood to de Grandhomme, OUT very full, and cuts in, de Grandhomme is stapled to the crease as he plays across the line. The ball skids on to rap his front pad plumb in front of middle. No signs of an inside edge. Umpire Dharmasena's finger goes up. The batsman reviews more out of hope rather than conviction. He has no hope at a Marsh to Henry, 1 wide wide yorker outside off, too wide, according to the umpire. Henry reaches out and does not connect 10pm It was Smith's day at the SCG. He was reprieved on 13, and 152, and went on to rack up 164 - the highest individual score at this venue. His century and Head's half-century propelled Australia to 324 for 8 from 92 for 4. Smith then pulled off a scorching catch when he barely had any time to react to send back Watling. Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 8 for 324 (Smith 164, Head 52) beat New Zealand 256 (Guptill 114, Hazlewood 3-49) by 68 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For the first time this summer, Steven Smith could do no wrong. In the Tests against South Africa, he didn't win a single toss, didn't manage a hundred, didn't lead his side to a victory until the series was dead. But a change of format and opposition brought a change of fortunes. Smith won the toss, plundered for himself the highest ODI score ever made at the SCG, then took a truly remarkable catch as Australia secured a 1-0 lead in the Chappell-Hadlee series. There were other highlights in a match that finished as a 68-run victory for Australia."
"9pm A career-best 80 from Wade and some Maxwell magic has lifted Australia to 186. India were sloppy in the field, dropping multiple catches, but Natarajan and Thakur were impressive with their variations in the end overs, reining Australia in. Have Australia got enough to avoid a 3-0 sweep? Alex will be back in a bit to launch the chase. Tye to Thakur, SIX runs flicked over backward square into the crowd! Length but in the slot! He set himself and used the bottom hand to lift it over deep square Here are some of the match highlights if you're tuning in from the Indian subcontinent or the US: Player of the match is Mitchell Swepson, AUS","Australia 186 for 5 (Wade 80, Maxwell 54, Sundar 2-34, Natarajan 1-33) beat India 174 for 7 (Kohli 85, Swepson 3-23, Zampa 1-21) by 12 runs Mitchell Swepson's variations and Adam Zampa's control on a used SCG pitch threw India's pursuit of 187 off track and denied them a 3-0 sweep in the T20I series. Swepson did not concede a single boundary and took out three of India's top five while senior legspinner Zampa returned in the 18th over to effectively kill the chase by drawing a top edge from previous match-winner and finisher Hardik Pandya. ALSO WATCH: Match highlights - Kohli smashes 85, but Wade, Maxwell set up win for Australia (India subcontinent only) Virat Kohli was reprieved at least three times, on a day where both sides' fielding veered from ordinary to extraordinary, but he couldn't turn his 85 off 61 balls into a match-winning effort.

"Maxwell to Bell, 1 bye what happened there? Went for the reverse-sweep again, but it was too full for that. Goes with the angle, misses his pads, narrowly misses off stump, and bounces off the keeper's gloves into the leg side Henriques to Taylor, OUT gone! That was full on off stump, and Taylor goes for the drive over extra cover, he's too close to the pitch of the ball and ends up toe-ending it and hitting it in the air, straight to mid-off Faulkner to Bell, 1 wide slower ball, very wide, hits the wide line on the full and Bell has no option but to leave Sandhu to Bell, 1 leg bye slower ball on the pads, tucked away towards square leg Sandhu to Bell, OUT that is that. The slower ball ends Bell's innings. He comes down the track, Sandhu bowls it shorter, and he goes through with the attempted flat-bat smack over mid-off. Hits high on the bat, and it loops to the left of mid-off, from where Starc manages to backtrack and dive to his left to take a smart catch Cummins to Root, 1 wide slower bouncer, Root leans back, looks for the ramp, it's too high for him to connect Cummins to Root, OUT gone! That's a length ball outside off, it was there to be hit, but Root, clearing his front leg, couldn't get any elevation on it, and he ended up popping it straight into mid-on's hands Faulkner to Bopara, 1 leg bye full, follows Bopara who's looking to step away and make room. Misses the flick and it bounces off his front pad towards backward square leg Faulkner to Buttler, 1 wide another slower ball, wider outside off this time, was very close to the tramline, and the umpire judges it to be a wide Faulkner to Bopara, 1 wide full and wide, another slower ball. Root swings and misses, and it's close enough to the tramline for the umpire to signal wide Starc to Bopara, OUT bowled him. Bopara had taken guard outside off stump, exposing all of his stumps, and Starc bowled him around the legs, clattering the base of leg stump with a low full-toss that swung from outside leg Ali to Maxwell, 1 wide full and quick, angles this too far down the leg side Anderson to Smith, SIX runs Taken! Finally someone in the crowd shows some sort of fielding skills, after a rebound off his friend's palms, no less. It was a length ball outside off and Smith sent that soaring over long-on Woakes to Haddin, 1 wide Woakes throws a bit of a spanner into Haddin's fifty plans, spearing a wide down the leg side 10.30pm That's all from us, from this highly entertaining game in Hobart. Australia have three wins out of three now, which means they are through to the final. England's defeat gives India a window of hope of reaching the final themselves. Make sure you join us for the next game, whenever that is (I'm pretty bad with itineraries). Until then, ta ta!

Aaron Finch twanged a hamstring as his side fell apart under the pressure of a chase for the second time in as many matches. The game evolved in a near action replay of the opening match in Adelaide, as Australia were unable to capitalise on a strong start by Finch and Shaun Marsh in pursuit of a strong Indian total built upon the batting of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Steven Smith and David Warner are set to fly to New Zealand on Saturday, leaving a considerable leadership vacuum should Finch be unfit for the third T20 in Sydney on Sunday. His likely absence may at least mean an opportunity for Usman Khawaja, the outstanding batsman of the summer so far."
"Watson to Raina, 1 wide change of pace slides down leg with Raina moving across to off stump. Wide called Starc to Raina, OUT he's thrown it away! It was a fuller delivery outside off and Raina got on the front foot and hacked it straight at mid-on. And you know what happens when Australia get an opening... Cummins to Ashwin, 1 leg bye gets across on off stump to try and pick the length ball off his toes. Appeal from Cummins for leg before but that would have gone down leg Starc to Dhoni, OUT his penultimate over of the match and he secures a huge strike for Australia. The offcutter has very little room but Dhoni wants to slice it. Gets a thick inside edge and it crashes into the stumps Starc to Axar Patel, OUT there goes another domino! Spearing yorker strikes the back leg with Akshar playing all around it. Would that have missed leg? Beaten for pace, beaten for movement and India are slipping Starc to Ashwin, 1 leg bye wanders away outside off to try a scoop, but Starc bowls it too full for Ashwin to get under. Has to settle for a leg bye Starc to Bhuvneshwar, OUT cleaned him up! that's six! Changed the angle of delivery and came around the wicket to Bhuvi, the new batsman. It was full, it was speared in on middle. The batsman stayed beside the ball to open up the off side, but fails to connect with his shovel drive. Starc smile might as well translate as 'you miss, I hit' Yadav to Finch, 1 wide this one's pretty wide too and swings away further outside off for a wide Yadav to Finch, 1 leg bye drifts towards the pads now from back of of length, deflects it down behind square for a leg bye Ashwin to Watson, SIX runs fluent movement towards the pitch of the ball and Watson unleashes impressive power to slam the good length ball into the sightscreen. Pressure on Ashwin straight away Ashwin to Smith, 1 leg bye beats him in flight, or lack of it, as Smith steps forward to flick a good length delivery through midwicket. Sneaks between bat and pad and to third man for a single Raina to Finch, 1 wide surprise, surprise, a slider down leg. Finch can't connect with the sweep, but will take the wide Raina to Finch, 1 wide down the leg side and it misses Finch's shovel sweep. Wide though Yadav to Bailey, 1 wide that's the 10th wide of the innings. Slipping down leg as Bailey fails to connect with the leg glance Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs down the track and pummels a length ball over the straight boundary. Clean ball-striking Axar Patel to Faulkner, 1 leg bye full and fired in on leg stump, Faulkner is struck on the pads and weathers a huge lbw appeal. Would be sliding down leg ""The ball's coming out wlel and Australia's winning games. Great to contribute and it was a team effort. Picked up key wickets.Rohit batted well, but Finchy played well and Faulkner's finished it for us. I was a bit nervous, still am standing with pads on talking to you"" says Mitchell Starc, the Man of the Match for the second match in a row ""A lot depends on conditions, about how the wicket is behaving, specially with drop-in wickets. Also the dew factor, today there wasn't any. But if it was it becomes difficult to contain and then the composition of the attack. On the higher end of 270, should be defended because the bowlers will get extra bounce and will reverse.

The eighth of India's innings and the first of Pandya's career began with three consecutive wides down leg side as Steven Smith walked inside the line, and two more followed later in the over. It meant the over lasted 11 deliveries, and given that a six and a four came off two of the legal balls, he finished with figures of 1-0-19-0 and five wides."
"Cummins to Bopara, 1 wide short ball down the leg side for a wide Cummins to Morgan, (no ball) oh, that must have slipped out of his hand! It was a beamer well over Morgan's head, but wide too outside off and it went straight to Watson at slip, who dropped it! Given a no ball, not wide Doherty to Bopara, OUT another bowler has struck in his first over, Bopara gone this time! It was short outside off, Bopara went back and cut it straight to Maxwell at backward point for a straightforward catch Doherty to Morgan, 1 wide strays down the leg side for a wide Doherty to Morgan, SIX runs charges down the track to take it on the full and lofts it down the ground over long off for six to bring up his fifty Faulkner to Buttler, OUT one more for Faulkner, he gets Buttler this time! Angled it across outside the off stump, Buttler drove it up and high in the air and Warner at sweeper cover took a couple of steps to take a simple catch Cummins to Morgan, 1 wide slower bouncer goes over Morgan and it's called a wide Maxwell to Woakes, OUT Woakes has given it away! Pretty innocuous delivery on middle and leg, Woakes went back and worked it to leg but in the air and straight to midwicket for an easy-peasy catch Cummins to Jordan, 1 wide slower bouncer on middle and leg, Jordan ducks under it Cummins to Morgan, 1 wide length delivery down the leg side for a wide Faulkner to Jordan, OUT another one caught in the deep and Jordan has given it away. Short on middle and leg and Jordan pulled it straight to Maxwell at deep midwicket Starc to Morgan, SIX runs that's big, that's another six, his third of the innings! Made room for the incoming delivery, it was full too, he was well in the crease and lofted it high over the long on boundary for six Starc to Morgan, OUT another easy catch for Maxwell, this time Morgan's gone but after such a counter-attacking innings. He middled this short ball on middle stump with the pull but found Maxi at deep midwicket. What a fighting innings from the captain Starc to Finn, OUT started the innings with a wicket, and ends with one too! He came round the wicket and darted a yorker right on the off stump, Finn missed it and was bowled first ball Ali to Smith, 1 wide strays down the leg side for a wide Woakes to Maxwell, OUT there's a loud appeal for caught behind and he's gone! It was a fullish delivery outside off, Maxi poked without much footwork, the keeper and bowler went up and so did the umpire's finger! But replays and HotSpot confirm there was no edge, the sound was of the bat hitting the ground 9.35pm What was going to be an easy win turned out to be stressful as Australia chased the bonus point. The target wasn't that steep on this pitch and Warner's hundred made sure they got there within 40 overs to start the series on a great note. What actually set it up for them was two wickets in the first three balls of the Time for the presentation: Australia won by 3 wickets (with 61 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Starc, AUS","India 4 for 331 (Pandey 104*, Rohit 99, Dhawan 78, Hastings 3-61) beat Australia 7 for 330 (Warner 122, Mitchell Marsh 102*, Bumrah 2-40, Ishant 2-60) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:58 Chappell: Hundred will give Pandey more belief Manish Pandey and MS Dhoni, rising star and fading force, combined to deliver India victory over Australia at the last possible opportunity in another run-fest at the SCG. Having crumpled in a humiliating heap in Canberra, the tourists were able to hold their nerve this time, helped by a pair of critical Australian dropped catches. David Warner and Mitchell Marsh had made centuries for Australia, but the allrounder conceded 13 from the final over of the night to allow the visitors avoid the ignominy of a 5-0 series sweep. It also provided partial vindication of Dhoni's longtime belief in seeing out an innings, even if his steady 34 was a diminished version of supreme closing displays he used to be able to put together for his team. Australia were denied an unbeaten home summer."
"Starc to Finn, 1 wide 142 kph, short and slanted wide down the leg side Maxwell to Bopara, 1 wide floated up full and down the leg side Maxwell to Bopara, 1 wide pitches leg stump and carries down the leg side The Australians get their hands on the series trophy, and that is all from us for the moment. Good bye Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 8 for 278 (Maxwell 95, Marsh 60, Faulkner 50*) beat England 166 (Bopara 33, Maxwell 4-46) by 112 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia served one final ominous warning before the World Cup with a demolition of England's challenge in the final of the triangular series. It is all the more ominous because England had them down at 4 for 60 on an overcast morning, but Australia found a way. Not just to claw back but to dominate. Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh added 141 runs of mindful mayhem for the fifth wicket before James Faulkner unleashed unadulterated mayhem of 50 off 24 balls. The returning Mitchell Johnson then drove the final nail in with a ferocious spell to rip through the England top order."
"WATCH (Indian subcontinent only): Shardul Thakur dismisses Glenn Maxwell with a slower ball Zampa to Iyer, SIX runs a no-look slog wayyyyy over deep midwicket! Full and sliding onto his front leg. He gets to the pitch, watches the ball onto the bat and continues to watch that spot as his perfect bat swing sends this a long way Sams to Hardik, SIX runs slogs it well over deep midwicket! Full and angled into the arc once again from around the wicket. He set up for it, picked that it was back of the hand, and swung cleanly through it.

ALSO WATCH: Match highlights - Natarajan, Hardik seal series for India (India subcontinent only) The Australians were led by Matthew Wade in the absence of Aaron Finch due to injury, and he led from the front with a swift half-century at the top of the order. But the remainder of the Australian innings was spasmodic, and without any of Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood or Mitchell Starc, the bowling attack was well and truly below the usual level of expertise. Kohli, KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan ensured India would be in the contest until its closing passages, whereupon Pandya lined up his scoring zones with brutal efficiency. Daniel Sams was defending 14 from the final over, but with a pair of towering blows beyond the straight midwicket boundary, India claimed the series with two balls to spare."
"Hazlewood to Williamson, 4 leg byes strays onto the pads, Williamson misses out on the flick, but gets four leg-byes for it Hazlewood to Guptill, SIX runs good sharp bouncer, and he has top-edged it for a six. That points to the pace, all right, but also how much the ropes have pulled in. This is not a full-blooded hook. Guptill is cramped for room with this bouncer so he hardly can swing properly, but the top edge flies over Haddin's head for six #MCGsobig Johnson to Guptill, 1 wide wide down the leg side this time. Gets the line a tad wrong. Bowled at 146ks Maxwell to Guptill, OUT what a bowling change. And how much has that miss on that half tracker played on Guptill's mind. Stays back to a ball slightly short than good length. He goes back to play for the offbreak and punch it. The ball turns, but not as much as he is expecting it to. Hits the top of off. Big Show on Big Stage. Also Haddin gets in Guptill's face with his applauding gloves to leave a sour note on what has been Australia's afternoon Johnson to Williamson, OUT Johnson has looked like getting a wicket nearly every ball, and he has done so now. He has bowled excellently. His pace and aggression so far means any slight misbehaviour off the pitch is going to have a big impact. This is a length ball, around that middle and off channel. Previously balls have cut and fizzed away, this stops a touch. Only a touch, mind you. Williamson is early in defending, and lobs this back to Johnson. He is looking to work this to leg, but this has also angled away towards off, which means he has checked his shot a little Starc to Taylor, 1 leg bye hit on the pad as he is beaten by the pace, but this has pitched outside leg Watson to Taylor, 1 wide bouncer, but too short and too high. Called a wide Johnson to Elliott, 1 leg bye short of a length, pitched outside leg, hits him on the thigh pad. Concedes a leg-bye Johnson to Vettori, OUT this is top-quality bowling from Australia. Johnson has come back to completely outdo Vettori. Full inswinging yorker at a high pace. Off the round arm it comes, dipping on him, tailing back in, Vettori is late on it, is beaten on the inside edge, is hit on the pad, and the deflection rattles the stumps Johnson to Southee, SIX runs Sixer Southee has hit a six first ball he faces. First intentional six of the innings/ #MCGsobig. Johnson bowls the slower ball, on a length, and he gets under it to loft it over long-on for a biggie Johnson to Henry, no run bouncer now. Won't be many slower balls around after that six first ball. He has to rush out of its line to protect his head Johnson to Henry, OUT oh that is not the intention but they have got the wicket all the same. This is a yorker gone wrong. A low juicy full toss outside off with all the off-side fielders in the ring. Henry drives, but neither gets power behind it nor manages to keep it down. Easy catch for Starc at cover-point Johnson to Boult, 1 wide tries a bouncer but is way down the leg side. Called a wide Australia lost the toss on a flat MCG pitch, which has resulted in scores of 300 every match and easy defence of those totals. What do they do? Mitchell Starc first bowled an excellent first spell, including yorking Brendon McCullum and bowling him out for a duck in the first over. Josh Hazlewood continued doing his best impression of Glenn McGrath, and Mitchell Johnson brought more pressure with his pace and aggression at first change. Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor then put together a partnership, took New Zealand into the Powerplay only three down, but that's when they ran into Australia's 5.57pm What a top-dog effort from Australia. They have now taken 79 of the 80 wickets available to them. While it will be pointed out that New Zealand's score is the same as India's in the 1983 final, I am sure Australia would have taken this at the start of the game Right now, they don't need to open their mouths. Pointing at the scoreboard will do. If they close this out - as they should - then there'll be no quibbling about who are the rightful champions. Southee to Smith, 1 wide outside off, shapes away, too far Southee to Clarke, 1 wide slams in a fiery bouncer, Clarke flinches as it climbs through - too high, this time Henry to Clarke, 1 wide starts with a back-of-the-hand slower ball, drifts down the leg side Australia will be receiving the trophy shortly, their fifth World Cup. Two years ago, they were being whitewashed in India and going out of the Champions Trophy without a win. Lehmann has helped recapture their mojo, they'll certainly celebrate under the southern cross tonight. And at the end of the Australian summer, after the pain of Phillip Hughes' passing in November, this will also be a cathartic triumph. We've had a blast, haven't we? The batsmen certainly did, though the Man of the Final and Man of the Tournament were bowlers. We will remember spells from Mitchell Starc and Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Wahab Riaz for as long as we do those innings of fury from Martin Guptill, AB de Villiers and Glenn Maxwell. Not to mention the contributions made from all across the cricketing world, from Shaiman Anwar and William Porterfield, Shapoor Zadran and Sean Williams. Australia won by 7 wickets (with 101 balls remaining) Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS","Australia 186 for 3 (Clarke 74, Smith 56*) beat New Zealand 183 (Elliott 83, Johnson 3-30, Faulkner 3-36) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ryan Pierse/Getty Images It had been the World Cup of short balls. On a flat MCG deck, it had seemed bounce would be the bowlers' major ally. But so cocksure were Australia's pace phalanx of their quality, they left nothing to the vagaries of the surface, firing balls full, fast and straight to deliver Australia a seven-wicket win and their fifth World Cup in comprehensive fashion. Mitchell Starc and Mitchell Johnson shared five wickets, having sent down several spells of searing, swinging yorkers between them, and James Faulkner - slower but cannier than the other left-armers - claimed three scalps for himself. In all, eight wickets fell to full deliveries as New Zealand were felled for 183 in the 45th over."
"Yadav to Smith, OUT India get the breakthrough. Smith won't score a double. Yadav bowls a bouncer that finally gets head high. Smith clears the front leg to hook. Doesn't control it. The top edge settles with deep square leg. Smith raises his bat to the crowd as he walks off Yadav to Finch, 1 wide wide down the leg side. A rib-high short ball Yadav to Finch, 1 leg bye angling in, beats the inside edge, concedes a leg-bye Ashwin to Maxwell, OUT Ashwin has bowled well, and he has got the big Maxwell wicket. Good field placings, good courage to bowl slow through the air. The ball turns into the pads, he cannot play it through the off side, and doesn't bother keeping the sweep down. Straight down the lap of deep backward square it goes Yadav to Finch, OUT good sharp short ball. India are clawing back. They could still keep Australia down to a manageable total. Only Yadav has been able to hurry the batsmen with the short ball. Finch is hurried into this again. This is just outside off, chest high, and does him for the pace. The edge is taken, and caught at midwicket. A hard-working Yadav to Watson, 1 wide wide down the leg side. Kettleborough not affected by the appeal for the catch Shami to Faulkner, 1 bye makes room, Shami follows him up with the endangered species - the yorker. Just the single off the inside edge Yadav to Faulkner, OUT Faulkner goes after that cameo. Yadav bowls full and straight. Fuller than a length ball, just short of a yorker. Faulkner swings across the line to go over the leg side. Misses it altogether as it tails back in. Timbah Sharma to Watson, OUT slower ball, in his slot, this time he has picked the slower ball, but he has cramped him for room, and his slog settles with deep square leg. Just can't get enough power behind this shot because there is no rook available Sharma to Clarke, OUT another wicket for India. This is a soft dismissal. A little luck for them. This is a short ball. Not a bouncer. No menace behind this. Only waist high. Clarke can see a four over midwicket, but just doesn't get the elevation he desires. Finds Rohit Sharma there. This is what a break in momentum does to you. Slight uncertainty, Around Smith, today, Finch battled hard, and once a collapse set in around the 35th over, Watson, Faulkner and Johnson played important little hands to help them over 300. This is the first time this World Cup that India haven't bowled out an opposition. They will need to carry all the confidence and the momentum from having held Australia back if they are G'day, folks. Looks like Australia have done what they do. Are we going to need a collective ECG at the SCG? Do India have a Grant Elliott? Can Mitchell Starc make these questions academic inside the Powerplay? We'll find out shortly. For India fans, here's a flashback to 2012 and the scintillating, successful chase against Sri Lanka in Hobart - only 321 b Starc to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye fired in on the stumps, quite full and tailing towards leg, Dhawan tucks it away behind square Hazlewood to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye shortish and ducking back at Sharma, hit on the padding and they hustle one, as Hazlewood tries to get to the ball in his follow through. The umpire comes in quickly to break up any potential afters Johnson to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs banged in and rising at the batsman's head, Rohit meets fire with TNT and hooks Johnson for six well over fine leg! No problems with that short ball, saw it early and scooped it into the crowd Hazlewood to S Dhawan, OUT here comes Shikhar... and there goes Shikhar! He's absolutely skelped this but sends the ball straight into the safe, safe hands of Glenn Maxwell at deep extra cover! Hazlewood roars, clenched fist pumping, they've got their opening. Pitched up outside off, maybe slightly off the toe as Dhawan drove over the infield, only Johnson to Kohli, OUT bouncer from Mitch, top-edged and gone - Kohli has cracked! Slow start, quick end for Virat, took on the Johnson short ball and emphatically lost. It was aimed across him, outside off, attempted to pull and sent a lusty blow straight up, Haddin had time to do a little square dance to his left, opened up the gauntlets and swallo Johnson to Rohit Sharma, OUT bowled him, Johnson strikes back! He leaps up to the skies in celebration, Australia's spearhead has taken out another key batsman, fast and furious, right through Rohit, off the inside edge and lighting up the wicket. Held cross seam, nipped back at pace and clipped the leg bail. Lights are going out for India Starc to Raina, 1 wide slung down very short and called wide... Starc follows through to spit some opinions in Raina's direction. Getting a wee bit feisty out there Starc to Raina, 1 wide fires this well down the leg side, Raina right back on his stumps - another wide Watson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye short and rising sharply enough to catch Dhoni off guard, hits the body and drops to the turf, they take a comfortable leg bye Johnson to Rahane, 1 wide sprayed across the right-hander from over the wicket, shapes to play but doesn't pull the trigger - wide Starc to Rahane, OUT Rahane plays with fire, fiddling at a length ball off the back foot... it slides past the outside edge. No one reacts but Australia then decide to review, not sure on whose prompting. Looks like a gamble, but... While there's no visible deviation, a thin scrape on Snicko is enough for Erasmus, he tells Dharmasena to overturn his Watson to Dhoni, SIX runs six more, down the ground! Watson delivers it in the slot again and Dhoni pounces, huge forearms pumping as he levers another mighty over long-off Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 328 for 7 (Smith 105, Finch 81, Yadav 4-72) beat India 233 (Dhoni 65, Faulkner 3-59) by 95 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Getty Images Four months ago, India arrived in Australia as holders of both the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the World Cup. Then they ran into Steven Smith, who ensured they will fly home with neither. Smith tormented India with a century in every Test of the summer, and like the ghost of series past, returned to haunt them with another hundred in this World Cup semi-final. The summer of Steve just keeps rolling on. It will end at the MCG on Sunday in either World Cup triumph over New Zealand, or heartbreak at losing the trophy to the co-hosts of this six-week event."
"Hazlewood to Sarfaraz, 4 leg byes too straight. Sarf is down the wicket again, Hazlewood strays down the pads, and kisses the pad on the way for four leg-byes Starc to Sarfaraz, OUT say what you will of Watson's batting, he is one of the best slip fielders in the world today. This catch is one for the ages. Slip catches are never easy, but the ones that swerve away from you at the last moment? That too to balls bowled at 150.1ks? Sarfraz just follows this quick length ball with his hands, edges it, looks like he has offered an easy catch to Watto until the ball swings away from him at the last moment. Wa Hazlewood to Shehzad, OUT Pakistan openers are back in the sheds already. Plays a loose shot to a wide length ball. Away from the body with no foot movement. The only thing that moves is the ball. Slightly away from him. Takes a thick edge to the second slip where Clarke takes it easily Hazlewood to Misbah, 1 wide wide down the leg side Johnson to Haris Sohail, 1 wide this is called a wide, but Haddin is smiling. This is a mean bouncer, rising from not too short. Damn quick too. Haris wants to pull but can't reach it. This is clocked at 143ks Maxwell to Misbah, SIX runs tuk tuk goes bang. Every now and then Misbah plays this shot and invariably he connects. Takes this off a length and sends it over deep midwicket. They need these. Can't let Maxwell sneak in soft overs Faulkner to Misbah, 1 leg bye moves right across his stumps, is beaten and hit on the pad, but the ball is pitched outside leg Johnson to Haris Sohail, OUT the bouncer has done the trick. Johnson has produced the loose drive with leaden feet. Look at his back foot move away as he drives. Johnson pushes this one up, angling it across Sohail, who drives away from the body, his back foot moving away from the line of the ball. The edge is taken Johnson to Afridi, SIX runs that's No. 351. Oh Shahid, what an entertainer. Length ball, just outside off, he drives with an open face, Finch thinks he is in business at deep point but it sails over it Hazlewood to Afridi, OUT he has found out deep midwicket. Finch has taken three deep midwicket catches today. Oh that short square boundary, what a temptress. Afridi looks to pull, but the ball is not short enough. He doesn't get all of it, Finch is prowling there, and takes this head high. Is this the last time Lala has paced off the field with gloves and pads on? Hazlewood to Maqsood, OUT good shot but he had found the fielder. Full ball, on off, he knows there is no deep cover, he is looking to drive over the ring, just gets too close to the pitch of the ball, and finds Johnson at cover Starc to Wahab Riaz, OUT Starc is the sole leading wicket-taker this World Cup. Finally he has drawn an edge. Riaz has finally hit that little white thing after backing away from the stumps. The outside edge settles nicely with Haddin Hazlewood to Sohail Khan, OUT Hazlewood ends with four in the quarter-final. Sohail backs away and swings. Gets a massive top edge that goes a million miles and comes down towards gully. Haddin the man with mitts on clears the area, settles under it, keeps his eyes on the swirling ball, and takes a safe catch Maxwell to Umar Akmal, OUT what have you done Umar Akmal? This is a long hop at the Adelaide Oval with short square boundaries. Akmal has enough time to pause, do a quick opinion poll on where to hit this in the stands, and then take a selfie before hitting it. Unfortunately for him, he has found out the one man stationed there. Aaron Finch hasn't had to move an inch. Akmal is disgusted with himself. Smashes the bat into his pad Faulkner to Ehsan Adil, OUT this time it has gone to hand. Faulkner gets a wicket, Starc takes a lovely catch. Clears the front let to pull, gets a top edge towards top edge, Starc rushes in and takes this low and diving forward 5.33pm The Australian bowlers have done their job. Some excellent aggressive bowling from them. Starc is back on top of the tree. Hazlewood has proven his line and length is a better pick than Cummins in a team of two other express quick bowlers. Johnson has shown signs of the return of some of the menace. Maxwell produced two crucial wickets in the middle. Faulkner was exceptional in the batting Powerplay and in the end. When Watson bowls five overs for Sohail Khan to Finch, OUT pitched up, this jags back at Finch and raps him on the pads, Sohail implores for the decision... and Dharmasena gives it! Finch, after a brief conversation with his partner, asks for the review but it only takes a quick look to release this was foolishness. Not much footwork and the ball zipped in with the arm, past the inside edge as he played to leg, and it was crashing into the woodwork halfway up. The finger points sk Wahab Riaz to Warner, 1 wide wild, down the leg side and Warner whirls his arms at a pull in vain Wahab Riaz to Clarke, OUT gottim! The short ball works, Clarke dollies it to forward short leg! Don't you love it when a plan comes together... That was well-directed from Wahab, not quite a snorter but awkward enough for a man with an antique spine, rising towards the helmet grill and Clarke can only pop it up off the splice, floats into the hands of the catcher. Maqsood hurls the ball at the floor and screams in delight. Pakistan are in this Wahab Riaz to Watson, 1 wide short and wanged down the leg side, Wahab losing his line a touch, maybe flagging Rahat Ali to Smith, 1 wide sliding across the batsman, looked just about inside the tramlines... but called wide as Smith ignores it Ehsan Adil to Smith, OUT fuller, on the stumps, Smith flicks and misses - given! Adil's appeal was almost a lone one, though Sarfraz also went up, Dharmasena gave it some thought before raising the finger. Australia have used their review, so Smith has to trudge off, having looked impenetrable for the last couple of hours. Looked like it would have clipped leg, fairly innocuous ball, Smith not quite as focused as he had been Wahab Riaz to Maxwell, 1 wide back of a length again, very leg side... Wahab tiring, I think Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, SIX runs short ball, Maxwell takes the bait, there's a man out there... but he'd need to be in the crowd. Effortless swivel-pulled six to finish the over and kick Pakistan in the bojangles once more Australia won by 6 wickets (with 97 balls remaining) Player of the match is Josh Hazlewood, AUS","Australia 216 for 4 (Smith 65, Watson 64*) beat Pakistan 213 (Haris Sohail 41, Hazlewood 4-35) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Wahab Riaz delivered one of the most fearsome spells in World Cup history but Australia, helped by some shoddy Pakistan fielding, weathered the storm and set up a semi-final showdown with India. Chasing 214 to win this quarter-final, Australia faced trouble at 59 for 3. Wahab delivered a bouncer barrage to Shane Watson but, like a zing bail earlier in the day, Watson wobbled but did not fall, and was there to strike the winning runs. The key moment came when Wahab's efforts led to a top edge from Watson that flew high to fine leg, where Rahat Ali contrived to drop the simplest of chances. Wahab let out a scream, and you could sense all the pressure he had built slowly dissipate."
"1.15pm Afternoon, all. We're 45 minutes from the toss in Hobart, where Australia are taking on Scotland. It's one last opportunity for Scotland to pick up their first World Cup win, and one last opportunity for a few of Australia's players to find some form and momentum ahead of the quarterfinals. Starc to Coetzer, OUT gone! This time it was just back of a length and close enough to off stump for the leaden-footed Coetzer to edge rather than miss as he aimed a massive back-foot punch, looking to go through the covers. Flies to Smith at shoulder height, and he takes it easily Starc to Machan, 1 wide back of a length again, angled too far down the leg side Starc to MacLeod, OUT ouch. That was short, with a little bit of width on it, and MacLeod has played the cut fairly well, but this one he pops into the air, and straight into the hands of backward point Watson to Mommsen, OUT excellent bouncer from Watson, and Mommsen goes second ball. Has to drag the pull from over his right shoulder, and he could only top-edge it to Starc stationed at backward square leg Faulkner to Davey, 1 wide bouncer, Davey gets into a low crouch under it Johnson to Coleman, 1 wide you'd say that's a good bouncer from Johnson if this was Test cricket. He had to pull his hands away from the ball in a hurry. But it was just a fraction down the leg side, and umpires can be merciless sometimes Johnson to Coleman, OUT Johnson gets into the party now. Back of a length, fourth-stump, angling away. No footwork in that attempted back-foot punch, and Clarke dives to his right from second slip to grab the edge, lovely low catch Maxwell to Berrington, OUT and he strikes first ball, with a fairly rubbish ball. It's floated up outside off, it's a half-volley, and Berrington slices his drive in the air, straight to Warner at cover Starc to Davey, OUT clatter. Off-stump yorker, and Davey is late bringing his bat down. It actually straightened a touch and went past the outside edge Starc to Wardlaw, OUT boom, and that off stump takes another beating. It's full and fast and Wardlaw gave himself room to play through the off side, bat was nowhere near it in the end. Again it straightened off the pitch Taylor to Finch, OUT gone! Another drive in the air, but this time he's hit it too close to cover, who takes it well, low, in both hands, diving forward. Taylor did well to bowl it full again, but not as wide as the previous ball, and Finch pushed hard at it, way out in front of his body Wardlaw to Clarke, SIX runs full outside off, and Clarke has a merry swing at it, with a whippy finish to launch it over the long-on boundary Wardlaw to Clarke, OUT taken! That's brilliant from Leask at the deep square leg boundary. It was short again, angling into the body, and Clarke pulled it in the air, to the fielder's right. Sprints quickly across, and throws himself across to come up with the ball in his right hand 8.00pm That's all from us for this game. Do tune in for tomorrow's matches and the rest of the World Cup too, and keep sending in your comments. Until next time, good night! Australia won by 7 wickets (with 208 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Starc, AUS","Australia 133 for 3 (Clarke 47) beat Scotland 130 (Machan 40, Starc 4-14, Cummins 3-42) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The camera panned to the Australian dressing room. The sky was gloomy, the rain was getting heavier and the covers were on for two hours in Hobart. Steven Smith and Shane Watson looked nervous. More than they had been for the two and a half hours and 25.4 overs that Scotland batted."
"2.03 pm: We have news from the middle as Australia have won the toss, and they have elected to bat. Strap in your seatbelts, folks, we could be in for a sizable first-innings haul. Malinga to Warner, OUT what a set-up from Malinga! this time takes off the pace of this length delivery on middle and off, deceiving Warner as he offers a half-hearted push which finds it way to extra-cover, who is able to take it comfortably. Huge blow for Australia as Warner has to go Malinga to Smith, 1 wide shuffles over to the off side as this attempted yorker on leg misses its mark, with the umpire calling a wide. Smith had shuffled over too much, so is lucky that Malinga did not find the target Prasanna to Finch, OUT Prasanna you beauty! Removes the ever-dangerous Finch with a slider down the leg side which Finch attacked early as he played down the wrong line. Sangakkara does the rest as he picks this up and flicks the bails in one fluid motion as Finch looks back disconcertingly. Huge roar from the Sri Lankans as Finch makes his way back to the pavilion Dilshan to Smith, OUT and now it is Steven Smith's time to go as he looks for a tonk straight down the ground, with this one swirling high in the air before Thisara, somewhere between long off and extra-cover, is able to get under it and take it before falling away. Met with great excitement by the SL fans as Smith storms away after a brilliantly played 72 Prasanna to Maxwell, SIX runs Maxwell shows just why he is the package as he fetches this one on off before slamming it over deep backward square with a flick. Incredible shot as there really wasn't anything different Prasanna could have done there Perera to Maxwell, SIX runs provides him some pace now, which Maxwell laps up as he heaves over deep midwicket to just get this over the rope. Brings up yet another World Cup fifty, this one coming off just 26 balls. Perera to Maxwell, OUT and the curtains are drawn on yet another Maxwell blinder as he fails to get away this full-toss delivey from Perera, with this going straight up over mid-on, with Malinga doing well to complete the catch, with a tumble to finish. Maxwell hasn't yet departed as they are looking at the front foot no ball. No issues there as he was miles behind the crease. Looks like this was also a legitimate delivery as it Perera to Faulkner, OUT in the slot again as Faulkner is obligated to get to the other end after he hears Watson's call. Drilled this to the fielder at cover, who is able to pick it up and throw it to Perera at the non-striker's, who is able to flick off the bails before Faulkner grounded his bat. Bonus wicket for Sri Lanka as Faulkner goes for a golden duck Perera to Maxwell, SIX runs just waits on this slower delivery outside off before dispatching it with a pull over midwicket for six. Unbelievable ball-striking from Maxwell! Perera to Maxwell, 1 wide searching for the wide yorker as he strays too far down the margin Perera to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin reminds Sri Lanka of his presence with this powerful strike over extra-cover which just sails over the boundary. Perera dished up a length delivery which Haddin took care of in his own inimitable way Perera to Watson, OUT Watson now looking for the long blast over long off, but Chandimal who is able to settle under this top-edge, is able to complete a catch finally in the deep. Ends a fantastic knock from Watson who has done his World Cup campaign a whole lot of good with this effort Angelo Mathews to Haddin, OUT slower length delivery now which Haddin looks to send orbiting over Sydney, but ends up slicing away over to cover, who is able to get under it safely. Has to go as Australia look to rack up as many as possible off these final deliveries Glenn Maxwell: It is nice to finally get the monkey off the back. Scored a few 90s recently, so it is nice to finally pull through. It is a big relief to get it out of the way, and hopefully it is the first of many. The top order set us up beautifully to have a little bit of fun at the end. Just need to maintain a good line and length and backup our bowling with some good fielding. Faulkner to Dilshan, OUT Faulkner raps Dilshan right on middle and off as he plays all around this one. Goes up straightaway for the appeal, which the umpire corroborates soon after. Dilshan wants the review though after consulting with Sangakkara at the other end. It was another back-of-the-hand slower ball which definitely hit in line as there are four reds across the screen. Dilshan has to go, much to the delight of the Sydne Starc to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Mahela takes on the arm of Clarke at mid-off after driving this fuller one from Starc, and has to pay the price as he nails down the stumps at the non-striker's as he looked to usher in Sangakkara to the strike. Was well out of his ground, despite putting in the dive, as he heads back to the pavilion. That could be a major blow to SL's chances as this chase gets into the business end of the innin Faulkner to Sangakkara, 1 leg bye pick ups a single down fine leg as Mathews gets onto the hot seat Faulkner to Sangakkara, OUT and that may very well be game for Sri Lanka as Kumar finally departs from the middle after looking to go after this Faulkner delivery, which was slipped in at a fuller length, as he ends up slicing over to the man at deep cover, who this time is able to get under it comfortably. There was some hesitation on the part of the fourth umpire to give this as replays show Faulkner just about, and I mean jus Doherty to Angelo Mathews, SIX runs fetches this one tossed up on middle and off as he looks for the big slog-sweep over midwicket, but ends up getting a top-edge which just carries over Warner, who went for a hop at backward square, before realising this one was sailing over comfortably Johnson to Prasanna, 1 wide short and slipping down leg as the umpire swivels round to signal the scorers Just hang on to your horses, folks as we wait on some quotes from the match presentation. Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 376 for 9 (Maxwell 102, Smith 72, Clarke 68, Watson 67) beat Sri Lanka 312 (Sangakkara 104, Dilshan 62, Chandimal 52 retired hurt, Faulkner 3-48) by 64 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A young punk scored a punkish first century - the fastest by an Australian and one ball slower than the fastest by anybody at a World Cup, a master scored a classic third consecutive hundred - the first man to do so at a World Cup, there were five supporting half-centuries, but eventually the Sydney runathon was decided by Australia's superior bowling and fielding under pressure. Glenn Maxwell finally got that hundred he has been promising to take Australia to 376, but Kumar Sangakkara's masterclass kept Sri Lanka in the game until Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews were eliminated - Chandimal injured and Mathews out to a slower bouncer from Shane Watson - in the 42nd over with 94 runs still required. Matches between Test sides have been pretty formulaic this World Cup: bat first, score 300, win easy. Pakistan have bucked the trend by winning with 230 on the board, and Sri Lanka have shown 300 can be chased. With Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan in form, a 130-run stand in just under 20 overs told Australia this was not going to be an easy win."
"Mohammad Nabi has won the toss and Afghanistan will bowl. He says there is moisture in the pitch, which they want to use. Usman Ghani is back in the XI ahead of Gulbadin Naib. Australia have made two changes as expected: Hazelwood in for Cummins and Faulkner in for Watson Shapoor to Warner, 1 leg bye short of a length, into the body, kisses the thigh pad on the way through, and Afsar makes a good save down the leg side Shapoor to Warner, 1 wide gets the length right by bowling full, but concedes a wide down leg Hamid to Smith, 1 wide full outswinger but starts a touch too wide, and is called too Hamid to Smith, 1 leg bye moves across again, misses one on off, but the bounce is carrying it over when it hits the pad Shapoor to Warner, 1 leg bye another lovely yorker. Beats the inside edge. Concedes a leg-bye Hamid to Faulkner, OUT that's a lovely yorker. Hassan brings out the mini chainsaw. Inswinging yorker. On the middle and leg. Dips on him too. Beats the inside edge. Possibly takes the toe on the way to the stumps Zadran to Maxwell, OUT there won't be a fastest WC hundred here. Maxwell yet to score an ODI hundred. Slower ball, half-volley, draws a sort of a mis-hit, and he ends up offering a catch to extra cover. Another excellent innings by Maxwell at the WACA, but still not a hundred for him M Nabi to Warner, 1 wide fires in a wide down the leg side. That's the fear of Warner Mangal to Marsh, OUT short ball, down the wicket, doesn't quite time this, and he finds deep midwicket with this hit Hazlewood to Ghani, 1 wide fuller but the line is still wrong. Another wide Johnson to Ghani, 1 wide wide down the leg side as Johnson looks for a bouncer Johnson to Asghar, 1 wide pushes this across him, wide Marsh to Mangal, SIX runs length ball, middle and leg, he likes this gentler pace, he clears the front leg and lofts this over midwicket for a six Johnson to Zadran, 1 wide full, slower ball, wide down the leg side Johnson to Zadran, 1 wide bouncer now, called a wide for height as he sways out of its line Faulkner to Afsar Zazai, 1 wide wide outside off as he goes for the slower ball Maxwell to Zadran, SIX runs some of Maxwell medicine back to him. Down the wicket, almost halfway down the pitch, and swings hard at this. Big big six over long-on. In the second tier Hazlewood to Afsar Zazai, OUT they don't have a review left, and he has to walk back even if he has not edged it. This is short of a length, outside off, nips back in, goes between the bat and him. Haddin takes the catch. Australia are pretty confident they have got the edge, but Zazai is not walking until the umpire raises the finger. Snicko registers That's all from here folks. Switch off the lights when you leave. Cheers Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 417 for 6 (Warner 178, Smith 95, Maxwell 88) beat Afghanistan 142 (Mangal 33, Johnson 4-22) by 275 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details David Warner had passed hundred in the 25th over. He breezed past 150 in the 30th. It appeared like he was on cruise control. He might have looked his usual belligerent self when compared to Steven Smith's 98-ball 95, but looked downright tame when Glenn Maxwell came out with reverse sweeps, scoops, flicks blazing. Afghanistan were left to run down the highest total in World Cup history - 417 for 6."
"6.40pm Australia won the toss and will bowl Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 leg bye good length and sliding onto the pads. Looks to whip that over short fine, cops it on the thigh Starc to S Dhawan, OUT knocks out off stump with a trademark delivery! He's back. Starc is back. High 140s, outswinger starting middle and curving viciously towards off. Dhawan's got his front leg in the leg side and his stumps exposed as he creates room for the drive through cover. The late swing and the pace does him and it's a pretty sight as the st Starc to Kohli, 1 wide full and very wide outside off. Searching for that swing, but this is past the tramline. Kohli lets it go Abbott to Rahul, SIX runs slaughtered! Whew. He has picked the length so quickly on this. It's short of a length. He's got a front foot press but quickly springs back up as the ball rises and then nails the pull on the up. Sweet, sweet sound Swepson to Kohli, OUT balloons back to the bowler. The only thing going for Swepson this ball is that it has gripped. It's short but it's gripped and turned away and gotten big on Kohli in the corridor. He's shaping to pull but checks himself and it pops back gently to the bowler off the leading edge Abbott to Samson, 1 wide slips this full down the leg side Henriques to Samson, OUT straight to cover! Full outside off, was in the slot for the drive, but Samson couldn't have picked out the fielder on the edge of the ring with any more precision Zampa to Pandey, OUT good catch at short third man! Hazlewood does well to get down to that. Pandey went back to a slightly shorter ball, goes for the cut, it takes the top edge and is dipping as it reaches Hazlewood Henriques to Hardik, 1 leg bye short of a length, gets himself into a tangle here as he looks to pull, hammers into Pandya's hip and loops away. That will be painful Henriques to Hardik, SIX runs into the stands! Pandya had changed his bat before that ball and this one is working nicely. Full outside off, he's able to get underneath and swings high and mighty over long-on Henriques to Hardik, OUT high...very high, and taken at long-off! Pandya is cut off before he can really get going, gets all height on this one, low down on the bat, Smith has plenty of time to get underneath it Starc to Sundar, OUT straight to long-on...couldn't get the distance on it and a comfortable catch WATCH: Hardik Pandya holes out to Steven Smith at long-off (India subcontinent only) 9:12pm Alright, we're ready for the chase. It's Finch and Short coming out to open. Wade is slated to bat No. 3. Chahar with the ball. Player of the match is Yuzvendra Chahal, INDIA","India 161 for 7 (Rahul 51, Jadeja 44*, Henriques 3-22, Starc 2-34) beat Australia 150 for 7 (Finch 35, Short 34, Chahal 3-25, Natarajan 3-30) by 11 runs Concussion substitute Yuzvendra Chahal plucked three vital wickets and opened a fresh chapter in cricket's long history of debating topics after being chosen - controversially - to replace Ravindra Jadeja, delivering India a comfortable victory in the opening T20I at Manuka Oval in Canberra. ALSO WATCH: Match highlights - Jadeja, Chahal, Natarajan help India win series opener (India subcontinent only) Jadeja's exit from the contest - he suffered a hamstring injury first and was then hit on the helmet in the last over of India's innings - allowed India to call upon a wristspinner in Chahal, who had been harshly treated during the ODI series but found himself defending a serviceable total on the night and responding grandly. Yuzvendra Chahal made a big impact after coming on as a concussion substitute Getty Images In contrast, the Australians gradually lost grip of a contest that had appeared more or less in their keeping when India were restricted to 114 for 6 with 19 balls of their innings remaining after Aaron Finch sent them in to bat. A target of 162 should still have been well within the grasp of Finch's team, but their innings sank steadily into the mire thanks to Chahal, T Natarajan's zippy left-armers, and Virat Kohli's growing command of the battlefield. Starc returns in finer fettle Something was not quite right about Mitchell Starc in the first two ODIs, and he was missing from the third with what was described as a minor side and/or rib complaint."
"Starc to Nijjar, 1 leg bye Innings Start","Australians 562 (Marsh 169, Nevill 78, Warner 94, Watson 52) and 221 (Clarke 77, Porter 3-42) beat Essex 414 (Westley 144, Bopara 107, Starc 6-51) and 200 (ten Doeschate 61, Hazlewood 4-42, Starc 3-26) by 169 runs Scorecard 1:51 Australia quicks lift after news of Harris retirement As confirmation of Ryan Harris' retirement filtered around Chelmsford, Jesse Ryder was collaring Josh Hazlewood for 26 runs from the young paceman's first over. The Australians looked understandably flat, having taken in an emotional address from Harris barely an hour before. Professional sport, though, is about pushing through all distractions and preparing for what lies ahead. The fact that Harris will not be going there with them made it imperative for others to step forward, and Hazlewood duly regathered himself after Ryder's early blows to help round up Essex and complete a second comfortable Australian victory in as many tour matches. Mitchell Starc was also effective, and if there was a slightly apologetic air about the way the Australians celebrated their wickets, it was at least partly because they arrived with increasing regularity in the afternoon."
"Starc to Roy, 1 wide now that's flung very wide outside off, almost misses the cut strip Cummins to Hales, OUT well, that's done it! 91mph, Hales done for pace. Another low full toss, Hales is late on the stroke, gets an inside edge onto the pads then into the stumps Cummins to Roy, OUT and another! Two in the over for Cummins. Roy tries to launch a length delivery over the off side, but gets more elevation that distance...still, took a very good catch by Coulter-Nile as he back-tracked from mid-off Boyce to Ali, SIX runs he targets the short boundary, basically just slugs a length delivery straight down the ground Watson to Morgan, 1 wide the pressure tells, fired miles outside off stump Cummins to Morgan, SIX runs these straight boundaries are very short...Morgan manages to larrup a big full toss off somewhere near the bottom of the bat and it lands in the crowd Coulter-Nile to Morgan, OUT gets underneath this, goes miles into the Cardiff sky and does not quite have the distance this time as Watson settles under it just inside the rope at long on Starc to Buttler, 1 wide a wide full toss outside off Starc to Buttler, OUT finds mid-on...clubs a length delivery and doesn't get elevation or placement. A brief, lively stay for Buttler. Next! Cummins to Billings, 1 leg bye done for pace again, nudging 94mph, rattles into the top of his leg as he tries to pull and the leg bye means it keeps the strike which Australia won't mind Starc to Billings, OUT a straight, low full toss is driven straight to mid-off...Smith's throw is on target, Starc takes the bails off. Billings struggled today Willey to Warner, OUT gone! Taken at third man! Curious dismissal, but not entirely dissimilar to a couple of the Test dismissals when he was out pulling. Was a shorter delivery, Warner wanted to play into the leg side and got into a bit of a tangle, the ball took the thick leading ed Finn to Watson, OUT dragged on! Oh Watto! Would you believe it. A good length ball from Finn which he defended down by his feet. It them bobbles back towards the stumps, Watson tries to kick it away but misses and can only watch as the ball dislodged a bail Stokes to Smith, 1 leg bye aims to flick a back-of-a-length delivery and it takes the thigh pad behind square Willey to Smith, OUT he's gone! Ten short of a hundred. Smith got too far underneath this as he aimed to clear deep midwicket. The ball went high, came off the bottom of the bat and his hand came off the handle...Billings takes the vital catch Player of the match is Moeen Ali, ENG","England 182 for 5 (Morgan 74, Moeen 72) beat Australia 177 for 8 (Smith 90) by five runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details In years to come, people will look at the scorecard of this match and presume that Ben Stokes - with modest bowling figures and a peripheral figure with the bat - played nothing more than a supporting role in this game. But Stokes, with an outstanding catch and a nerveless final over, played a key part in an England victory that continues a remarkable summer that promised little more than pain and has delivered more promise and encouragement than even the most optimistic supporters could have anticipated. After a grim 2014 when they lost nine of their 12 T20Is, including a wretched World T20 campaign, new-look England have now won three in a row and have defeated the No. 2 ranked side. Their limited-overs resurgence, a development that looked most unlikely when they were knocked out of the World Cup at the first hurdle only a few months ago, continues."
"12:05pm: The sun is out and Australia win the toss and choose to bat. Dockrell, Sorensen and Kevin O'Brien, who is nursing a hamstring injury, are out. Agar, Stoinis and Pattinson miss out for Australia. Murtagh to Bailey, OUT the pressure tells. The lines and lengths work to perfection. Pitches on a good length and comes back in just a tad. Any guesses where it was directed? The ball takes the top of off and Aus are now three down. Bailey wanted to work it behind square on the off side but a little bit of nip accounted for him. Murtagh to Maxwell, 1 leg bye very full and quick on Maxwell's pads who is struck high down leg, they get a leg bye though McBrine to Maxwell, OUT and another one goes. Maxwell is gone. Ireland coming back into it now. Flat and quick outside off, a nothing delivery actually. Maxwell lazily stays in his crease, looking to punch through the off side but he gets a thick outside edge, which is extremely well taken by Niall. Big deflection. Thompson to Smith, OUT edged and taken. Ireland get the big wicket of Steven Smith. Great, reflex catch by Niall. Shortish length outside off, Smith looks to guide down to third man or punch it wide of point but gets a thick outside edge which flies towards Niall who dives very nicely low to his right to hang on to a stunner. McBrine to Warner, SIX runs what a shot. picks the delivery to go after and the execution is exemplary. Flighted on middle, Warner comes down the track and meets the ball as it pitched, deposits it over long-on Young to Burns, OUT gone this time. Shortish length on middle, Burns picks the length early and wants to pull over square leg but gets a thick top edge which flies in the air with no distance. Niall gets under it and takes a comfortable catch. The umpires take a look at the front line again but this time he is behind the line. Young to Warner, SIX runs shot of the day for me. Just a tad short, and Warner is very quick on the length much like Burns but the difference was the execution. Perfectly executed and timed, goes well over square leg for a massive six. Mooney to Marsh, OUT straight up in the air and taken. marsh goes now. Mooney cleverly delivers it from wider of the crease with a bit of leg cut, Marsh looks to hit over long-off again but the change in point of delivery helps taking the outer half of the bat. Murtagh settles under it and takes a good catch. 4.58pm The sun is out now, so only a matter of how much water has fallen on the outfield and the deterioration of the pitch. If it is a 40-over match, target for Ireland will be 248. In the event it is reduced to the minimum 20 overs, target will be 158. So those are the extremes, the target and the amount of overs should be somewhere in between. Starc to Porterfield, 1 wide strays in line this time. Starc is looking for some swing but there is absolutely none. Goes down leg and wide called Starc to Porterfield, OUT one good ball is all you need though. Starc gets one absolutely right. Very full on middle and leg, one of Starc's trademark yorkers. Sneaks past Porterfield's bat, takes a bit of his pad and takes the stumps more importantly. Unplayable delivery, came back in late to WP who had no chance against a delivery as good as that Coulter-Nile to N O'Brien, 1 wide ooh, quick bouncer. Well directed at NOB's badge. He ducks under it very late and very awkwardly, called wide though Coulter-Nile to Joyce, 1 wide strays down leg this time for an extra Maxwell to Thompson, SIX runs another six. Flight on leg, Thompson comes forward and lofts the ball with lost of elegance wide of long-on for the second six of the over. Excellent shot Cummins to Thompson, 1 bye very fast offcutter there, may have been the slower bouncer. Thompson sways out of the line and the ball moves a a lot after passing the batsman, Wade does well to stop it from beating him 7.45pm So, Ireland fought hard but Australia were a bit too strong for them today. They were in the game for large parts of that chase but was a hard task with the depth in Australia's bowling line up. Joyce and O'Brien played really well in the middle but the rest of the batsmen struggled to do much.

"10.10am Members of the England Disability team, which has recently won the inaugural ICRC International T20 tournament in Bangladesh, are parading the trophy around the boundary. Fantastic achievement by them. Hastings to Hales, OUT so nearly dropped at point, but grabbed at the second attempt! A horrid scratchy innings comes to an end. That was his first real shot in anger, and it scooted straight at Maxwell's head, who eventually clung onto the second attempt down by his knees Hastings to Taylor, OUT lovely delivery! Climbed off the deck and Hastings has his reward for perseverance. Taylor's eagerness to put bat on ball is his undoing as he feathers an edge through to Wade, and now England are in serious bother Cummins to Stokes, 1 wide banged in short, too short, ironic cheers Marsh to Bairstow, OUT massive appeal! Very full, very straight, but given not out ... it's a review.... no bat involved, now then, is it hitting leg full enough, indeed it is! That's out! Marsh to Ali, OUT a gloriously Gower-esque departure from Moeen Ali, as if to prove the earlier point! He played the shot on merit, but the upshot is an edge to the keeper and a rather desperate scoreline Marsh to Willey, OUT hit on the pads, huge appeal from Marsh... and Bailey's finger goes up! Is that another one gone? Willey asks for the review, this is going to depend on whether the ball pitched in line... and Hawk-Eye says it did, bang on and straightening, would have shuddered the top of Marsh to Stokes, SIX runs brutal, Stokes continues his Neo impression with a rousing thwack down the ground for six! Skipped out to a full ball and smoked it back into the sight screen... The crowd, and all right-thinking people, liked that Marsh to Stokes, OUT struck on the pads, up goes the finger - Stokes is a goner, too! Very similar to the Willey dismissal, hit on the knee roll around the line of leg stump, umpire Bailey doesn't take long to make his decision and England have no more reviews. It looked a good appeal at first Cummins to Rashid, 1 wide banged in short, Rashid ducks... and the crowd lairily greets the call of wide Agar to Topley, OUT pinned in front and that's all over, red rover! The simplest lbw decision of the day, Topley playing back to one that gripped a little and straightened on off stump, plumb as a pudding 1.10pm: It's been easy like Sunday morning for Australia and, since they've wrapped England up so quickly, they'll have a bat before luncheon is served. Ben Stokes and Adil Rashid played valiant hands but England couldn't recover from the loss of three early wickets and, more troublingly, Eoin Morgan Topley to Finch, 1 leg bye a rowdy appeal but that was nipping back too much Willey to Smith, 1 wide outside off, tempting the loose drive, but too much width that time Wood to Bailey, 1 leg bye big oooh from the crowd as Wood nips one into the pads but that was going way over the stumps, as it deflects down to third man Wood to Finch, FOUR runs oh, fetch that, too full and too straight and whipped away through midwicket for four more - that's the 50 stand, almost all of them in the six overs since the interval Topley to Finch, 1 wide this one is, however, a bumper veering to leg as Finch tries to pull Topley to Bailey, 4 leg byes angled in from round the wicket, just a scratch of bat on it from Bailey sends the ball fine to the boundary Topley to Bailey, 1 leg bye short, at the body, hits the thigh pad and dribbles into the leg side *You are the engine which drives ball-by-ball commentary and for that we salute you. Well, you and the actual balls, of course Australia won by 8 wickets (with 154 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 140 for 2 (Finch 70*) beat England 138 (Stokes 42, Marsh 4-27, Hastings 3-21) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details It wasn't a dead rubber, but neither was it a particularly competitive finish to the series. Led by a strong performance from their fast bowlers, who rolled England for 138, Australia cruised to an eight-wicket victory in the final ODI Old Trafford and ended their three-month tour of England, which featured the disappointment of another failed Ashes campaign, with a 3-2 win in the one-day series. Mitchell Marsh and John Hastings might hardly be the most intimidating pair of fast bowlers but it was they who caused England's collapse, between them collecting seven of the nine wickets that fell. Aaron Finch and George Bailey then steered Australia past their target with ease. In the end, the fans barely saw half the amount of overs they expected - 57."
"Agar to Gill, OUT Given lbw! Gill takes his time but he finally reviews. Gill tried to sweep a delivery that pitched on off and slid on, it hit the front pad a fair way down and the umpire gave it out. Nothing on hot spot or RTS in terms of bat involved Zampa to Iyer, OUT gone! Iyer was looking to force the pace there, trying to reverse some of the momentum Australia have built with these quiet overs. Full and quickish, on the stumps, and Iyer looks to make room to drive through - or maybe over - the c Agar to Rahul, OUT gone, that's not a good shot at all. It's quite full, it's on the stumps, and it's hugely risky to try and sweep those balls. This one passes under his bat, and he's been given out lbw. He's reviewed... Only bounce can save him, I thi Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT ooh, Australia have reviewed for a caught-behind! Back of a length, straightening just a touch in the corridor. Kohli is looking initially to work this with the angle, I think, and then he's adjusting to the movement when the bal Abbott to Hardik, SIX runs upper cut over point! Sensational shot. Short outside off, he backed away, gave himself room and slapped it up and over point into the dug out Hazlewood to Jadeja, SIX runs launched over midwicket onto the hill! Great strike. Hazlewood missed his length, it was in the slot and Jadeja smashed it high over midwicket. It was the third-best 6th wicket partnership for India in ODI cricket . Thakur to Smith, OUT got him! No 62-ball hundred today for Smith. Not the most aesthetically pleasing dismissal, but Thakur won't care. Back of a length, angling down leg, and Smith, who's shuffled a long way across as he always does, looks to glance it Jadeja to Finch, SIX runs a slog sweep over backward square! What a shot to bring up another half-century!. Outside off and he hammers this over the man on the rope! Thakur to Henriques, OUT caught at midwicket! A pull shot picks out Dhawan! Back of a length, cross seam, similar to one in the previous over that he nailed, but this one he hit knee high to Dhawan. Big wicket Jadeja to Finch, OUT holes out to long on! The dot balls on Green has built the pressure on Finch and he holes out> He's tried to launch this down the ground, he miscued to Dhawan at long on and he nearly spilled it but was able to hold on rolling to th Kuldeep to Green, OUT caught at deep backward square! Superb catch by Jadeja! Full outside leg, he sweeps in the air, flat behind square, it curved in the air, Jadeja ran in from well behind square and took an excellent catch diving forward. Green depar Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide short, angling down leg. Looks to pull and misses. Wanted to bowl the bouncer at his front shoulder, I guess, and missed his line marginally Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs bang. The open stance allows him easier access to this sort of line. Length ball, angling into middle stump or so, and he gets forward, head over the ball, and absolutely shovels it over the midwicket boundary with super quic Thakur to Carey, 1 leg bye length ball, looks to work it into the leg side and misses. Aborted lbw appeal because it pitched outside leg Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide big wide down the leg side. Wanted to angle it into his feet and deny him room Natarajan to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to go wide and outside Maxwell's hitting arc, slanting it away from him from over the wicket. It's hard to control the line while doing that, and Maxwell shoulders arms as the ball crosses the tramline Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to follow up with the leg-stump yorker, and he misses his mark by inches. Maxwell looked to step across and help it fine, and couldn't put bat to it Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT bam, the bails go flying all over the place. That elastic right arm goes beyond the vertical and whangs it full and fast, at the base of the stumps. Maxwell looks to make room and carve it through the covers, working against the a Thakur to Abbott, OUT slower bouncer, and Thakur has the breakthrough. Third wicket for him. Gets up just around shoulder height, angling in and cramping Abbott for room, and he plays a half-hearted pull, only managing to lob it to the keeper off his gl Natarajan to Agar, OUT and he gets the last recognised batsman! Boundaries were needed, and this ball - more or less in the slot, off-stumpish - had to be attacked. Made room to go over cover, but he simply couldn't find the elevation, and the fielder p Bumrah to Zampa, OUT big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. B 10.28pm A dead rubber, but they're often really entertaining. Today's game had so much packed into it, and in the end, the most significant bit of the action was an outstanding sixth-wicket partnership between Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, which hauled In 10.46pm Right then, that's all from us from this ODI series. We hope you've enjoyed it as much as we did. The T20Is will begin soon, and there's a whole lot of other cricket going on around the world right now too (I wonder if this would have seemed possible s Player of the match is Hardik Pandya, INDIA","India 5 for 302 (Pandya 92*, Jadeja 66*, Kohli 63, Agar 2-44) beat Australia 289 (Finch 75, Maxwell 59, Thakur 3-51, Bumrah 2-43) by 13 runs India were five down in 32 overs, staring at a below-par total, and with that a series clean sweep, when Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja came together to nearly double their then score of 152, which turned out to be just enough thanks to a gun spell from Jasprit Bumrah in the end. Pandya ended up with a career-best unbeaten 92 off 76, and Jadeja doubled up his 50-ball 66 with the wicket of a set Aaron Finch and a smart low catch in the field. Australia's chase went similar to India's innings - the fourth wickets fell at the exact same point, 123 in 25.3 overs - but the hosts kept losing wickets to fall short by 13 runs. The pitch wasn't as flat as was expected when India won the toss, and it showed in how they managed to successfully defend what was only the third-highest total in a full-length ODI at this heavy-scoring ground."
"Willey to Burns, OUT angled across, Burns prods at it... and plays on to his stumps! An unconvincing stay from Burns, didn't really get a feel for ball on bat and this time a fraction of inward movement results in a drag-on. The ball was not quite there to cut, no real conviction in the shot Willey to Smith, 1 wide slides down the leg side Willey to Smith, OUT pinned in front, Smith falling over his feet - gone! A corking delivery, right up in the blockhole and Smith failed to get bat on it this time as he swung across the line, hit on the back foot plumb in front of middle and off, the ball curving back beautifully... Thinks abou Willey to Finch, OUT goes on with the arm, Finch feels for it and nicks off! Willey fell over in his follow through and had to appeal from the floor - but it's Australia who looking unsteady on their feet, three down for spit. Willey has been mixing up inswingers with bother-balls in the channel Ali to Maxwell, OUT speared in and leg stump is pegged back, Maxwell bowled trying to reverse-sweep! The onslaught is over, a reversey Percy too many, though it's a surprise that Maxwell got it wrong rather than Bailey... The ball was straight and skipped under the bat as Maxwell aimed another Ali to Bailey, 1 leg bye flat on the stumps, Bailey comes forward and plays across the line, deflects off his pad to a gap at midwicket Plunkett to Marsh, OUT full, straight, chipped high and hard but only as far as David Willey at long-off who took a well-judged catch in the deep. Instant strike for England and that target of 300 takes a touch of a dent Plunkett to Bailey, OUT gosh, now that changes things! Bailey was early onto the drive, the ball stopped in the pitch, popped up off the bat sticker, and straight back into the bowler's grateful mitts! England, it is fair to say, are bossing this Powerplay. Ali to Stoinis, OUT reverse sweep, and Australia have lost their third wicket in ten balls! Stoinis drops to one knee, attempts to pick the gap, but merely picks out gully instead! A disappointing debut ends. With the bat at least ... Plunkett to Hastings, 1 wide too wide this time and called as such Wood to Wade, SIX runs blatted over midwicket as Wade picked Wood's slower ball. So much for Hastings being off-strike, this will do nicely for Australia Pattinson to Taylor, 1 leg bye on the pads, very full, and England accept the extra as square leg tidies up Cummins to Stokes, 1 wide bit of a rubbish ball really. Down the leg side and through to the keeper on the third bounce Maxwell to Morgan, SIX runs now Morgan goes after him and sends this into orbit...! That will come down with snow on it somewhere deep in the western terrace Pattinson to Stokes, 1 wide slides down the leg side as Stokes tries to glance unsuccessfully Marsh to Stokes, OUT bowled him, slips a yorker under the bat, Stokes is gone! May have taken the pace off a touch and Stokes was beaten aiming a push down the ground, he looks back in disgust... A decent, controlled knock, and a useful stand but that's opened up a chink for Australia to try an Marsh to Morgan, 1 wide length ball but it drifts behind Morgan down the leg side Cummins to Morgan, OUT pitched up and sliced to backward point WHERE MAXWELL GRABS A SCREAMER! Australia are still in this, Morgan falls short of a hundred thanks to a brilliant one-handed take from Maxwell low to his right, more than making up for his fumble a couple of balls ago. Cummins has Maxwell to Plunkett, 1 leg bye worked into the leg-side, off the pad, a good over for England regardless of the wicket Pattinson to Ali, 1 leg bye full and straight, big appeal and a review but that pitched outside leg. It would have splattered all three stumps, but them's the rules Cummins to Plunkett, OUT wow, was that actually a clean catch? It's becoming commonplace these days, to take the ball above the head, on the rope, stagger back, lob the ball back into play, leap back over the rope, snaffle the rebound in mid-air and land as if nothing has happened. But Glenn Ma Hastings to Willey, SIX runs woomph! A massive slap for six straight down the ground! David Willey finishes the match as he started it, with a flourish! ""it did a little bit this morning, similar to Lord's, we've just got to be a little more watchful and make sure we have wickets in the shed for the late onslaught."" So, Australia paid the price for resting the tiring Mitchell Starc. Pat Cummins' at-times-fearsome pace earned him four wickets but the support cast was lacking today. Eoin Morgan, as fresh as a daisy after his recent break with Middlesex, top-scored for England with 92 and everyone after Alex Hales a So, from 0-2 to 2-2 in the time it takes to cross the Pennines. England and Australia reconvene at Old Trafford on Sunday for a very tasty decider. England won by 3 wickets (with 10 balls remaining) Player of the match is Eoin Morgan, ENG","England 304 for 7 (Morgan 92, Cummins 4-49) beat Australia 299 for 7 (Maxwell 85, Bailey 75, Wade 50*, Willey 3-51) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Eoin Morgan led England to a three-wicket victory in the fourth ODI at Headingley, where they levelled the series 2-2 and ensured the final match at Old Trafford on Sunday will be the decider. It was, in the end, a near perfectly judged run chase. England needed 300, exactly a run a ball in 50 overs, and Morgan showed his team-mates how to pace the pursuit, with 92 off 92 balls himself. They got there with ten balls to spare, but not without some high drama along the way, including a pair of spectacular catches from Glenn Maxwell that threatened to bring Australia back into the contest. But England's nerve held, and fittingly David Willey clubbed the winning six down the ground off John Hastings to complete a fine day that began with him claiming three wickets in the first ten overs of the morning."
"Agar to Roy, OUT comes forward, chipped into the off side without conviction - and Roy is gone! This is a waste, he was looking so good and he has donated Agar his maiden ODI wicket, popping the ball straight to short extra cover. Maxwell initially palmed it up into the air and then grabbed it at the second attempt Cummins to Taylor, 1 wide slightly back of a length and veering down the leg side Agar to Morgan, 1 wide slips this one down the leg side Maxwell to Morgan, 1 wide speared down the leg side, Morgan misses his sweep Maxwell to Morgan, OUT picks out long-off...Maxwell strikes first ball back! Aims to clear the boundary again, but it comes off the bottom of the bat and lands comfortably in the lap of Starc as he takes a couple of paces in Marsh to Stokes, 1 wide sprays it wide as Stokes jumps out... Too wide Maxwell to Stokes, OUT slogged high into the leg side and Finch positions himself safely under it at mid-on! Stokes will obstruct the England innings no longer, he was trying to put Maxwell into the confectionary stall but only succeeded in sending a top edge billowing straight up into sky Cummins to Ali, OUT Moeen goes big... and goes home! Tries to pull a length ball from outside off stump and sends a top edge steepling to midwicket. England are trying to tap out, here Starc to Taylor, OUT short of a length, tries to club down the ground... but can't clear mid-off! Taylor falls for 101, top-edging tamely to the edge of the ring to leave England eight down 5.30pm: England have posted 300 but it was with something of a whimper, after they were 205 for 2 with 17 overs to go. We'll have to wait a couple of hours before we can properly evaluate James Taylor's hundred, I think - he certainly held England together, as wickets fell in the latter overs, but there will be plenty who think this is a below-par score. What is certain is Woakes to Finch, 1 leg bye gets inside the line of this delivery and flicks it backward of square...ah, there's no bat. Just off the thigh pad Woakes to Finch, 1 wide a short ball outside off, Finch bails out of his pull and it's called wide on height Rashid to Smith, OUT what a catch! Finn at short midwicket. Unusual position for him, but he's used his reach to great effect. Smith down the pitch, aimed a flick through the leg side, Finn flings himself to his right - almost horizontal - sticks out his right hand and holds a blinder. Jonty Rhodes and Ben Stokes would have been proud. Ali to Maxwell, OUT tries a reverse dab this time, a top edge loops up and Bairstow takes a simple catch! Umpire Wilson slowly raises his finger and although Maxwell looks disgusted it is probably with the shot rather than the decision. It was more of a poke where the previous two attempts went fully through with the shot and the ball spooned off the toe, hit the ar Plunkett to Agar, OUT amazing! Roy holds what turns into a screamer. Agar launched this miles into the night sky and into the lights. Roy steadies himself at long on, but slightly misjudges it and the ball spills out as he falls backwards but, astonishingly, he is able to hold the rebound before the ball falls to the ground. A touch of fortune, yes, but some mind-bo Player of the match is James Taylor, ENG","England 300 for 8 (Taylor 101, Roy 63, Morgan 62) beat Australia 207 (Finch 53, Moeen 3-32) by 93 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details England clawed their way back into the ODI series against Australia with a 93-run victory at Old Trafford. A maiden international century from Man of the Match James Taylor provided the bedrock of England's total of 300, before their spinners went to work on a dry surface, claiming 5 for 73 between them in 20 overs. Moeen Ali finished with career-best ODI figures while Adil Rashid has never bowled better in an England shirt. It was England's first win in eight ODIs against Australia and only their second in 13. It means the sides go to Headingley with the series poised at 2-1 with two to play."
"11am: England win the toss and choose to bowl against unchanged Australia. Finn to Burns, 1 wide Finn loses his radar. He slings a bouncer down leg. Burns half-ducks under it Finn to Burns, 1 wide sliding down the leg side, umpire Tim Robinson calls it a wide Finn to Burns, OUT The middle stump is tiled back. Finn shoots through Burns' gate. He has been pretty good with the drive but fails this time. This was full and curves in, Burns sets up for a drive and does not connect. Finn rips through the bat-pad gap and that's timbaaaah! Stokes to Smith, 1 leg bye full and straight, tickled to the left of the keeper Stokes to Bailey, 1 leg bye shortish length on middle, Bailey looks to swivel-pull again but the ball rolls towards fine leg off the pad Ali to Bailey, OUT and the change works. Maybe a loss in concentration by Bailey but that turned a mile. Beautiful drift by Moeen. Tossed up outside off with plenty of drift, pitches outside off and spins in to beat Bailey's flaying bat and take leg stump. Not only an offspinner's dream ball but a very vital wicket too. Rashid to Smith, OUT oh, he's gone this time. Tame dismissal for Smith. He is distraught, nothing wicket for Rashid. Tossed up nicely outside off and Smith looks to drive through cover but the ball skews to point off the outer half of the bat Ali to Watson, SIX runs massive, massive blow from Watson. Tossed up, Watson nips down the track and punts it forcefully over long-on Woakes to Marsh, 1 wide slung miles wide outside off, past the tram-line Ali to Maxwell, SIX runs What a strike from Maxwell. Full and on off, Maxwell runs down the track and marmalises it over long-off Finn to Maxwell, OUT No fifty for Maxwell. Umpire Dharmasena's finger goes up. Maxwell has a chat with Watson and decides not to review. Nice and full and on middle, Maxwell shuffles across and topples over the flick as he is rapped on the front pad. Trapped in front.. Woakes to Marsh, SIX runs low full toss outside off, Marsh tonks it to the left of long-on for six Stokes to Wade, OUT short, lifting ball outside off. Wade is hurried onto a pull, he skews it in the air off a top edge, which is swallowed by Stokes himself. Simple return catch. The batsmen cross over and Marsh will be on strike Stokes to Marsh, OUT Marsh pops it behind off the last ball of the innings. Short, slower ball down the leg side at 110.4ks. Marsh was far too early into the pull and could only glove it to Buttler. Marsh has done his job, though, muscling Australia past 300 Woakes: It is a good score. If we keep wickets in hand, we have a good chance. I can't say I enjoyed bowling at the death. It was a good challenge. We did a reasonable job at the end. We lost a cluster of wickets in the middle (in the first ODI). Hopefully, we don't do that today. Coulter-Nile to Hales, OUT what a catch. Stunning stuff from Smith. Absolutely stunning. Fuller length outside off, Hales skews the drive off the outer half of the bat towards short cover where Smith is lurking, he dives high to his right to take a spectacular, two-handed catch. Cummins to Morgan, 1 wide bumper down the leg side, Morgan ducks under it with ease Cummins to Morgan, 1 wide slid down the leg side again. Perhaps, Cummins is looking to bust the speedometer even further.. Maxwell to Buttler, OUT an appeal for lbw, Tim Robinson does not budge. Australia want a review. Maxi's front foot is fine. Flighted on middle, with a hint of turn. He misses the defensive push, is beaten on the inside edge and is rapped on the front pad. The ball pitched in line, impact in line, it would have hit the top of middle. Bu Maxwell to Ali, OUT gone this time. Moeen goes. Another rather soft wicket. Moeen gets down to sweep and gets a thick top edge, the ball flies off towards deep square leg who settles under it early and takes an easy catch. Nothing delivery from Maxwell but England in serious trouble now. Cummins to Plunkett, 1 wide down leg this time. Cummins was looking to follow Plunkett who backed away, strays too wide though Among those wickets, was the dismissal of Ben Stokes who was given out obstructing the field. Was he taking evasive action? Did the left hand come out too far as he blocked the ball from hitting the stumps? The third umpire looked at replays and gave him out, which from his point of view and according to me, was the right call. That wicket ce 6.35pm Righto, lots of talking points today. Firstly, it has been an entertaining match. England, like in the first ODI, were on course for good chunks of the chase but lost wickets too frequently to really stand a chance. Lots of starts but a point worth mentioning was Eoin Morgan's fighting innings, a really brisk, clever 85. 7.00pm Steven Smith was booed off the field after his presentation. Lots of interpretations regarding the Stokes' dismissal. Sets up interestingly for the third ODI on Tuesday. Till then, ciao. Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 309 for 7 (Smith 70, Marsh 64, Bailey 54, Stokes 3-60) beat England 245 (Morgan 85, Cummins 4-56) by 64 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia will head to Old Trafford with a 2-0 lead in this series after their 64-run win over England at Lord's. They will also travel to Manchester with David Warner's thumb broken and doubts over his availability for their next Test tour, Shane Watson's calf strained and uncertainty over whether he can play again this series, and the ire of all England after Ben Stokes was controversially given out obstructing the field. As for the scores of the match, Australia rode to the fourth-highest ODI total ever achieved at Lord's - 309 for 7 - thanks to half-centuries from Steven Smith, George Bailey and Mitchell Marsh. Eoin Morgan, who had sent the Australians in under cloudy skies, then did his best to salvage England's chase with a near-run-a-ball 85, but just like in the first ODI, wickets fell and the target was too big. But this was a day when the runs and wickets were almost secondary to the dramatic moments that punctuated proceedings."
"Rashid to Burns, OUT Rashid strikes as Burns hits a full toss straight back to him! Oh dear, Burns has fizzled out, spoilt for choice and he ended up slicing the ball down the track at waist height, Rashid happily accepting the gift to break a very decent opening stand Rashid to Warner, OUT he's got the breakthrough again! Credit to Morgan, as well as Rashid. Brave enough to toss the ball up, might have been a googly, Warner went for a drive and it skews off a thick outside edge to short third man Rashid to Bailey, SIX runs that's a good response! Dispatches a friendly full toss over long-on for the first six of the day. Rashid doesn't get away with this one Rashid to Smith, SIX runs and now it's Smith's turn for a six over long-on, used his feet and lofted with a bit of bottom hand well clear of the rope Rashid to Smith, OUT another full toss, another wicket! Would you believe it! Smith is furious with himself. Was a juicy full toss, Smith was aiming to clear the deep midwicket boundary but couldn't get it wide, or over, Ben Stokes. That's a waste from the Australian captain Rashid to Bailey, OUT and another! Excellent stuff from Rashid. A quicker ball, skids on and just grips a little, Bailey on the back foot aiming through the leg side, misses his shot and is struck on the back leg in front of middle. Nothing flukey about that one. Wood to Maxwell, OUT down the leg side, Maxwell flicks at it... does Buttler take the catch? Was there an edge? Joel Wilson raises his finger and, after some discussion between Maxwell, Watson and the umpires, the batsman heads off. The Big Show leaves the stage early, as replays confirm both the catch and a thin edge. Wood has a wicket, in slightly Stokes to Marsh, 1 leg bye strays slightly leg side but Marsh misses with a glance, rolls away off the pad Marsh to Roy, 1 wide angled down the leg side...first wide of the innings, just the third of the day Maxwell to Roy, OUT steps away and drives, in the air... and taken at point! Maxwell has got Roy, slicing a shot straight to the fielder. Might have skidded on a bit as he was trying to force the ball over the off side - maybe an unnecessary risk, with singles coming regularly, but that's the game and Roy's a goner Coulter-Nile to Rashid, 1 wide dragged wide outside off Cummins to Wood, 1 wide that's sprayed short and way down the leg side And that just about wraps things up for today. Australia take the early lead in the series. It's a quick turnaround. We are back on Saturday for the Lord's match. See you then. From Gnasher and Alan it's goodnight. Player of the match is Matthew Wade, AUS","Australia 305 for 6 (Wade 71*, Warner 59, Rashid 4-59) beat England 246 (Roy 67, Coulter-Nile 2-39, Watson 2-39) by 59 runs Scorecard A seventh-wicket partnership of 112 in 13 overs between Matthew Wade and Mitchell Marsh proved the difference between the sides in the first ODI of the series between England and Australia in Southampton. When the pair came together Australia were precariously placed on 193 for 6 and had just lost three wickets for 15 runs. But Wade, timing the ball as well as anyone, produced his highest ODI score since August 2012 - and his highest ever against a Full Member nation - as Australia added 93 from the final 10 overs. That took Australia's total above 300 and, while the game has changed up to a point, the fact remains that England have only three times successfully chased a target of that magnitude. Only once have they successfully chased a target higher than the one they were set here."
"Hazlewood to Lumb, OUT full length on off stump, Lumb tries to heave over the leg side but puts it straight up in the air and mid-on takes a solid catch. Lively from Lumb but he's totally miscued that trying to pick a ball up over the leg side Hazlewood to Hales, OUT full on the stumps, Hales aims a big swing towards the leg side and gets a huge top edge that swirls down to third man and Starc holds the chance very well. That hung in the air for a long time but Starc steadied himself just inside the boundary and took it down to his left with two hands Muirhead to Root, 1 wide spins well wide of off stump and called so as Root's cut misses, sharp turn there Hazlewood to Broad, 1 wide Broad steps away, this is fired wide of the wicket in respone - too wide for the umpire Hazlewood to Bresnan, OUT bowled him, via his legs! Bresnan tried to get cute, stepping outside off and attempting to dab the ball fine on the leg side, failed to connect with the bat and it clipped his back leg before ricocheting into the stumps Hazlewood to Tredwell, OUT timber! Hazlewood has four! Full and straight does for Tredwell, who tried to launch his first ball down the ground and missed it completely. The stumps are a mess and so is this England innings 9.10pm: England's long tour continues to plough a slough of despond. That was a miserable batting display on a wicket both captains eyed up greedily at the toss. The aggression was naked but England's batsmen were left with barely a fig leaf to cover their wobbly bits by the end. Expect this to be another green-and-gold jamboree, as Victoria toasts its own... Alex will be back in 15 to see if the inevitable eventuates. Bresnan to Bailey, 1 wide bumper, well-directed but too high apparently, they're so harsh on the bowler's nowadays Australia won by 8 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) Player of the match is Josh Hazlewood, AUS","Australia 2 for 131 (Bailey 60*, White 58*) beat England 9 for 130 (Buttler 22, Hazlewood 4-30) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details An unbeaten 58 from Cameron White helped Australia cruise to victory Getty Images As Twenty20 wins go, this was comprehensive. So comprehensive that Brad Hodge did not even get to bat in his first international for nearly six years. The Melbourne fans were disappointed at that, but pleased their other Victorian favourite, Cameron White, played a key part in Australia's pulverisation of England. White and George Bailey feasted on England's lacklustre bowling, cruising to the target of 131 in the 15th over with eight wickets in hand. It meant a third series defeat for England on this tour."
"Chahal to Warner, SIX runs slog sweep into the midwicket crowd! Wow. Leg break, tossed up in the slot, he got down on one knee and took no notice of the man at deep midwicket, he hit in 15 rows back! Shami to Smith, 1 wide slower ball, 121kph, but too wide of off and called wide Hardik to Smith, OUT edged and caught at short third man! This was a wide slower ball, he fell over trying to cut it, got a thick edge and it flew straight to short third man on the circle. Smith is furious but he gets a hug ovation as he walks off Bumrah to Labuschagne, OUT caught at mid off! He picks out the man this time. It was a half volley in the slot, he tried to loft over mid off but nailed it flat and Agarwal takes the catch easily on the circle Hazlewood to S Dhawan, 1 wide short ball down legside and Carey goes up in appeal but the umpire is signalling wide. Dhawan was looking to pull this but it went over his bat. Clear daylight between bat and ball Hazlewood to S Dhawan, OUT easy catch at midwicket. Slower ball possibly, because Dhawan was into his shot too early. Length around off, he was looking to whip it away. Plays it early and the ball loops up for a comfortable take in the circle Henriques to Iyer, 1 wide 122kph, bouncer sails way over the head of Iyer and is called wide Zampa to Iyer, 1 wide 92kph, short wide leg break and it's called wide Henriques to Iyer, OUT brilliant catch by Smith at midwicket! Henriques gets a wicket on return. This was a short slower ball, it stopped in the pitch, Iyer had sit and wait, he whacked a pull shot hard to midwicket, Smith was alert diving full stretch on the circle to his right pulled in a beau Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT Super catch by Henriques at midwicket. Kohli got out in a similar manner in the first ODI and Hazlewood has provided a huge breakthrough. Back of a length, Kohli unleashes a pull while advancing, timed much better than he had in the first ODI, but Henriques at midwicket d Hazlewood to Rahul, SIX runs nails it this time. Another full toss, Rahul backs away this time and flashes a powerful cover drive that travels flat and hard. Ashton Agar at the cover boundary dives to his right but the ball's too quick for him and actually goes all the way Zampa to Rahul, SIX runs down the track and clears long-off. Wasn't hit cleanly, but had enough on it to go just over the long arms of Mitchell Starc at long-off. Zampa to Rahul, OUT and he's finally caught. Hazlewood at short third man has a very easy take. After being nearly caught for two balls in a row, Rahul goes off the third, a routine top edge lobbing up to the fielder. Was swiping across the line again but this was nicely flighted and dipped, got Starc to Hardik, (no ball) holes out to deep midwicket. He had to go for the big hits, but Australia have strangled him. This was dug into the pitch back of a length and he was cramped for room, tried to pull. Couldn't control it. oh wait a minute, it's a no ball. He's overstepped. Pandya stay Zampa to Bumrah, OUT googly, he didn't read it at all and trapped right in front. He was shaping to push into the offside with the ball pitching on off, but it spun back in. He's standing fairly deep too, and struck below the knee roll so it's as plumb as it gets. Crashing into middle stump 10.46 pm Australia take the series with an unbeatable 2-0 lead. Two comprehensive wins, driven by their batting. Both times they put up totals that were just beyond what could be achieved. India's batting was solid enough but they had too much to chase. The bowling will cause some worries. Australia's Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 4 for 389 (Smith 104, Warner 83, Labuschagne 70, Maxwell 63*, Finch 60) beat India 9 for 338 (Kohli 89, Rahul 76, ) by 51 runs During the innings break the host broadcaster crossed for a segment with cricket's one of a kind YouTube curator Rob Moody, in what is set to be a regular feature as he takes viewers through highlights both brilliant and amusing. Moody's memory is near enough to photographic, but in years to come he will be forgiven for confusing elements of the second ODI between Australia and India at the SCG with the first fixture of the series two days before. On both occasions Steven Smith crashed a century from an identical number of balls, on both occasions Australia's batting functioned more or less as the captain Aaron Finch would want it to, and on both occasions India's chase faltered and then petered out after a modicum of a contest into the middle overs. 2:46 Moody: Hazlewood, Zampa difference between two attacks More worryingly for the Australians were parallel losses to injury, as David Warner followed Marcus Stoinis into the treatment room when he pulled up sharply with an apparent groin injury that has the potential to not just scupper his white ball duty but severely affect his Test summer as well. India's salient concerns were less to do with injury than quality of performance; twice now their bowling attack has been severely mauled, an experience shared only by Mitchell Starc on the Australian side."
"7.05pm Hello and welcome to the first T20 between Australia and England as this tour reaches its final leg. First to the toss and Australia have won it and will bat first as the hosts attempt to complete a clean sweep of all the formats. But, writes Daniel Brettig, the T20s provide England with a winning chance. Bresnan to White, 1 wide slides down the leg side with White giving himself room Dernbach to Finch, SIX runs swings again and goes straight over the bowler's head, better timing on this and over the advertising hoarding it goes Bopara to Finch, 1 wide slower ball outside off, called wide but it was inside the guideline outside off and Finch was simply done in the flight Broad to Finch, OUT but this carries to long-on as Finch swung hard at a length ball, aiming at the leg side and didn't get it anywhere near the middle, straight to Hales who took a solid catch Briggs to Maxwell, 1 wide down the leg side for a wide, sharp take from Buttler Wright to White, SIX runs steps to leg and heaves a length ball across the line onto the bank over midwicket Wright to White, OUT full and straight, White swings hard across the line, huge appeal for lbw and given out England needed that badly. Looks pretty straight and struck the pad low, so it looks likely that would have hit leg stump, Hawk Eye has it only clipping but the real time shot looked good Briggs to Maxwell, 1 wide leg side wide Bopara to Maxwell, OUT full on the stumps, goes to reverse slog sweep and chips it to point easy catch for Bresnan. Horrible shot really, he never gets his head down enough does Maxwell. Back of the hand delivery from Bopara does the trick, Maxwell never got under the full delivery Bresnan to Lynn, SIX runs just misses the length and gets whacked over long-off, lovely clean hit Dernbach to Bailey, OUT full delivery outside off out of the back of the hand, swung hard at and gets it straight up in the air and Bresnan takes the catch at point Hazlewood to Wright, 1 wide slings this down the leg side as Wright shuffles across - wide Coulter-Nile to Wright, 1 leg bye hit on the pad, again seaming in but height an issue, Coulter-Nile is a tall man and gets considerable bounce... There's nearly a mix-up as the ball squirts into the off side but they get a leg bye Coulter-Nile to Hales, 1 leg bye good line from Coulter-Nile, nibbles back but a thin inside edge saves the batsman from a plumb lbw shout Muirhead to Buttler, SIX runs full and inviting and Buttler bites, tears off a huge chunk as a slog-sweep disappears into the stands at deep midwicket - England's first six Hazlewood to Bopara, SIX runs low full toss and Bopara plays a delightful lofted drive over long-off and Bopara now has the fastest T20 fifty for England That's all from Hobart, two more games to come in this series, Melbourne on Friday and Sydney on Sunday, same time, same channel you be sure of it, bye for now... Player of the match is Cameron White, AUS","Australia 4 for 213 (White 75, Finch 52) beat England 9 for 200 (Bopara 65*, Coulter-Nile 4-30) by 13 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:26 'More futile runs for Bopara' More than 400 runs made for an entertaining start to the Twenty20 series - and a tough night for the bowlers - but Australia were more comfortable winners than the 13-run margin suggested in Hobart. By the time Ravi Bopara went on a late six-hitting surge, England (who would dearly have loved one of those blows the other night in Adelaide) were out of contention although Australia will have been grateful that they had as many as 4 for 213 to work with. Their total, on a pristine pitch and with one boundary of barely 50 yards towards the building site, was set up by an opening stand of 106 in less than 10 overs between Aaron Finch and Cameron White. Who needs David Warner? For a while it looked like Finch would replicate his record-breaking hundred at the Ageas Bowl last year, when he slammed 156, so there will have been a degree of relief from England when he was cut-off for the small matter of 52 off 31 balls but considerable damage had already been done. White top-scored on his return to the international scene with 75 off 43 balls to strengthen claims for a place in the World Twenty20 squad."
"Bresnan to Clarke, OUT all over for Clarke! The pressure brings another breakthrough. Clarke tried to heave a length ball through the leg side, it was a pretty ugly shot and takes a bottom edge into off stump which ends up out of the ground Bresnan to Bailey, 1 leg bye this time the fuller ball slides down leg and I think it went off the pads as he looked to glance it down. Stokes to Marsh, OUT and he's done it! Marsh has clipped it straight to short midwicket! He's been setting a foundation, but that should might not have been part of the plan. Innocuous length ball on the pads and it was there to be whipped away through the leg side. Perhaps it might have come a little slower o Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye shortish and on the hips as he works it away towards fine leg Stokes to Bailey, 1 leg bye very tight single but Bailey makes it, courtesy the throw being deflected off his bat as he was grounding it. He'd missed the flick and Maxwell calls him through. Stokes gets to the ball quickly but can't strike the stumps direct Stokes to Maxwell, 1 leg bye stifled appeal as this is full and pushed into the pads of Maxwell. Was always going down leg Broad to Wade, OUT oh, Wade has been bowled behind his legs! Wade has been walking across his stumps quite often in this innings, this time he doesn't get bat on Ball and Broad pitches it just outside leg and it goes on with the angle to take the leg stump Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye Coulter-Nile tries to hoick this over leg but another one just dribbles off the leg for a leg bye Jordan to Faulkner, OUT Jordan gets this one too full but it's brought him a wicket! Faulkner's eyes light up with a full toss at knee height, he's got it high out towards midwicket but hasn't got enough on it to clear the fielder, who takes a comfortable catch. Jordan to Coulter-Nile, OUT and Jordan finds himself on a hat-trick after getting this one fast and straight enough to have Coulter-Nile lbw trying to walk across and force it through leg. That looked pretty plumb at first glance. Well, that really was some excellent bowling from England, especially in those last few overs when they just didn't give the batsmen anything much to hit. The early wickets set the tone and Australia could never quite get themselves back into rhythm. George Bailey made a half-century but fell trying to lift the rate. McKay to Cook, 1 wide full and wide outside off, left alone Coulter-Nile to Bell, OUT from beauty to the beast! The danger of driving on this pitch, it wasn't a half volley and Bell tried to go on the up and only succeeded in spooning a catch to mid-off. Careless really from Bell, having already been given warning signs with a couple of leading edges. Faulkner to Stokes, 1 leg bye short delivery, goes for the pull and beaten by a lack of pace as he's through his shot early Coulter-Nile to Cook, OUT he's spooned it to short cover! Coulter-Nile is elated as he sends the England captain packing. It was a good length ball, but Cook was early into his drive through the covers. He tried removing the bottom hand off the bat, but that didn't help as the ball strikes the blade a little t Watson to Morgan, SIX runs slapped straight over the top, that's the first six of the game! Watson overpitches this time and the left-hander was waiting for it. Strides forward and unleashes a full swing of the bat Faulkner to Morgan, OUT there's the wicket Australia needed! And it's Morgan, he's driven this uppishly - but not uppishly enough - to mid-off. He looked like he was trying to clear the field but it's just sailed into the hands of Watson for an easy catch Faulkner to Root, OUT oh boy, now Root is gone! Does this match have a twist in the ending? Root has walked across his stumps and tried to paddle down to fine leg but he didn't get much on it and Doherty at short fine leg in the circle had no trouble taking that Coulter-Nile to Buttler, OUT Buttler is gone now! England are digging themselves into a hole here! A shortish ball from Coulter-Nile gets Buttler's eyes lighting up and he goes for the pull, it comes out of the middle of the bat but not with enough elevation and McKay at deep midwicket takes the catch Coulter-Nile to Bresnan, SIX runs Bresnan gives England some breathing space! He's lifted this off middle and leg and got enough bat on that to clear the boundary at wide midwicket, much-needed six that for England! McKay to Bopara, OUT beaten outside off! Bopara has again just tried to tickle it away and doesn't get bat on ball. In fact there's a stumping appeal. Has Bopara lifted his foot? Oh this is close. Wade hasn't whipped the bails off, the ball has just ricocheted off him down onto the top of the bails. The third Watson to Tredwell, 1 leg bye Tredwell tries to lift this over midwicket but can't connect, but they scramble through for a leg bye Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS","Australia 9 for 217 (Bailey 56, Broad 3-31, Stokes 3-43) beat England 212 (Root 55, Coulter-Nile 3-34, McKay 3-37) by five runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:43 'Familiar story with England on Australia Day thriller' Brilliant for much of this summer, Australia settled for simply being the lucky country on their national day, as a fortuitous moment at the pointy end of the final ODI effectively handed the hosts a fourth limited-overs victory out of five over England and a ninth from 10 encounters including the Ashes clean sweep. In a scrappy contest dictated largely by the sluggishness of Adelaide Oval's drop-in pitch, Australia posted a mediocre total but defended it grandly against an England team who threatened to take control at several stages of the chase but could never quite manage to wrest command of the evening. Alastair Cook, Joe Root and Eoin Morgan all contributed useful scores to take England close, but it was left to Ravi Bopara to try to take his team to a second win in a row. He seemed likely to carry them there, until falling victim to a most unfortunate end, as Matthew Wade's fumble behind the stumps bounced back onto the leg bail with the batsman's foot barely raised. The Australians celebrated their win raucously and fittingly - it was one more moment of joy in a summer brimful of them, while England rued the swings of outrageous fortune that inevitably seem to go against the side to fall behind."
"Pattinson to Bell, 1 wide now this is fired down the leg side...another wide Maxwell to Cook, OUT breakthrough! Another start not built on for Cook. Goes for the slog sweep, played over the top of the ball and it hits off stump. Was quite full for the shot. There may have been a little bottom edge. Maxwell does the trick again. Christian to Bell, 1 wide Christian gets the line wrong now, down leg side for a wide Christian to Bell, OUT Bell is gone! Oh, he'll be so frustrated at himself here. It was a bad ball down leg and Bell goes for the glance but fine leg is up in the circle and takes the catch easily! That didn't look like a plan from the Australians, just a fortuitous piece of, well, fortune. Christian to Stokes, 1 wide Stokes slashes hard outside off and this again is too wide from Christian - umpire Dharmasena is not having that Pattinson to Ballance, OUT that will boost Pattinson. Banged in a short, Ballance goes for the pull and gets a meaty top edge which goes now further than cover where Smith negotiates the sun to hold the catch Faulkner to Stokes, OUT big wicket! Stokes tries to lap-sweep a slower ball but can only get a top edge that loops behind him and Matthew Wade trots around for the catch. They check the no-ball, it's very tight but is just okay. Bit close for comfort. Faulkner to Buttler, 1 wide short ball from Faulkner and a delayed wide call by the umpire Johnson to Morgan, 1 wide down leg side now and that will be called a wide - Morgan went the big hook but couldn't connect Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 wide Buttler tries to turn this one down fine leg but gets nothing on it - this is called a wide by Dharmasena and that seems a tough call, Buttler walked across his stumps and this was barely down leg at all Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 wide bouncer from Coulter-Nile and Buttler shapes to hook then backs out - it's called a wide Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs another six, and this is starting to get away from Australia - Morgan went the slog off Faulkner and it turns into a top edge that flies away with the wind and over the head of fine leg Faulkner to Morgan, OUT Morgan is gone, he has flicked a low full toss from Faulkner to midwicket where Christian takes a pretty straightforward catch. Faulkner to Buttler, OUT Buttler's entertaining innings comes to an end, he's swung hard outside off and this slices off the top edge and flies away towards third man where Johnson comes in and takes the catch Faulkner to Bresnan, OUT another catch at third man! Would you believe it? Bresnan has sliced this one off the edge and Johnson makes good ground to his left to take the catch Welcome back folks. Can England win one? We'll find out over the next three or so hours. The players are back out there. Chris Jordan to bowl the first over. Tredwell to Finch, SIX runs well, Finch is still seeing it pretty well! He's clubbed Tredwell over long-on for six more, clean hitting this Stokes to Bailey, OUT down leg side and this flicks something on the way through to Buttler. It sounded thuddy as if it was pad, and the caught-behind appeal is turned down. England want a review. Well, this is very interesting. The front-on view didn't seem to support the review but Hot Spot has shown something. A cl Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye gets a long way across his stumps, England excited for a moment but not really close to a good shout as the ball deflects to square leg Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 wide tries to follow him with a bouncer, but it's too short and is called another wide Bresnan to Maxwell, 1 wide attempted slower-ball bouncer and it gives away another wide down the leg side as Maxwell misses his pull...priceless for Australia. Maxwell, though, was actually beaten by the change of pace Jordan to Christian, SIX runs stunning strike! Stand and deliver. It was a length ball which Christian sent way over long-on. A lovely shot, nothing like a slog. Stokes to Christian, 1 leg bye worked away off the pads for a leg bye Stokes to Faulkner, OUT another wicket and it's the big one! Faulkner will not be the hero today. The extra bounce has done for Faulkner as it did for Maxwell. Faulkner backs off a touch and tries to slash through off and a top edge sails safely through to Buttler Jordan to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide wrong line for Jordan though as he strays down leg So there you have it - England have avoided what would have been an equal record 10th straight loss across all formats for them. It's their first win of the tour in a full international. Yes, the series is dead, and yes, Australia have rested four of their best players, but at this point England will take anything. It was a Player of the match is Ben Stokes, ENG","England 8 for 316 (Buttler 71, Stokes 70, Bell 55, Faulkner 4-67) beat Australia 259 (Finch 108, Stokes 4-38) by 57 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ben Stokes followed up 70 with the bat by taking four wickets in England's first win over Australia on tour Getty Images It has happened. It's not an apparition. England have beaten Australia. After 91 days on a gut-wrenching tour that has brought defeat and despair, they can at least remind themselves what winning a cricket match feels like after securing a 57-run victory at the WACA. Two players with huge roles to play in the future were central to the success."
"Coulter-Nile to Cook, SIX runs dropped in short and Cook responds with a thumping pull shot, in front of square and it clears the deep square-leg boundary...positive signs from the England captain Coulter-Nile to Cook, OUT gone this time! Just went it appeared things had turned for Cook he drives off the back foot to a short of a length delivery and Maxwell dives to his right at cover to hold a good catch. He was right to attack that delivery, just didn't get over he top of the shot. Doherty to Stokes, OUT Clarke has taken a stunner at square leg! Holy moly batsman, that is a remarkable catch! Stokes has gone for the sweep and smoked it out of the middle of the bat, Clarke at square leg has had to react instantly and does so, dives to his right and thrusts the right hand low to the ground and the bal Coulter-Nile to Ballance, OUT Coulter-Nile makes the breakthrough, and it's a rather poor piece of placement from Ballance. He's got some width and went the cut shot but sliced it upwards and Christian was out at deep point and ran in to take a reasonably comfortable catch Faulkner to Jordan, OUT this time he picks out the fielder...another good catch. Jordan trying to go over the leg side again, gets height but not the distance - needed to fetch it from outside off - and Finch steadied himself at deep square-leg Jordan to Warner, 1 wide swings down leg side and that is called a wide Broad to Finch, 1 wide down leg side and Finch can't get anything on it, so that's a wide Jordan to Finch, 1 wide England just can't get their bowling right - this is yet another one skewed down leg for a wide Bopara to Marsh, 1 leg bye an appeal for lbw from Bopara, but no else...it pitched outside leg Tredwell to Warner, SIX runs all the way...Warner couldn't resist any longer, he goes down on one knee and slog-sweeps over deep midwicket Broad to Haddin, SIX runs well now, Haddin is not waiting! He wants this over as quickly as possible, he just backs off a touch and slogs this over cow corner, with such timing that it's cleared the boundary for six So there you have it, Clarke has foreshadowed that Warner may well set out of the next couple of matches. Clarke also says he is likely to sit out of the Perth match now that the series has been won. That would mean George Bailey would captain the side, if he is fit again. Join us for that match on Friday. Until then, from Bryd So there you have it, Australia have won this match with ten overs to spare and seven wickets in hand, a comprehensive victory to give them the series with two matches still to play. It's the first time for a long time that a team has followed an Ashes triumph with a victory in the one-day series straight afterwards - England's Australia won by 7 wickets (with 60 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 3 for 244 (Marsh 71*, Warner 71) beat England 9 for 243 (Morgan 54, Coulter-Nile 3-47) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details As Brad Haddin observed the day before this match, winning is a habit and so is losing. On the evidence of an SCG contest that ended with Australia wrapping up their second consecutive ODI series victory over England in the minimum three matches, the hosts' predilection for the former is matched by their visitors' weakness for the latter. Though less dramatic and perhaps less demoralising than James Faulkner's Gabba heist had been, this defeat underlined England's rut and Australia's peak as well as any of the seven previous matches on the tour. Alastair Cook's side won the toss on a pitch favouring the side batting first and made a swift start, yet found themselves fatally slowed as much by their own lack of conviction as Australia's neat bowling and high class fielding. Australia's chase was not quite perfect, as no batsman made a hundred and wickets were lost to loose strokes, but the belief surging through the team was demonstrated by the jaunty run rate pursued throughout, and best exemplified by the sight of David Warner swinging a six down the ground the over after Aaron Finch's dismissal playing a similarly full-blooded stroke."
"Hello all, welcome to the second ODI at the Gabba. The news from the middle is that England have won the toss and will bat. They have also gone in with an unchanged side from the Melbourne ODI, despite the loss there. A win against the Prime Minister's XI might just have given them a little of the confidence that has been lacking. McKay to Bell, 1 wide plenty of swing here for McKay but again it's too much movement - this one curves too wide of off and is called a wide Johnson to Cook, 1 wide and Johnson now finds what McKay has already discovered - it ain't easy controlling this swing. This one curves well wide of off and almost to first slip. Wide signalled by umpire John Ward, who is on his ODI debut McKay to Bell, 1 leg bye worked away to the leg side Maxwell to Cook, OUT Maxwell strikes! Around the wicket to Cook, who drives at a half-volley but does nothing more than send it back in the direction of the bowler, who takes a sharp catch low to his right. Cook will be kicking himself! Johnson to Root, OUT Johnson gets Root! It seemed inevitable, and it's an lbw that gets him. Johnson gets this one to swing back in a fraction, at pace, and the only thing as slow as Root's attempt to get the bat down in time is Dharmasena's delayed decision to give that out. As he did in the first ODI, Root wants a review and as was the case then, he is still out. It was an umpire's call, replays suggestin Maxwell to Ballance, OUT and Maxwell beats an increasingly fidgety Ballance as he lofts one just around off stump, with the flight drawing Ballance down the track before the left-hander, trying to work this leg side, misses the ball completely, and turns around just in time to see Haddin collect the ball and whip the bails off. Maxwell strikes again and suddenly England seemed to have lost their way at 78 f McKay to Morgan, SIX runs and the first six of the innings is brought to you by Morgan as he shimmies down the track before clubbing McKay right back over long-on with the easiest of swings Faulkner to Bell, OUT in the blockhole as Bell plays this with soft hands before setting off for one. He is turned back immediately by Morgan when he sees Clarke advancing on it, who picks it up and fires in a throw which has Bell diving for safety, but the bat bounces off the pitch as he looks to ground it. The throw beats Bell's dive handsomely, and just like that Bell is gone for a well-fought 68 Johnson to Bopara, 1 wide length pitched wide outside off as this time the umpire is snapped back into attention as he signals a wide Coulter-Nile to Bopara, SIX runs Bopara gets hold of this one! Lovely timing as he hits through the line and lifts Coulter-Nile over long-on for six, just a really clean strike Faulkner to Bopara, OUT Bopara's gone! He's tried to flick Faulkner through the leg side but has managed only to chip it up to George Bailey at short midwicket, straightforward catch and England are in a spot of bother now Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 wide Coulter-Nile goes the bouncer and this one has been called a wide - just a touch too high Faulkner to Morgan, SIX runs powerful shot! Morgan has crunched Faulkner over long-on with such good timing and strength that it's made it ten rows back in the crowd, he could really get England's total moving here Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 1 leg bye once again Coulter-Nile does well to follow Buttler as he backs away, can only manage a leg bye Coulter-Nile to Buttler, 2 wide down leg this time as Coulter-Nile tries to follow the batsman but goes too far Coulter-Nile to Stokes, OUT Stokes is gone first ball! He's tried to launch this over the leg side and finds the man at deep midwicket, another one for Coulter-Nile Faulkner to Morgan, OUT Morgan gets a low full toss and miscues it, finds the man at deep mid-off and that's the end of a wonderful innings of 106, Morgan has really given England's bowlers a strong target to defend Jordan to Warner, OUT Jordan takes a spectacular return catch to remove the dangerous Warner as the left-hander hammers back a length ball to the right of Jordan, who instinctively stretches out his hand to grab hold of the chance. Amazing that it even managed to stick, especially with how hard Warner had struck that back. Removes a dangerous thorn in the backside for the English Stokes to Marsh, 1 wide Stokes bangs in a bouncer but it's too short - that's a wide Jordan to Maxwell, 1 leg bye leg bye is all that Maxwell can manage as Jordan aims at the leg-stump Bresnan to Coulter-Nile, 1 leg bye Coulter-Nile swings hard and can't get it away but they hurry through for a tight leg bye Stokes to Faulkner, 1 wide going down the leg side as the umpire calls a wide Stokes to Coulter-Nile, OUT gets one to swing in from just outside off as Nathan goes for the big heave down the ground, but misses the ball as this careens low into his right pad, which is definitely in line of the stumps. Doesn't look to have got an inside-edge as this one continued onto the pads, so fairplay to the Australians for not wasting the review Bopara to Johnson, 1 wide again down the same line, but a tad wider Have you returned yet from the clouds? What a win this was for Australia as Faulkner proved that the Mohali heist was not a one-off. Can't recall a greater eruption from an Australian crowd in recent years. England will be slightly shell-shocked by what has just transpired, but they will need to pick themselves up by the straps and get mentally ready for the 3rd ODI, which will be played in Sydney in two days' tim Australia won by 1 wicket (with 3 balls remaining) Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS","Australia 9 for 301 (Faulkner 69*, Marsh 55, Maxwell 54) beat England 8 for 300 (Morgan 106, Bell 68) by 1 wicket Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:14 Ehantharajah: What have England done to deserve James Faulkner? Just when England's grim, debilitating tour looked as though it would have a moment of relief, James Faulkner carried Australia to a heart-stopping one-wicket victory at the Gabba with three balls to spare. Left with No. 11 Clint McKay for company and 57 runs still needed, Faulkner calmly turned down singles and backed himself to find the required boundaries, which he did with regularity as he knocked off the final 25 needed in seven deliveries. He hit five sixes in total, including two in the penultimate over off Ben Stokes (who Faulkner hit for all his sixes), then closed out the match with three consecutive boundaries in the final over from Tim Bresnan to leave England shattered and now facing the prospect of another whitewash. Bresnan appeared to have calmed England nerves with two wickets in the 35th over - Brad Haddin taken at mid-off and Glenn Maxwell swinging to midwicket - but he could not defend 12 when it came to the crunch."
"McKay to Cook, OUT full length, Cook feels for it just outside off and nicks it low to Haddin and once again Alistair Cook has fallen early in the piece. It's a decent delivery, tighter line again from the previous delivery which was left, forcing Cook t McKay to Root, 1 wide wide, too wide, a wide McKay to Root, OUT full at the pads, Root misses and is struck on the pad, looks pretty straight and given out lbw. We do have reviews available and Root goes upstairs. There were two noises but it doesn't appear as if Root has hit this, nothing on Hot S Maxwell to Bell, SIX runs tossed up outside off and Bell slog sweeps it into the stands, lovely timing Doherty to Bell, OUT slog swept, missed completely and Bell is bowled. He nailed one into the stands previously but this is to a ball angled in, cramping Bell for room and it hurried onto him and his swipe across the line failed to gain any connection Coulter-Nile to Bopara, OUT back of a length that just bounces on Bopara looking to stay leg side and flick to leg, it angled in and takes the glove on the way through to Haddin Faulkner to Stokes, OUT another swing to leg, misses and this time loses his middle and off bail. Two previous attempts at that leg side heave failed and it's third time unlucky as this miss costs him his wicket, Faulkner finally finding the timbers 5.40pm, tea A late surge from Buttler has given England a handy score. It was a patient beginning and early wickets saw the tourists in trouble again but first Eoin Morgan and then Gary Ballance played lively innings to give England some progress and Buttler's Morning/afternoon, AG here. England are trying to find their way out of the seven circles and have 269 to defend - a respectable score, largely built through half-centuries from Gary Ballance and Eoin Morgan. Australia's response will give us an indicator of w Pocket rocket David Warner and backpack bully Aaron Finch are out in the middle, Boyd Rankin has one of the new balls in hand. Jordan to Warner, 1 wide shapes down the leg side, little bit of swing, called wide Jordan to Warner, 1 wide again this slides down the leg side, quickish 87mph, but wide again Rankin to Finch, 1 wide strays down the leg side, Finch plays across the line and misses but it's a wide Jordan to Finch, 1 wide slips down the leg side, past bat and pads - another wide Root to Finch, 1 wide this is down leg side Jordan to Watson, OUT full and it nips back past the drive and knocks out off stump. Reward for Jordan who has been impressive despite England's predicament. A beauty this is, full enough to draw Watson into the drive and a bit of in-duck off the seam t Jordan to Finch, 1 wide zings another length delivery down the leg side - more to the extras column Stokes to Finch, OUT bottom hand comes off the bat, a sliced drive soars down to third man... and, me oh my, Ballance pouches it! A wicket for Stokes, a catch for Ballance and a standing salute for Finch. If the same fielder had taken a much easier chan Bresnan to Clarke, OUT got him, another one late in the piece! Clarke went aggressively at the ball, wasn't quite there to drive and it hit high up the bat, looping to mid-off. Cook takes the catch, again thinking to himself 'What if?' Stokes to Maxwell, 1 wide slower ball, possibly out the back of the hand, dribbles down the leg side Bresnan to Maxwell, 2 runs back of a length, swatted in front of deep midwicket, they'll get back for two meaning Australia win by six wickets and go 1-0 up in the series Okay, folks, that's yer lot for today. Brydon Coverdale's report should be your next stop and then Plays of the Day, why not? If you're in England, Sunday is your oyster; those in the Antipodes should slug a green grenade and then get to bed - remember you've Australia won by 6 wickets (with 26 balls remaining) Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 4 for 270 (Finch 121, Warner 65) beat England 7 for 269 (Ballance 79, Morgan 50, McKay 3-44) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:10 Ehantharajah: England's top order fails to convince Aaron Finch is becoming Australia's post-Ashes specialist. Four days after the end of the Ashes in England, the teams reconvened in Southampton for the first of the short-form matches and Finch broke the all-time record for the highest Twenty20 international score with 156. This time, one week after Australia completed their 5-0 Ashes clean sweep, Finch became the first Victorian to score an ODI hundred at the MCG as Australia cruised to a six-wicket win with 26 balls to spare. If England hoped that a change of fortunes would accompany their change of format and clothing, they were mistaken. Things looked okay for a while."
"Saini to Finch, 1 wide 139kph, bouncer, too high and called wide Jadeja to Finch, 1 wide goes down legside so he'll have to rebowl that Chahal to Finch, SIX runs nails the slog across the line. The length was too full that time from Chahal, and Finch spotted that, took a confident stride out and whacked it across the line and over the deep midwicket fence Bumrah to Warner, (no ball) and Bumrah lets Warner know that he's not here just to make up numbers. Excellent bouncer, outside off, Warner sways out of the way Shami to Warner, OUT huge appeal for a catch by the keeper and not given. Kohli has gone for the review. Yorker length ball, shaping away a touch, his bat hit ground as the ball went past and Rahul had an easy take. And there is a spike as the ball goes past the outside edge with the bat not yet Shami to Smith, 1 wide slower ball bouncer, Smith sways under it, it's called wide for height. Tough call. Looked tight Shami to Finch, 1 leg bye 136kph, good length angled into the hip, it comes off pad and it rolls away for a leg bye Bumrah to Finch, OUT An attempted ramp goes wrong! He lobs a catch to Rahul. It was a bouncer that just sat up above his head, he tried to ramp it over Rahul but he just lobbed it up off the face of the bat to Rahul Chahal to Stoinis, OUT caught behind! A top-spinner outside off, Stoinis goes back and tried to punch off the back foot, gets an edge and Rahul takes an excellent catch Chahal to Maxwell, SIX runs Tipped over the rope by Hardik Pandya at wide long off! Tossed up outside off, Maxwell launched this hard and flat to wide long off, Hardik was in off the rope, he had to back pedal a touch, he jumped up with one hand but just tipped it up and over for six Shami to Maxwell, OUT caught at long on! Straight down Jadeja's throat and he doesn't let it go! Full outside off, he swatted this hard and flat but didn't get the elevation, Jadeja was in off the rope but he didn't have to move Saini to Labuschagne, OUT holed out to long off! Slower ball does the trick, 116kph, Labuschagne lofted it high but into the wind to long off, Dhawan comes around and takes it easily 10m in from the rope Shami to Smith, OUT bowled him! A low full toss, on off stump, Smith backed away and tried to open the face to slice it behind point but he got a little nick and it crashed into off stump. He was furious he missed out there but a fabulous innings nonetheless Starc to Agarwal, 5 wide oh that's gone waaaay down leg. Completely lost control of that Starc, might have been a wide to a left-hander outside off too, it was that far down leg. No chance for Carey, five wides to India Starc to Agarwal, 1 wide still not getting his radar right, goes back the other way, outside the right-hander's off, but it's too wide outside off Hazlewood to Agarwal, OUT caught at point. The bowler out-thinks the batsman in that one. Agarwal stepped away again, looking to thrash this over cover, but Hazlewood banged it in short this time and followed the batsman. Agarwal ended up not in the best position and his slash went off the top edg Cummins to Kohli, SIX runs imperious. That is just a fabulous shot. Goes across slightly and the length ball ends up on his thigh pad, he plays a pick-up shot that is timed so well it soars over the square leg boundary. Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT caught at midwicket Superb bowling and field placement. Kohli was advancing down the track again, Hazlewood kept it back of a length, and bowled into Kohli, who could only get it off the high part of his bat as he tried to pull. The ball plops to Finch, and the Australians Hazlewood to Iyer, OUT snorter does him in. Iyer will not want to watch a replay of that. Hazlewood dug this in short and rising sharply towards his head. An ungainly attempt to get out of the way by Iyer, but his bat was hanging in the air like a periscope above his head. The ball balloons off it Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 wide length ball sliding down legside and that'll be a wide Cummins to S Dhawan, 1 wide tries to bowl a bouncer on the free hit but it's down legside and a wide. So it's still a free hit Zampa to Hardik, SIX runs launched over long on! Zampa tossed it up bravely and Hardik's eyes light up. He took one step and smashed it way back into the crowd at long on Maxwell to Hardik, SIX runs he gets this one into the square leg stands! This was a similar ball on leg, he picked it up with the spin and put it 20 rows back Zampa to Hardik, 1 wide backing away to leg and Zampa does well to keep it inside the tramline outside off. Hardik can't reach that and doesn't even try Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 6 for 374 (Finch 114, Smith 105, Warner 69, Maxwell 45, Shami 3-59) beat India 8 for 308 (Pandya 90, Dhawan 74, Zampa 4-54, Hazlewood 3-55) by 66 runs Australia's first match of a Covid-19 international summer that might have begun in Perth, Brisbane or Adelaide before finally settling upon the grand old SCG was fitting in that it was both bracingly uneven and also a commanding victory for a home side that was as organised as the logistical efforts that had allowed the series to get underway in the first place. A backbone century from Aaron Finch and a blistering one from Steven Smith, coupled with characteristic contributions from David Warner and Glenn Maxwell, vaulted Australia to an imposing 6 for 374, before India's chase was unable to maintain the runaway momentum of a beginning that benefitted from a rare case of Mitchell Starc losing control of the ball. The hosts were concerned primarily by a side problem that afflicted Marcus Stoinis - in a tight schedule his injury may open a path for Moises Henriques or Cameron Green. Aaron Finch and Steven Smith put up a strong partnership Getty Images For a couple of passages in particular: the 25 balls in which Maxwell accompanied Smith and then the 21 faced by Virat Kohli, the game touched moments of the greatest possible theatre. But these interludes were fleeting, and fell either side of a more dominant theme, that of Australia's ODI team imposing their greater sense of settled system and home comfort against an Indian side that will be battling both foreign conditions and increasing extremes of isolation after decamping to the IPL as distantly as three months ago."
"7.10pm Australia have won the toss and will bat, George Bailey is grinning again, as he does. Australia have made two changes, with Chris Lynn, er, rested and Josh Hazlewood dropping out for Daniel Christian and Ben Cutting. England also make two changes, Jordan replacing James Tredwell and Ben Stokes in for Michael Lumb, with Luke Wri Jordan to White, 1 wide and he starts with a wide, firing this narrowly down the leg side Stokes to Finch, SIX runs clubbed over deep backward square, that's a monstrous flick from Finch, the first six of the innings! He came forward out of the crease, made the delivery a half-volley on his pads, but the nonchalance with which he launched the ball over the rope was astounding Stokes to Finch, SIX runs six more, into the crowd at long-on! Overptiched from Stokes and he's taken downtown by the little big man again, crrrrrrrrrrrrunched back over his head Bresnan to Finch, SIX runs here goes Finch again - he loves playing against England - carting a slightly fill ball out towards wide long-on, Hales gets round to it but appeared uncertain where the boundary was and compounds his drop but sending it beyond the rope. Tough but takeable Bresnan to Finch, OUT on the attack, doesn't get hold of a pull and plops the ball to mid-on! England have got their aggressor, Bresnan winkles him out with a half-tracker, miscalculation from Finch, who tried to pull from outside off, maybe wasn't quite short enough either and spooned to the fielder Stokes to Maxwell, 1 wide spears this down the leg side - wide Stokes to Cutting, SIX runs full on the stumps, another lovely swing down the ground, clears long-off this time, managed to play it inside out against the angle, sweetly timed Root to Cutting, OUT down the track, punches firmly back towards the bowler but Root reaches out to his left and clings onto a rifling chance that was struck very well but evidently too straight and Root intervened to perfect effect Dernbach to Bailey, FOUR runs full and wide of off stump, Bailey reaches out and hammers this wide of deep cover, that almost carried for six as well What a final over from Bailey and has taken Australia from what was only a par score to a very good total, England would not have been expecting to chase above 190 when they took a flurry of wickets to reduce Australia to 139 for 6 with four overs to go. But Bailey's blinder puts Australia in the box seat for another win and Monty will Starc to Wright, OUT drops short, pulled... straight to deep square leg! So Wright gets another single-figure score, despite moving up the order, he was in position to play the shot, went aerial but can't have been looking at the field. Cutting did a two-step to his right and then settled for the take Maxwell to Stokes, OUT heave ho, off he goes, a loopy leading edge caught on the edge of the ring! Stokes laid the dynamite but only succeeded in blowing himself up, swinging hard and falling harder, the ball looped towards point and Cutting took an excellent catch back-pedalling Christian to Morgan, SIX runs goes round the wicket, Morgan moves outside the line and plays an audacious scoop over fine leg! Clever batting and that's six more Cutting to Morgan, OUT length ball swung to leg, Morgan doesn't get all of this, in comes Starc from deep square leg, dives forward and takes the catch but of course when it's close, which this is, they will go upstairs to have a check and there's every chance this could be overturned but thankfully not because the catch looked Coulter-Nile to Bopara, OUT huge swing at a full ball, gets a huge inside edge into his pad and it trickles slowly into leg stump and that is a very unfortunate way to go. The ball cannoned of the inside of his pad and agonisingly rolled steadily towards the stumps, glanced the base of the leg stick and off dropped the bail Muirhead to Bresnan, OUT swing outside off, misses courtesy of the turn, Wade has the bails off and there's a strong appeal for a stumping and Wade was sharp to remove the bails as Bresnan dragged his bag foot a good two inches out of his ground and fails to get back in time Right, at long last this series is over and may Australia and England not play each other for a very long time! We've had enough fixtures to last a lifetime in this past eight months. But both teams are in action again pretty soon with Australia travelling to South Africa for a mouthwatering Test series and England back in action at th Player of the match is George Bailey, AUS","Australia 6 for 195 (Bailey 49*, Broad 3-30) beat England 111 (Morgan 34, Muirhead 2-13) by 84 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details There was talk that England had chartered a plane to fly them out of Sydney immediately after this match. Who could blame them? Beaten, bullied and broken by the Australians in the Tests and ODIs, England finished their tour with another heavy loss, this time by 84 runs, in the final T20. It meant another clean sweep for Australia. It meant across all formats, Australia had crushed England 12-1 this summer. The 1 was an ODI in which Australia rested several key players."
"Hodge to Rohit Sharma, OUT Hodge has the last laugh against Rohit! Very soft dismissal, tossed up outside off, Rohit aims to clear cover, he gets an outside edge that tamely lobs up to point Maxwell to Kohli, 1 wide he fires this wide down the leg side Maxwell to Kohli, SIX runs that came out of nowhere! After a few quiet deliveries Kohli gets on his knee and slogs him high and quick over deep midwicket, tremendous bat speed there Starc to Rahane, 1 wide he fires this wide down the leg side, tries to flick Muirhead to Kohli, OUT Muirhead strikes second ball! He isn't afraid to toss this up, draws Kohli out of the crease and he lofts down the ground, he can't clear long-off though, taken by White at the edge of the circle Bollinger to Rahane, OUT Rahane had steered quite a few to third man with success earlier but he wasn't so lucky this time, Bollinger got a nice angle across the right-hander, Rahane looked to guide this to third man, cramped for room and outside edge easily taken by the keeper Maxwell to Raina, OUT finds long-on! India have lost the form batsman, he went down the track and looked to clear long-on but didn't get the elevation, easy catch for Finch Watson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye another short one and he was too early on the pull, ended up gloving it towards the keeper Muirhead to Yuvraj, SIX runs another short ball murdered! This is terrible bowling, flat and sits up for Yuvraj to pull this over long-on Starc to Dhoni, 1 wide he drifts wide down the leg side Starc to Yuvraj, 1 wide Starc loses control of that and fires it wide down the leg side Starc to Dhoni, OUT Starc comes round the wicket to Dhoni and fires that on the stumps, Dhoni made room to clear cover and missed, the ball hits the middle stump Starc to Yuvraj, 1 leg bye another low full toss he fails to put away, this was swinging in, looked an inside edge to the pads Watson to Yuvraj, OUT Yuvraj fails to last till the end but he'll go back feeling very satisfied nevertheless, this was pitched up outside off, he scoops this straight to Maxwell at long-off, a bit more on it and he would have cleared the rope Watson to Ashwin, (no ball) it's an overstep! From round the wicket, low full toss and Ashwin misses out by edging it to the pads, he has another chance with the Free hit Bhuvneshwar to Warner, 1 leg bye this is pitched well outside leg, and goes for a leg-bye Sharma to Watson, OUT Was he bowled or not? Dhoni was up to the stumps, Mohit cramped Watson for room as he looked to angle it to third man, the ball came in and the leg lights were flashing, even Dhoni wasn't sure if the ball deflected off him to the stumps instead, Watson stands his ground and the umpires check wit Sharma to Maxwell, 1 leg bye slower ball nudged to the on side Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs Maxwell and deep midwicket - inseparable, Jadeja errs by tossing it on the pads and he sends it several rows over the rope Ashwin to Maxwell, OUT freak dismissal for Maxwell! Ashwin comes round the wicket, Maxwell gets cheeky and looks to play the reverse sweep, he gets in position but the execution was all haywire, exposed all three stumps and it was the carrom ball that shaved the leg stu,p, he was on the floor after losing balance The captains interviews will follow. With all due credit to Ashwin, was expecting Yuvraj to be the Man of the Match. Player of the match is Ravichandran Ashwin, INDIA","India 159 for 7 (Yuvraj 60) beat Australia 86 (Ashwin 4-11, Mishra 2-13) by 73 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details We've been expecting you, Mr Singh. Many an India fan wanted Yuvraj Singh out because he had been plodding and prodding around this tournament even though he took most wickets and scored most runs for India between the two World Twenty20s. India, though, persisted with him, even giving him an extra chance at the expense of Shikhar Dhawan who made way for Ajinkya Rahane who simply had to be tried. Yuvraj struggled here again, reaching 13 off 21 before he exploded to end up with 60 off 43, showing just why MS Dhoni has shown so much faith in him. That innings provided a middling innings the acceleration it needed, after which R Ashwin's wily spin triggered an almighty collapse from Australia, who were already out of the tournament and weren't quite there in the chase."
"Santokie to Warner, 1 bye 112 kph, that's his fastest ball of the over. Full and just outside off, Warner was targeting a thump through the covers but doesn't connect. Deflection off the keeper for byes Samuels to Finch, OUT slog sweep across the line fetches the first wicket. Samuels persists with flighting it and invites Finch to go for the heave over the leg side. Misses completely and has his off stump pegged back Samuels to Watson, 1 wide fires it full and down the leg side Badree to Warner, OUT this is the skidder and Warner's bat speed is just not quick enough! Might have stayed a touch low too as Badree targets middle. The batsman was making room to cut, but fails. Has a satisfied little smile as he jogs over to his fielders to celebrate Narine to Watson, OUT he's missed the stumps on the first attempt, but he's broken it on the second and Watson's back foot had not moved back into safety! That's a major brain fade! Narine tosses the one that spins the other way and Watson gropes for it. His back foot was bang on the line and he seemed completely unaware of it. To the point of giving Ramdin a second bite at the cherry Badree to Bailey, SIX runs there's Australia's counterpunch! Bailey gets down on one knee and wallops this clear over the midwicket boundary Samuels to Bailey, OUT skips down the track and he's picked out the man at short midwicket! Samuels had seen the batsman advancing and adjusted his length, but it was still not too threatening. But Bailey has shoveled it straight into the hands of his opposite number Samuels to Maxwell, SIX runs slog swept way into the stands behind midwicket. Took it from off stump and a full-blooded swing has massacred this Narine to Hodge, OUT oh dear! He's gone for a premeditated reverse sweep and has lost his leg stump! Narine, as he often does, claims a crucial wicket in the death. This was too full for the shot but he goes through with it. The ball sneaks between his legs and lights up those LEDs Santokie to Faulkner, OUT he seemed to had fluffed it, but he threw himself back and completes the catch with a whole lot of flair! This was full with a bit of width attached to it and Faulkner looked for the inside out smash over cover. His slower pace doesn't allow for much timing on it and this goes up high than long. Bravo had raced up from long-off and had almost overran it. The ball pops out of his reverse cup, but he had his eyes on the ball all the way and just propels himself off his feet in a Bollinger to Smith, 1 leg bye another short ball, this one getting considerable bounce. Whacks him on the helmet as he goes for another pull and skies towards third man Starc to Bravo, SIX runs oh dear, he's offered up length and Bravo's tucked into it. Went back and pulled it into the stands behind deep square leg 7.05 pm As expected, it was a power-packed performance and West Indies had outgunned the pre-tournament favourites by so much that Australia's chances of qualifying to the semi-finals have taken a huge hit. There's another game coming up to keep the cricket high going, so do tune in to India v Bangladesh. Thank you for your company and comments, this is Alagappan Muthu saying Goodnight and Good Luck... West Indies won by 6 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Daren Sammy, WI","West Indies 179 for 4 (Gayle 53) beat Australia 178 for 8 (Maxwell 45, Narine 2-19) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details West Indian batting power ejected Australia from the previous World T20 in Sri Lanka and has all but done so again after Darren Sammy pulled off a remarkable heist in Mirpur. Chris Gayle gave West Indies a blazing start to their chase of 179 but they spluttered in the middle and Australia were firm favourites when George Bailey handed the ball to Mitchell Starc with 31 still needed from the final two overs. Sammy had other ideas. A half-volley was smashed over long-on for six, a flick was finessed to the fine-leg boundary and another four was slashed behind point, and Starc's inability to land the ball in the right spots meant 19 runs had leaked from his over, leaving 12 required off the final six balls. Importantly, Sammy was on strike, though his partner Dwayne Bravo had contributed plenty to the chase with 27 off 12 deliveries."
"2.40 pm Our very own Shiva Jayaraman shoots out just about the perfect stat with the toss around the corner. Mirpur has hosted six T20s and in all of them the team that has won the toss has gone on to win the game. Tuck into the preview by Brydon Coverdale and the musings from both camps. Bollinger to Shehzad, OUT goes for the pull with one that is not at all short enough. Top edge lands into Bollinger's waiting hands and Pakistan lose an early wicket. He was cramped as well, with the line being on middle and off. Pakistan wanted to be a lot more aggressive in this game, but that time it went against them Starc to Kamran, 1 wide this time the inswinger takes the fuller ball down the leg side Coulter-Nile to Kamran, 1 leg bye back of a length and tucks him up on leg stump, Kamran looks to whip it away but he doesn't succeed as well as he would like Hogg to Kamran, 1 leg bye flighted on leg stump and this strikes him on the front pad as he looks to nudge. Big appeal from Hogg, but it had pitched outside Finch to Umar Akmal, SIX runs drags his length down and Umar has rocked back and tonked it over midwicket. Every single bad ball Australia have bowled, he's made them pay Finch to Umar Akmal, SIX runs this goes miles! Reaches his fifty off 28 deliveries and this one was a gift. Pitched halfway down and it was pulverised into the stands Coulter-Nile to Maqsood, OUT he was never comfortable out there and a yorker on middle eases his misery. Goes for a leg-side slog and has his furniture rearranged Watson to Afridi, SIX runs this is in his arc and Afridi has murdered it. Gets on the front foot and he's slammed it well into the stands behind midwicket. Bowling a length ball in a situation like this... Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT is that it? No, he hasn't got hold of the full toss outside off. Swings as best he could but this goes more off the bottom of the bat and sits in the hands of long-on. Gets a pat on the back from his partner and he walks off, dribbling a whole load of sweat behind him 5.10 pm While I collect my thoughts after that magnificent innings from Umar Akmal, why don't you all enjoy the musings of Martin Crowe and Daryll Cullinan on Match Point. Pakistan were not in the best position when he strode out at No. 4 but he was remarkably efficient against some rather ordinary bowling from Australia. That midwicket boundary was never left alone as he along with his brother Afridi to Finch, SIX runs flat and length on middle, Finch follows his partner's example and sweeps him over the square leg boundary. Concern on the face of Kamran behind the stumps Afridi to Maxwell, SIX runs another 15-run over! Just drifting on the pads and Maxi has been brutal with that sweep shot. Absolutely no intention to keep it down. Australia have smashed 39 runs in the last three Bhatti to Maxwell, SIX runs that's his fifty!. Fourth-fastest overall in T20 cricket. Length again just outside off and Maxi's swung this over long-on Bhatti to Maxwell, (no ball) beamer! And it continues on it's merry way to the fine leg boundary. Searching for the yorker but it was well over waist high. Maxwell ducks and sways and gets out of the way. Afridi to Maxwell, OUT slog off the front foot again, but this time he's picked out deep midwicket! He picked it off a length and it looked good for another six, but the man steadied himself on the boundary and clings on. End of a match-changing innings from Maxwell and Pakistan will breathe a giant sigh of relief. Star man does the trick Umar Gul to Hodge, OUT Ajmal, you beauty! This was hit like a rocket and he flings both hands up over his head at deep point and snares a very good catch! Pakistan are definitely pulling things back here. Full and outside off, Hodge had cleared his frong leg and had nailed this, but could not place it well enough. Ajmal wears a giant smile 7.00 pm Hugs all around for Pakistan. They had the game for the first 20 overs, lost it in the middle when Glenn Maxwell was going beserk, but their bowlers would not give up. Saeed Ajmal laid his St Lucia demons to rest with a wicket and a terrific catch on the boundary and helped Pakistan over the line. Umar Gul and Shahid Afridi produced telling overs in the death and ensured Umar Akmal's be 7.05 pm Not too long for you guys to catch your breaths because the second game is coming at you in a few minutes. Thank you for your company here, This is Alagappan Muthu, wishing long live T20. Player of the match is Umar Akmal, PAK","Pakistan 191 for 5 (Umar Akmal 94) beat Australia 175 (Maxwell 74, Finch 65) by 16 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 4:56 Crowe: Australia don't have the spin game for this tournament If ever proof was needed that Pakistan are world cricket's most mercurial side, take this match as exhibit A. Bilawal Bhatti's first over cost 30 runs, Pakistan dropped two catches in three balls, they conceded an 18-ball half-century to Glenn Maxwell and in their own innings stumbled to 25 for 2 in their fifth over. Oh, and they won. Comfortably, in the end. So relaxed was Mohammad Hafeez by the end that he trusted Bhatti with the final over, with Australia needing 23."
"5.30 pm Australia have won the toss and elect to bowl. Few changes for both sides as Cameron White comes in for David Warner and AB de Villiers is back for Farhan Behardien. The leggie Imran Tahir also gets a go. Moises Henriques also gets a look-in before the World T20 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, 1 wide 139 kph, looks like De Kock is all fine but Australia continue the short-ball barrage. This one is too far down leg though. Lets it go and takes a wide Coulter-Nile to de Kock, SIX runs this one's even better! Coulter-Nile strays a bit too full and that's where he's strong. Whipped away over the midwicket boundary. That's as clean as any you would see Starc to Amla, OUT plumb in front, a Starc inswinger does Mighty Hash in! This was a terrific ball, kept nice and full and it swung in rather sharply too. Amla was stuck in his crease and was swiping across the line. Very unlike him, but he's been troubled by the ones that are full and at his stumps lately Maxwell to du Plessis, OUT oops, he's chipped that straight to mid-off and Maxi sends him off with a stare. This happed in slow-motion. Faf moved outside leg again, the bowler followed up with a full one. He lifted it and I guess he wanted to beat the fielder, but the fielder backpedaled and chipped it straight to him Hogg to Duminy, 1 leg bye that was the wrong 'un there. JP seems to have picked it as he shuffles across and tries to nudge towards short fine leg. Strikes on the thigh. Too high for that appeal Maxwell to Duminy, OUT he's picked out the man at deep cover! That was smoked, I tell you. Ah, actually he had to reach out and it went off the open face. Tossed up on leg stump and he made some room to loft it over the infield and he would have hoped for it to go over the ropes too, but has to watch has Henriques comes up and pouches an easy catch Hogg to de Villiers, OUT they're all finding the fielders on the boundary! Neat catch by Hodge at deep sqauare leg. This was short and asking to be hit. AB obliged with a pull but he has struck it hard and flat. Hodge comes forward and picks it as it was dying on him Maxwell to de Kock, 1 wide fuller and flatter delivery bowled down the leg side. Will have to bowl that again Henriques to Miller, OUT the ball is definitely holding up! This one goes straight to short cover. Length ball angled across him and Miller seeks a drive on the up. Bad shot considering the pitch and he perishes Hogg to de Kock, OUT that is a corker! de Kock can just tuck his bat in under his shoulder and walk back. Tossed up on middle and leg but once this hits the pitch it turns viciously. He was playing with a closed bat looking for midwicket. Only manages an outside edge through to the keeper's gloves. Terrific take from Haddin as well. There's another golden oldies combo Watson to Morkel, SIX runs that's why he's in the side! Belted over cow corner! Length ball, just the perfect welcome back present for Albie and he clears that front leg and swings those big shoulders. Starc to Morkel, SIX runs 135kph, whacked over midwicket! He made room outside leg and the bowler followed him with a short ball and it was climbing towards his head too. Albie's not too worried as he pounds this in front of square Starc to Morkel, OUT 139kph, take that! Yorker seeking to topple middle and Albie can't dig this out. Again favours making room, but this one isn't the kind of ball he can swing away to cow corner. Tries to kep it out but he's too slow Starc to Hendricks, 1 wide 140kph, full ball slides down the leg side. Coulter-Nile to Hendricks, 1 leg bye yorker on leg stump, Hendricks is struck on the boot outside leg so no point to that appeal. Sneak a single as the ball squirts off to square leg Coulter-Nile to Hendricks, SIX runs charges down the track and takes on this length ball. He'd ensured he had room enough to smite this over midwicket. A full swing of the arms gives him all the leverage he needs Parnell to Maxwell, 1 wide 141kph, loud appeal for caught behind, but the ump's spreading his arms for the wide. This was short and down leg. Goes for the hook this time and doesn't connect Morkel to Watson, SIX runs this is even better! Straight down the ground. Australia rollicking along! That showcases the power of the man, fullish on off stump and Watson plants his front foot down the pitch and smashes it straight over the bowler's head ""The last seven-over game wasn't ideal preparation,"" says Shane Watson. Today was a good job for us, Amazing job to get the ground and the pitch in such a great state. The pitch played really well. I think it was a little slow early because it was under the covers, but when we out there it was sliding out nicely. We got the better conditions. That's also the team set up as well. With the firepower we have down to 10, Hoggy can 8.50pm George Bailey and Imran Tahir have a little convo as the teams head out towards the pavilion. Australia tuck another win under their shoulders and an impressive one at that. Good with the ball, highly efficient with the bat. Add David Warner into this mix and this top-order can outgun any in the game. Just about the perfect momentum into a World Cup, but at the other end South Africa bowlers will need to remedy their len 9.05 pm So that's about all we have for you from here. Do stay on to read up on the report and the plays for this game. This is Alagappan Muthu, wishing you safe travels Australia won by 6 wickets (with 30 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Starc, AUS","Australia 129 for 4 (Finch 39, Tahir 2-21) beat South Africa 128 for 7 (De Kock 41, Starc 2-16) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia's bowlers set up the win with Mitchell Starc leading the way AFP Australia ended their South African tour as they started it: with an emphatic win in Centurion. They overwhelmed the hosts in the longest and shortest format at the venue to claim both trophies on offer in their month-long visit and winning the T20 series by a 2-0 margin. In conditions that offered swing and seam movement, Australia's bowlers restricted South Africa to a below-par total. Their batsmen, sans David Warner who was rested for the final game, chased it down like a team in a hurry and they are - to get to the World T20 in Bangladesh. Australia will go there far more prepared than South Africa after a clinical performance that exposed South Africa's vulnerabilities, especially without their two pace spearheads."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bowl first. Bailey said he wasn't sure what's a good enough score. It's only seven overs. Faf says he was happy to lose the toss because he was indecisive. He added that they were concerned about injuries ahead of a big tournament. Beuran Hendricks is playing today. Starc to Amla, 1 wide he sprayed that really wide outside the off stump Coulter-Nile to Amla, OUT well Amla's misery ends! After failing to connect the previous two balls he hits this one back to the bowler, Coulter-Nile shows good reflexes to hang on to it in his follow through Starc to de Kock, 1 bye this was fired in quick, the yorker a bit too good for de Kock, he fails to dig it out Hendricks to Hodge, 1 wide and he sprays it too wide this time, Hodge tries to dig it out outside off but misses Parnell to Haddin, 1 leg bye well bowled! This was fired full and Haddin shuffled across the stumps and looked to force it to the on side, the ball clipped the pad and rolled away That leaves the series at 1-0 going into Centurion on Friday. The forecast there isn't great either so South Africa will hope the weather clears up so they can have a shot at squaring this. Thanks for your company tonight. Could have been frustrating with the delay but thanks for staying on. We'll see you soon! Australia won by 5 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Brad Hodge, AUS","Australia 81 for 5 (Warner 40, Hodge 21*, Duminy 2-5) beat South Africa 80 for 1 (De Kock 41*, du Plessis 27*) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details David Warner's 40 helped Australia to victory Getty Images Brad Hodge clubbed the third and fourth deliveries of the last over over deep midwicket to haul Australia home in a seven-over shootout against South Africa in Durban. Steady rain had threatened successive washouts in the series but relented to allow a sizeable crowd some action. Australia needed 15 going into the final over and Wayne Parnell conceded only a run each off the first two deliveries, but Hodge was to seal it with two balls to spare, the couple of sixes followed by one called wide for height. David Warner was South Africa's tormentor again at the start of the chase, as he and Aaron Finch took 21 off Lonwabo Tsotsobe's first over. Warner then hit debutant Beuran Hendricks for three successive boundaries in the third over as Australia surged to 44 for 1 in three overs."
"3.00 pm Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat They have made three changes: Sohag Gazi, Mominul Haque and Taskin Ahmed, the 18-year old seamer makes his debut. Australia have brought in Dan Christian and Nathan Coulter-Nile. The Australia captain said they have not played a complete game so far. There need be noth Coulter-Nile to Tamim, 1 wide poor direction from Coulter-Nile and he's saved a few blushes by a big dive from the keeper. Inswinger goes way down leg Coulter-Nile to Tamim, 1 wide slower ball, slides down leg again. Two wides in his first over back in the side. Coulter-Nile to Anamul, OUT simple catch at first slip and Anamul succumbs to a very rash shot! Charged him and swung wildly, that's been his gameplan in this little innings, and it ends with a straightforward snick into the cordon. Reward for a fuller length for Coulter-Nile Coulter-Nile to Tamim, OUT good length ball around the off stump, Tamim goes for an on-the-up drive again but this time his timing is terrible. Lobs a low catch to mid-off and departs with his head down. He's not had a very good few months recently and that rut continues Maxwell to Mushfiqur, SIX runs this sails into the Mirpur crowd! That's how you use you feet, got under the flighted ball and smacks it for an 84m-six over deep midwicket Maxwell to Shakib, SIX runs thumped straight down the ground! Shakib is motoring along. Gets under this quick dart on middle and heaves it towards the sight screen Starc to Mushfiqur, 1 wide this time the yorker goes wrong. Ends up a wide full toss outside off, nowhere near Mushi's reach Watson to Mushfiqur, OUT went deep in his crease to try and get under this fuller ball on middle, but the slog falls safely into the hands of Maxwell at deep midwicket. Falls short of a well-deserved fifty Watson to Shakib, 1 wide fuller delivery pushed way too far across the left-hander, even if he was moving across to off stump Starc to Nasir, OUT bowled off the last ball as he was trying to make room! Beaten for pace as he tried to dab it away to third man for at best a single Razzak to Warner, SIX runs too straight and Warner slog sweeps him miles past the square leg boundary. Picked it early, got under it and struck it powerfully Al-Amin to Warner, OUT off goes the middle stump and Al-Amin sends Warner off, with a few verbals as well. Good length ball angled in at the stumps as he had switched around the wicket. The batsman went for a pull, when it wasn't really short enough and misses. Middle stump is knocked back and Al-Amin gets in W Taskin to Finch, 1 wide fuller delivery slides down leg, and the umpire calls him on it Mominul to Finch, SIX runs look out over extra cover! Plantede his front leg outside leg and hammered this over the top, that's the second time he's nailed that shot today Al-Amin to Finch, OUT terrific catch from Nasir, who inspects his right wrist to check for damage. Leg cutter dupes him as Finch backs away and looks to flay this over the covers. Gets more of an edge which soars into the evening sky. Deep point races in, keeps his eyes on the ball all the way through and pouch Taskin to Maxwell, OUT misses a full toss and has his stumps in disarray. First T20 wicket for Taskin. Looked to hit across the line towards midwicket and the bat face closed a little too early. Consolation wicket, but Australia are already on the cusp of a... uh, consolation victory 6.45 pm That's it from this match, thank you for your company and your comments but do go on to the other match, where Pakistan and West Indies will fight for a spot in the semi-final. This is Alagappan Muthu, signing off Australia won by 7 wickets (with 15 balls remaining) Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 158 for 3 (Finch 71, Warner 48) beat Bangladesh 153 for 5 (Shakib 66, Mushfiqur 47) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Al-Amin Hossain fined Bangladesh fast bowler Al-Amin Hossain was fined 15% of his match fee, for giving David Warner a send-off after dismissing him. He was found to be in breach of article 2.1.4 of the ICC code of conduct, which relates to ""using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting during an international match"". If the destructive power brought to bear by Aaron Finch and David Warner allowed Australia to evade the ignominy of their worst-ever global tournament display, then it also underlined why the sometime favourites will fly home with an especially bitter memory of the 2014 World Twenty20."
"Kuldeep to Smith, 1 leg bye fuller, down the pads, and he looks to flick this away. Off the pads, towards fine leg Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT what a grab this time! Jadeja has tossed this up a touch, and Labuschagne plays another whippy inside out drive. Cannot keep it down, and Kohli dives low to his right and plucks this inches off the grass. Makes it look effortless, but that was a fabulous effort! Big wicket, but it might not be the worst thing for Australia Jadeja to Starc, OUT two wickets in the over, but a not-so-huge loss for Australia! Jadeja pulls the length back a touch, and also slows it down. Starc looks to slog across the line, but gets it quite high on the bad, and substitute Chahal down by the deep mid-wicket fence has to move across to his left to accept this gleefully! Bumrah to Smith, 1 leg bye length, he shuffles across to the off side and gets struck on the pads in trying to flick. Bumrah wanted to appeal this vociferously, but the line and height might have gone against him Saini to Carey, 1 leg bye length, jags back in and beats the inside edge as he looks to flick. Off the pads towards third man Kuldeep to Carey, OUT played with the turn, and the wicket finally comes!. Lofted it over cover, and looked a pretty good shot, in all fairness. But because he was reaching for it outside off stump, he never could get the purchase he needed to clear the ropes. Big wicket for Kuldeep in his final over Saini to Turner, OUT marvellous delivery to finish. Yorker just outside off stump, goes underneath the bat. India re stifling Australia here. And what's this? India have reviewed for a caught behind! The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli Shami to Cummins, OUT and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball. Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye into the pads, and Agar comes through for a leg bye. Can Bumrah clean up this innings here and now? Shami to Zampa, OUT cleans up Zampa! Shami just keeps picking up wickets. Inswinging full ball, Zampa tries to go big, it comes off his pad and smashes into leg stump Shami to Hazlewood, 1 leg bye backs away and Shami follows him. gets a leg bye and gets the strike back to Agar Shami to Finch, SIX runs absolutely remarkable shot. Pitched up, and Finch leaps on to it in a flash and essentially just drives it over mid-off, all the way for six. Brilliant stroke. Shami to Finch, 1 leg bye angled down leg side, flicked off the pad Shami to Smith, OUT a mix-up and Australia pay for it with a wicket. Finch gone! What on earth happened there? Smith angled it to short third man, and Finch hared off for one. Smith was always hesitant, and soon enough Finch was at Smith's end. Tried to race back, but the ball was lobbed to Shami, who comfortably removes the bails Kuldeep to Smith, 1 wide down the leg side, they appeal for a caught-behind, but the umpire doesn't fall for it. Wide given, as the batsman misses out on a sweep Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT what a grab this time! Jadeja has tossed this up a touch, and Labuschagne plays another whippy inside out drive. Cannot keep it down, and Kohli dives low to his right and plucks this inches off the grass. Makes it look effortless, but that was a fabulous effort!

India have reviewed for a caught behind! The UltraEdge shows a spike when the ball touches the bat. He's gone! Smart review by Kohli Saini to Smith, SIX runs what an absolutely nonsensical shot that is. Absolutely ridiculous. Just outside off, and SMith moves across, and simply wrists it in the air over deep square leg. Sails away for six. That was all wrist. Bumrah to Agar, 1 leg bye gets away with that. Dragged down leg, and Agar can only get his pad to it and come through for another leg bye Shami to Cummins, OUT and he's accounted for Cummins first ball again. Just the same way as in Rajkot. The yorker is simply too good for Cummins to get any bat on. It goes underneath and castles him first ball. Shami to Zampa, OUT cleans up Zampa! Shami just keeps picking up wickets.

Maximum! Zampa to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs short, and he has taken full toll of this. May have slipped out of Zampa's grasp as he looked for the flipper, but it sat up nicely. Rohit deposits this deep over mid-wicket Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT he's gone through him! Full ball, and Kohli shuffles across and tries a swipe towards mid-wicket. Misses out on contact, and the ball just kisses the pads and then smashes into the stumps. Chinnaswamy rises as one to applaud this innings.

Goes down leg side, and it has been called a wide. Australia choose to review this, but they are told they don't have enough time for this. Seemed to sound like thigh pad, or perhaps even the bat. Looks like thigh pad Starc to Iyer, SIX runs short, angles across him, and Iyer swats this over deep mid-wicket. Big six!

You can follow live updates right here. This is Debayan Sen, saying goodbye on behalf of Thilak Gowda, Danyal Rasool and the rest of our gang at ESPNcricinfo. India won by 7 wickets (with 15 balls remaining) Player of the match is Rohit Sharma, INDIA","Bangladesh 122 for 8 (Naim 23, Ellis 2-16, Christian 2-17) beat Australia 62 (Wade 22, Shakib 4-9, Saifuddin 3-12) by 60 runs It was a nightmarish end to a tough tour for Australia. As if losing the series wasn't enough, in the final T20I, they lost 8 for 24 to collapse to 62 all out in a chase of 123. This was their lowest total across limited-overs cricket. It meant Bangladesh took the series 4-1 in Dhaka. Shakib Al Hasan, who nabbed his 100th T20I wicket on the way, led with a haul of 4 for 9, with Mohammad Saifuddin grabbing 3 for 12 as Bangladesh choked Australia, not for the first time, with spin."
"Utseya to Hughes, OUT he's been done by the spin and the sweep doesn't work this time! It was flighted on length just outside off, Hughes swept against the turn and an edge flew back towards slip where Nyumbu took it towards his right. He looked uneasy against the spinners right from the start Williams to Bailey, OUT and another, and what a beauty from Williams this time! Bailey stood outside the leg stump and exposed the stumps for the delivery that drifted in with the angle but spun enough to beat the outside edge as Bailey played inside the line off the backfoot. The Zimbabwe spinners are putting their team on top as Bailey looked back in disbelief seeing that ball turn Waller to Maxwell, OUT knocked him this time, Maxwell also gone! Maxwell also plays inside the line for this ball that pitched outside off and came in, but it didn't come in that much and enough to hit the top of off stump as he looked to push it down the ground by closing the face of the bat Utseya to Marsh, 1 wide roaring turn there, pitched around off stump and then veered well past Marsh's flick. Umpire Dar says that's too much Tiripano to Marsh, OUT not the pitch to be driving throuh the line and Marsh learns it the hard way. He'd refrained from doing that against the spinners but couldn't replicate that with a little more pace on the ball. It was the cross-seamer, pitched full and a shade outside off, stopped on the pitch just enough to skew his timing and short cover makes a smart grab Williams to Haddin, SIX runs pitches it up and Haddin counterattacks! Went down on a knee and launched this one from leg stump to the cow corner boundary for a clean six! Tiripano to Haddin, OUT he holes out this time! It was pitched up again around leg stump and he lofted it down to long-on for an easy catch. But he did his job for that crucial knock of 49 Starc to Raza, 1 wide further down the leg side and this one's a wide Faulkner to Raza, 1 wide it's that back of the hand slower ball from Faulkner, but it's down leg for a wide Faulkner to Mawoyo, 1 wide down the leg side for another wide - that was a bouncer and Faulkner thought there was bat on that Cutting to Mawoyo, 1 wide short ball going down leg, Mawoyo chases with a hook but it's a wide Maxwell to Masakadza, 5 wide this hits the footmarks on leg stump and turns away further quite sharply. Masakadza simply watches it and his team enjoys five wides Starc to Tiripano, 1 leg bye drifts on to the pads and Tiripano gets cheered for bringing Chiggy back on strike with a flick to fine leg. That cheer could have been for Zim reaching 150 Starc to Chigumbura, 1 wide this is angled too far away from the batsman. Aleem Dar gets some stretching excercise Starc to Utseya, 1 wide appeal for caught behind as Haddin takes this down the leg side, there was some noise as the ball went past the batsman.. Dar calls it a wide.. but it looks like it might have flicked something on the way Superb win for Zimbabwe but the test gets tougher. People will expect more from them. Next game is South Africa v Australia and we will be back for that. Thanks for your comments and feedback. On behalf of Vishal Fixit, Galappan Muthu, this is Fevashish Duloria signing off. Ciao ciao. Zimbabwe won by 3 wickets (with 12 balls remaining) Player of the match is Elton Chigumbura, ZIM","Zimbabwe 211 for 7 (Chigumbura 52*, Lyon 4-44) beat Australia 209 for 9 (Clarke 68*) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:51 Moonda: A piece of history for Zimbabwe In the 30th ODI meeting between these sides, Zimbabwe did what they had not for 31 years and beat Australia. The captain Elton Chigumbura engineered the chase that changed 11,406 days of history, after his spinners had applied a stranglehold that kept Australia to their lowest total against Zimbabwe, and achieved only their second win against these opponents. Chigumbura's opposite number, Michael Clarke, battled a hamstring niggle that ruled him out of the rest of the tri-series, and held his side together on a spin-friendly surface on which none of the other Australian batsmen settled. But Zimbabwe's challenge was always going to be chasing a total over 200 - they were dismissed for less in their last four ODIs - and when Nathan Lyon picked up career-best figures and they were reduced to 156 for 7, another collapse seemed likely. A 55-run stand between Chigumbura and Prosper Utseya for the eighth wicket ensured Zimbabwe did not fold and sent Harare Sports Club into frenzied celebration."
"Morkel to Bailey, OUT what did he do there? Bailey was opened up by this back of a length ball that straightened just outside off, and it may have bounced more than expected, and, oh my, the ball's missed his outside edge completely and hit his trouser pocket on its way through to the keeper. The umpire's finger went up immediately McLaren to Smith, 1 wide gives himself room again and McLaren follows him with the bouncer, but it bounces way over the head and well down the leg side, and the umpire has to give that wide Morkel to Maxwell, 1 wide short, down the leg side, and de Kock lets out a wistful caught behind appeal. Maxwell looked to pull and got nowhere near the ball Morkel to Haddin, 1 leg bye short ball, angling down the leg side again, he gets a bit of hip on that and it dies just short of de Kock scrambling to his left 1.20pm South Africa bowled well in patches, but those patches came between spells of Australian dominance. Hughes and Finch built a very good platform, and Finch and Bailey ensured Australia didn't lose too much steam even as they lost a couple of wickets to the spinners in the middle. South Africa dismissed Maxwell cheaply, but Smith and Johnson powered Australia to a pretty formidable total in the end. South Africa will have to do very well to chase this. Johnson to Duminy, 1 wide looks for the yorker, and slants this down the leg side Faulkner to Duminy, 1 wide now he bowls this down the leg side, and Duminy, shuffling across, can't quite get his bat on that flick 5.50pm So that's all from me, George and Chandan for today. It was an awesome game of cricket, and a pleasure to commentate on. Thanks for tuning in, as always, and sending in your comments. Do join us for our next live game, wherever in the world it's from. Until next time, bye! South Africa won by 7 wickets (with 20 balls remaining) Player of the match is AB de Villiers, SA","South Africa 328 for 3 (de Villiers 136*, du Plessis 106) beat Australia 327 for 7 (Finch 102, Bailey 66, Hughes 51) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:02 'De Villiers and du Plessis knew how to pace their innings' South Africa needed 91 runs from 77 balls when AB de Villiers, with 91 to his name and cramp slicing through his hamstring, walked across his crease, got down on one knee and scooped James Faulkner over his left-shoulder onto the open stands for six. In that one shot, all the questions about South Africa's ability to take on the best were answered. De Villiers saw his childhood friend Faf du Plessis record his first ODI century in his 51st game, scored a hundred of his own and was there to scamper the winning single when JP Duminy called for it with 21 balls remaining. The seven-wicket win in a 300-plus chase was as comprehensive as South Africa could have wanted after Australia controlled most of first half. Aaron Finch's fourth ODI century saw them through the middle-over squeeze and set up for a strong finish."
"Australia have taken 147 off the last ten overs. Maxwell and Marsh's partnership was worth 109 in nine overs. Marsh making it count after a nervy start at No 3, Finch looking solid before he picked the fielder, Haddin unfortunate to fall short of his fifty, Bailey missing out, but the standout was Glenn Maxwell, with 93 off 46. This is Faulkner comes over the wicket now Starc to Nyumbu, 1 wide down the leg side with the angle for a wide Time for the presentation: Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 350 for 6 (Maxwell 93, Marsh 89) beat Zimbabwe 152 (Masakadza 70, Smith 3-16) by 198 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:50 Firdose Moonda: Australia showed no rust A blistering 109-run stand in nine overs between Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell saw Australia rack up the highest ODI total at the Harare Sports Club and leave Zimbabwe in the dust in the tri-series opener. Both Marsh, promoted to No.3 in Michael Clarke's injury-enforced absence, and Maxwell recorded their highest scores in the format as Australia stacked on 147 runs in their last ten overs. Zimbabwe's best batsman, Hamilton Masakadza, managed less than half of that. On a late winter surface, neither team's bowlers were able to extract much from the pitch but Zimbabwe's attack was rendered particularly toothless in the face of Australia's aggression."
"Morkel to Finch, 1 leg bye drifts on to the pads and Finch misses out a flick, it grazes the pads and rolls to the leg side Steyn to Hughes, OUT first wicket! This has been smashed to short cover. Steyn pitched it up outside off and Hughes made such good connection the reverberation of that shot would have been felt in Melbourne.. but he punches it straight into the hands of the fielder.. A stinger made look easy Phangiso to Finch, FOUR runs he is finally able to get it through! Handsome inside-out drive over the infield. He was trying to score six boundaries in this over.. but he gets the first one off the sixth ball Parnell to Finch, 5 wide this is a good over.. surprises the batsman with a sharp bouncer but it sails over the batsman and the keeper Parnell to Finch, 1 leg bye another appeal, this one is for lbw.. But this one pitched outside leg and was probably going over.. The batsmen take a leg bye to the off side Tahir to Bailey, OUT that's the googly again! Tahir buzz lightyears to infinity and beyond in celebration.. Last over, Bailey didn't pick one. He doesn't pick this one either but chops this on to his stumps Steyn to Marsh, 1 leg bye he misses out on a flick on this leg side-ish delivery, picks up a leg bye to square leg Steyn to Finch, OUT Finch goes extinct! The theory of evolution would tell you that Finch was a bit uncomfortable in the environment and was not going to last long. (Maybe there will be new improved version soon). This one jags back in from Steyn and takes out the middle as the batsman pushes limply outside the Steyn to Maxwell, OUT this is gone! Maxwell can't solve this equation.. Steyn has been reversing it in in the second spell and this time he traps him on the back foot.. Maxwell was stuck in the crease and plays outside the line.. The umpire raises the finger Tahir to Marsh, SIX runs he has had enough! He takes a tiny step down the pitch and hammers the flighted delivery over the sight screen...out of the ground.. He has cleared the four-storey building there Parnell to Marsh, OUT now Marsh is sent packing! This one is on a length - pretty straight forward delivery - and Marsh pushes at it a bit tentatively.. It gets a thick inside edge and knocks the middle stump back Steyn to Haddin, OUT you can't keep him away! This one is fired in to the stumps and Haddin gets smacked on the back pad.. that was hitting middle and leg. Not massive reverse, but it just tails in enough to get a wicket.. At his pace, it's always a tricky delivery to play Morkel to Johnson, OUT superb catch at the boundary from Phangiso! To be fair to Johnson, he got a good amount of bat on that.. he flicked it off the middle stump and this would have been a six on some grounds.. but this is a long boundary.. Phangiso, at deep square leg, has to back-pedal and manages to hold on Steyn to Starc, 1 wide this one slides past the outside edge as the batsman looks to drive.. called a wide, a tad harshly Tahir to Starc, SIX runs long handle comes handy! Starc gets under this flighted delivery and smashes it over the cow corner Phangiso to Starc, 1 leg bye how has he survived that one! That spun in from outside off and hit the batsman who was stuck on the crease.. was it turning down leg? Maybe Morkel to Faulkner, 1 wide he sees the batsman charging and pushes it wide, a bit too wide.. Morkel to Faulkner, OUT he moves to the leg side to hit it over the top but Faulkner has holed out at long on Maxwell to de Kock, OUT he would have loved to found the gap this time, Quinton de Kock has fallen early once more, he skips over near the pitch of the ball and looks to clobber the ball over the leg side, a leading edge sends the ball looping towards Bailey at cover, Maxwell gets de Kock again Starc to du Plessis, 1 wide fires this down the leg side, he will have to re-bowl this one Marsh to Parnell, 1 wide now the bumper, it sails over the batsman's head Faulkner to de Villiers, SIX runs length ball is clobbered into the crowd, that was pure disdain, skates down the track and smashes that over midwicket Johnson to du Plessis, (no ball) is that a wide? is that a no-ball? the umpires confer after a high wide full toss outside, they decide it is a no-ball for height, don't think it should have been, scores level Johnson to du Plessis, OUT no century for Faf, he was losing his composure here as he needed a big shot to get his 100, he has lost his wicket now, a full toss is thrashed towards mid-on, hit high on the bat,else that was a four, end of a memorable series for Faf South Africa won by 6 wickets (with 55 balls remaining) Player of the match is Dale Steyn, SA","South Africa 221 for 4 (du Plessis 96, de Villiers 57*) beat Australia 217 for 9 (Faulkner 40, Steyn 4-35) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details South Africa won a first-ever tournament final against Australia after a Dale Steyn bowling masterclass handed them the advantage and an anchoring innings from Faf du Plessis - which ended just four short of what would have been a fourth century in the series - guided a composed chase. Steyn's four wickets, which included two in two balls, led a surge through the Australian middle-order in which South Africa plucked five wickets for 29 runs. South Africa paced the reply perfectly using du Plessis' purple patch as the pivot and winning with 9.1 overs remaining. On a pitch that had not been used in the tournament so far, Steyn found movement early on and reverse-swing by the half-way stage."
"Morkel to Smith, 1 leg bye banged in short, Smith goes for the pull, he doesn't connect and is hit on the shoulder Steyn to Hughes, 1 leg bye short of length ball on the pads, can't get bat on it, the ball rolls towards square leg for a leg-bye Tahir to Smith, OUT Smith's innings is over, Tahir gets the breakthrough, Smith skips down the crease and looks to power the ball through the off side, and gets a thick outside edge, de Kock hangs on to that one, just about, it came off de Kock's right thigh pad initially, de Kock kept his cool to latch on Steyn to Maxwell, OUT the Powerplay has struck, as it usually does, Glenn Maxwell is gone, a short ball from Steyn, Maxwell goes for the pull, top edge and the ball goes high up, Steyn wants it, so does de Kock, who will take it? it is de Kock who gets it as Steyn stays away Tahir to Marsh, SIX runs he connects this time and goes all the away! Tahir pitched it fuller and Marsh took it on the full by coming down and launched it over long-on for six Duminy to Bailey, SIX runs comes down the track to charge and he gets the distance to loft it over long-n for six. He took it on the full and even tough there was a fielder in the deep Steyn to Marsh, SIX runs boom, another one! Steyn pitches it short to reply but Marsh swat-pulls it over long-on for one more six! He has some power McLaren to Marsh, SIX runs one more, it's gone all the way! You can't bowl full to him, it was offered there outside off and whether there's no fielder at long-off, but it goes all the way Phangiso to Bailey, OUT gone this time! He's been stumped, being beaten by the turn! Bailey charged down this time, despite hitting a four previous ball, going for a lofted drive for a ball on off stump but the ball turned away from him and QDK did the rest 1.07pm Mitchell Marsh: [Feeling] not too bad. I have to give myself a chance, I like to hang around a bit and have a go at the end. I'm happy to be contributing to the team as a youngster and keep going. Pitch is not turning as much. We'll look to start well with early wickets and hopefully we'll get a win today. 1.30pm The players have come out a bit early for the chase. Hashim Amla will face Mitchell Johnson Marsh to du Plessis, SIX runs and a repeat from Faf, this is another outstanding hit, takes a couple of steps down the track, gets near the pitch, lofts this over mid-off for six, again the exaggerated lift of the back foot, this isn't the most quickest of surfaces, which allows for this sort of shot Lyon to de Villiers, OUT swept once more, this time in the air, taken at backward square leg, perhaps AB wanted to hit that over the fielder there, but instead he hits it straight at his chest, easy for Bailey, a massive wicket this, South Africa in a hole now, with their three most prolific batsmen in recent series gone, this is a test for middle and lower-middle order Maxwell to Duminy, 1 leg bye loud appeal for lbw, but not given! JPD went back a long way for this one that pitched on middle and it didn't turn, was going with the angle, but when it hit JPD on the back foot, the leg stump was visible. A very lucky Duminy also got a leg bye Maxwell to Miller, 1 wide goes down the leg side with the angle for a wide Johnson to McLaren, 1 wide tries the yorker, it's too quick and goes down leg for a wide. Good take by Haddin Starc to du Plessis, SIX runs charges down the ground and that's a powerful and flat six! He came down and took the ball as a half-volley to smash it over the bowler's head for a flat six Lyon to du Plessis, SIX runs makes room and Faf plays those very well! He moved way outside leg stump early and cashed in on the full delivery, it was full too, and executed a stunning inside-out lofted drive over long-off for six. Moves to 97 now Starc to du Plessis, SIX runs and another! He's doing a Mitchell Marsh here! Fuller from Starc and he tonked this one over the long-on boundary. He either connects them for six, or misses them. Nothing in between Johnson to du Plessis, 1 wide slow and wide outside off, left by the batsman for a side even though Faf tried to chase it Kane Richardson to du Plessis, OUT oh, he's hitwicket, what a way for that innings to end! Faf went back in the crease to turn the ball to deep midwicket from outside off and set off for a single too, but his right heel touched the base of the off stump and he has to walk back. He has a word with Phangiso before leaving the field Johnson to Morkel, 1 wide bangs it in short from wide of the crease and that's gone over Morkel's head for a wide 4.50pm A bonus-point win means Australia have made it to the series final, despite losing to Zimbabwe a couple of days ago. They were jittery today as well but Hughes and Marsh charged them to a very competitive score on this pitch. Their bowlers never allowed South Africa to get on top. No batsman could even score 25, barring du Plessis who ran out of partners before falling for 126. Most of the Presentation time: Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 282 for 7 (Marsh 86*, Hughes 85) beat South Africa 220 (Du Plessis 126, Marsh 2-23) by 62 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 2:21 'Australia get ideal dress-rehearsal for final' Mitchell Marsh almost single-handedly took Australia into the tri-series final, first by plundering 86 off 51 balls, including 21 off a single Dale Steyn over, and then with two wickets to dent South Africa's chase. The bonus-point victory has guaranteed Australia spot in Saturday's showdown but put South Africa's in some danger. If they lose to Zimbabwe by a massive margin, so much so that the hosts gain a bonus point and improve the net run-rate, South Africa could be on an early flight home. Marsh's blitz injected life into an Australian innings that was solid at the start but became stuck through the middle periods against a stranglehold of spin. He shared in a 71-run stand with Brad Haddin for the sixth wicket, which included taking 60 runs off five overs from the 44th over, as South Africa struggled for a death-bowling option."
"Afridi to Warner, OUT and Lala strikes! That was much slower than the previous ball, and it dropped on Warner, on off stump, and he pushed at it and lobbed the ball straight back to the bowler, at a nice, catchable waist height Irfan to Bailey, OUT got him! That was a length ball, angling away outside off, and Bailey followed it and sliced it straight to the man at backward point Tanvir to Hughes, OUT loud appeal and Tanvir gets him! Hughes has reviewed it. The ball swung in after pitching outside off, hit him on the knee roll in front of the off stump and that would have hit the stumps, says the ball-tracking technology. Hughes has to walk back Irfan to Smith, OUT full on off now, driven down to mid-on, and Haddin is a few feet outside the crease. The fielder - Anwar Ali - was alert to spot that and rocketed a flat throw for a direct hit. It's gone to the third umpire and Haddin is a few inches short. A dismissal made out of nothing, with full credit to the fielder Babar to Faulkner, 1 leg bye shorter towards the leg stump, Faulkner gets it to short fine leg off the pad Tanvir to Smith, OUT bowled again, this time he has to go! Smith charged down with some room and wanted to smash it over the covers but missed it and the ball knocked over the base of off stump Irfan to Faulkner, 1 wide low full toss is too wide outside off for a wide Irfan to Faulkner, OUT excellent work from Irfan. He first bowled a slower one on back of length by rolling his fingers over this one, Faulkner could not connect well and the ball went back towards the bowler. Starc was well outside the crease by now, Irfan is on the ground while stopping the ball and turns and gets a direct hit Tanvir to Faulkner, OUT gets a wicket first ball! Short of length ball was angled in, Faulkner pulled it but this ground is big and the blow was not that powerful, Umar Amin at deep midwicket takes a few steps in to catch it Starc to Sarfaraz, 1 wide looks to bowl the bouncer and loses his action a touch, sending this down the leg side Starc to Sarfaraz, 1 wide once again down the leg side, and Shehzad skips across his crease to earn his team a wide Faulkner to Shafiq, 1 leg bye back of a length, angling down the leg side, Shafiq tucks it away towards square leg Doherty to Fawad Alam, OUT that's another wicket, but the umpires are going up! Fawad swept it fine down the leg side, Smith was at first slip and he ran like a hare towards leg slip in anticipation just after the ball was delivered and takes what looks like an easy catch at leg slip. Great anticipation after he saw Fawad get into position to sweep. T Doherty to Shafiq, 1 wide drifts down the leg side for a wide past the pads Maxwell to Shafiq, 1 wide spins it well down leg for a wide Faulkner to Shafiq, OUT angled in from wide of the crease, Shafiq was stuck on the crease, and the break has given Australia a breakthrough! Shafiq checks with Amin whether he should review, and Amin says no, and you can see why he said that. It struck him below the knee-roll, on the crease, in front of middle stump. Starc to Umar Amin, 1 wide looks to get it a little fuller and straighter, and overdoes the straighter, slanting it down the leg side Faulkner to Anwar Ali, SIX runs length ball outside off, and Anwar hits it down the ground, over the bowler's head, with a straight bat and a full extension of the arms, and the ball sails over the long-on boundary 11.25pm And that's it from all of us. Hope you enjoyed following our ball-by-ball coverage. Until next time, it's good night from Vishal, me, and all the scorers. Before we go, here's one last comment: Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 231 for 9 (Smith 77, Warner 56, Tanvir 3-40, Afridi 2-44) beat Pakistan 230 (Shafiq 50, Richardson 2-36, Maxwell 2-41) by 1 run Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kane Richardson picked up the wickets of Sohaib Maqsood and Shahid Afridi Getty Images Australia rise to No. 1 in ODIs Australia have climbed to the top of the ICC ODI team rankings, after their 3-0 series win against Pakistan, while India have fallen to third place. The cancellation of the third ODI between India and West Indies in Visakhapatnam due to a cyclone means that India will not be able to regain the No.1 ranking at the end of the series, even if they win the last two ODIs. Australia have 114 points while India have 113 and victories in their next two matches will still leave India 0."
"Doherty to Shehzad, OUT he has pulled it straight to midwicket! It's a flatter one on a length, not really short enough and the batsman is not able to keep it down Johnson to Sarfaraz, OUT here goes another! Fuller and wider outside off, and all Sarfraz can do it slice it straight to point.. Another set batsman falls to a harmless delivery Lyon to Shafiq, 1 leg bye he takes his eyes off as he goes for the paddle, this is just over Haddin's shoulder.. A half-hearted appeal for lbw.. it's given a leg bye but it was off the bat Johnson to Umar Akmal, OUT he strikes first ball in the new spell, with a soft dismissal! It was a simple and full delivery on off and Akmal simply chipped it straight to mid-off to be pouched by Smith. Time to finish the grapes in the pavilion Johnson to Fawad Alam, 1 leg bye full delivery swinging in towards leg stump, Alam gets a leg bye to fine leg Kane Richardson to Shafiq, SIX runs crackalicious! It was full and in the zone for Shafiq, he stayed in his position and smacked it over the wide long-on boundary for a massive six Johnson to Afridi, 1 wide sways down the leg side with a short ball for a wide Johnson to Afridi, OUT wild swing, he connects with an edge and it's taken on second attempt at slip! It was another big swing outside off, Afridi got a thick edge and the ball was going over Smith's head. He leapt and got both hands to it, but it popped out and went to his left, Haddin wanted to get it too but Smith got it in the end with a dive Kane Richardson to Wahab Riaz, OUT missed it completely! It was a full delivery angled in towards middle and leg, Wahab looked to flick it with no timing and was bowled Lyon to Shafiq, OUT can't clear the field this time, gives an easy catch to mid-off! He charged down the track again to clear mid-off but gave an easy catch to Johnson at the edge of the circle Faulkner to Babar, OUT something has happened in the match, it's a wicket! From back of the hand again outside off, Babar waited for it to smash it on off but managed a top edge and it was taken easily by Maxwell near point 7.14pm Was that innings a usual Pakistan implosion or did it have something to do with the pitch? That opening stand certainly skews the opinion towards the former but this could still be a decent total. The Australian openers out and so are the fielders. Raza Hasan has the new ball on his debut Raza Hasan to Warner, 1 wide another wide down leg as Warner looks to sweep it with the turn Irfan to Finch, OUT beaten again, has he edged it! Misbah is reviewing it. It was outside off, Finch stayed back to defend it, the ball angled across after pitching on middle and the Pakistan players seem confident of an edge. It didn't look like there was enough evidence to overturn the decision, but there was a noise for sure when the ball passed the bat. Not Babar to Warner, 1 wide pitches outside leg and goes down further for a wide Afridi to Bailey, 1 wide wide down the leg side from short of length as it didn't turn Raza Hasan to Warner, OUT that would have gone for six if Irfan was not at long-on! Warner slog-swept the flighted delivery from well outside off down to long-on. It was surely going for six, but look who's there - Irfan. He jumps and takes a good catch well over his head with his arms stretched, which means the ball was about 10 feet above the ground Afridi to Maxwell, 1 wide quick and down leg for a wide Babar to Maxwell, 1 wide a wide is signalled as this one is down the leg side but Sarfraz says it flicked the pads.. he is right Afridi to Maxwell, SIX runs Maxwell smacks it well! He stays back, spots the marginally short delivery early and he thumps it over wide long on with utter ease.. that is way over the boundary Afridi to Maxwell, 1 leg bye looks for the sweep but this hits the pads and rolls towards short fine leg Raza Hasan to Bailey, OUT direct hit! Bailey is in trouble here. Bailey looked to hit that loopy delivery across the line, but Shehzad dives to his right at midwicket and makes a smart stop.. Bailey had taken off though.. he has to make an about turn.. and Shehzad has a direct hit too.. You see Bailey flat on his belly in the replay, fully stretched trying to Series has been wrapped but there is plenty more to come from the UAE. Another ODI, then the Test matches. We will be back with all the reports and analysis. Thanks for your comments and feedback. This is Dev Fuloria signing off.. ciao ciao. Australia won by 5 wickets (with 40 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 217 for 5 (Maxwell 76) beat Pakistan 215 (Sarfraz 65, Shehzad 61, Johnson 3-40) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Johnson struck at crucial moments in the Dubai afternoon AFP Smart Stats 78.4 Australia's win percentage when chasing a target of 220 or lesser.

"7.00pm Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat Hazlewood to Mohammad Naim, OUT thin edge behind, and gone! A very Test match-like ball to get the first man out. Fullish length on middle with what seemed like a hint of movement away first, but eventually held its line as the batter tried to open the bat face and guide that down to third man. The ball too Zampa to Soumya, OUT appeal for leg before, and the umpire takes his time to give that out! But Soumya reviews. Soumya goes for the sweep first ball against the legspinner, who pitches it full on middle and leg. The ball turned a little into the left-hander, who was hit on the front pad. No inside edge is c Zampa to Mahmudullah, 1 wide full and down the leg side. Wide is called Hazlewood to Shakib, 1 leg bye very full on middle and leg, and angles in further. He flicks, but the ball strikes his pad after an inside edge with Hazlewood going for the slower ball as well Agar to Mahmudullah, 1 leg bye goes for sweep pretty early and goes across off stump as well. But this ball is full on middle and leg, and takes his pad toward the off side Christian to Afif, OUT direct hit! Excellent work from Carey at cover. Was a full delivery driven straight the fielder and he's well short. Carey was side-on, so only had about one stump to aim at Hazlewood to Shamim Hossain, OUT a bit of an ugly heave! Short of a length, goes for a cross-batted swipe and it skews into the midwicket area where McDermott makes good ground and stretches to grab it Christian to Mahmudullah, OUT another direct hit! Australia on target tonight. Henriques this time. A full delivery driven straight to cover, he sets off with the shot, it's a clean pick and he had time to take aim Agar to Mahedi Hasan, 1 leg bye full into the pads, tickled very fine past the keeper...came off the pad Hazlewood to Mahmudullah, (no ball) oh dear, that's come out wrong! It's a head-high full toss...a slower ball that slipped out, attempt at a knuckle ball Ellis to Mahmudullah, OUT but he's cleaned up now! A first wicket for Ellis. Full at the stumps, a rather weary-looking Mahmudullah misses his swing Ellis to Mustafizur, OUT big swing to the leg side, taken at deep midwicket. He's on a hat-trick! Full outside off, swing or bust at this stage, Mustafizur couldn't get the power and distance needed Ellis to Mahedi Hasan, OUT and he's done it! A hat-trick for Ellis. Dropped in short, he went for the pull and it's safely held at deep square Mahedi has the new ball. Over the wicket, with a slip. Nasum to Wade, OUT finds short fine leg with this half-pull! Not as short as Wade would have liked, as this was bowled on middle and leg with the batter swiveling across in his crease only to get the ball off the higher part of the bat to the man inside the circle. Early breakthrough for the hosts Shoriful Islam to Henriques, OUT chipped straight mid-on! He can make amends, that's for sure. Full and straight, Henriques trying to clear the leg side - I think - but just presents a simple chance. Seemed a little in two minds with the shot Shoriful Islam to Marsh, OUT high the air, taken at long-off! Wild celebrations for Bangladesh. Short of a length, Marsh tried to go down the ground but it skewed off the bat. Long-off, Naim, did well to make the ground in and take the catch. Is that the game? Presentationsl coming up Player of the match is Mahmudullah, BDESH","Bangladesh 127 for 9 (Mahmudullah 52, Ellis 3-34, Hazlewood 2-16) beat Australia 117 for 4 (Marsh 51, McDermott 35, Shoriful 2-29) by ten runs Bangladesh marched to an unassailable 3-0 lead to register their first series win against Australia across formats by defending 128 in a close finish during the third T20I in Dhaka. While Mahmudullah led from the front by scoring 52 and batting deep to ensure the hosts had some firepower left late in the innings, Mustafizur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan and Nasum Ahmed combined to apply the brakes on Australia's run chase. Debutant Nathan Ellis' hat-trick went in vain for the visitors, for whom Mitchell Marsh continued his fine form and contributed 51, while Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa chipped in with the ball. The Fizz delivers again Rahman followed figures of 2 for 16 and 3 for 23 in the series with an exceptional return of 0 for 9 from his four overs. In what was the joint second-most economical effort for a Bangladesh bowler in a completed spell, Rahman turned the game around when he conceded just a single in the 19th over of the Australia innings when they needed an entirely possible 23 from 12 balls with Alex Carey and Dan Christian at the crease."
"Zampa to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide floated too full down leg, Rohit goes to sweep but it's too full for the shot and misses leg stump comfortably. Rebowl coming. Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye slower ball on the legs, misses a paddle pull off the hips and the ball caroms to short fine leg. Zampa to Rohit Sharma, OUT so classy for so much of this first hour, Rohit looks very clumsy falling over to this missed sweep and is given lbw. But he's gone for the review! And it's frankly a terrible review. He clearly lost his bearings falling off balance losing any sense of where Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, OUT what just happened there! Dhawan has holed out for 96! It was under the armpit, the line Australia have targeted for so long. Dhawan used the pace, timed it perfectly, but saw it carry straight to the fielder at fine leg. Tremendous innings, but doesn' Zampa to Iyer, OUT scratchy knock comes to an end with an ungainly hoick. Pressure was building ever so slightly on Shreyas, Zampa floats this one up on a fullish length on middle stump, the batsman goes for an impetuous flick heave across the line and misses badly. Middle stump knock Agar to Rahul, SIX runs overpitches it, and pays the price! Full flighted ball, and there's no turn. Rahaul lofts it back over the bowler's head and it cannons into the sightscreen. Gorgeous shot Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gone! Zampa's got Kohli again! What a catch that is! Kohli lofted him straight back over his head, looked for all the world it would go for six but for some incredible work on the boundary. Agar takes a clean catch about six inches from the rope, feels himself Kane Richardson to Pandey, OUT top edged from Pandey, no timing on it and Agar completes a much easier catch this time. Was banged in short and Pandey went for the short arm jab, failing to find the middle of the bat Starc to Rahul, 1 wide dragged down. This is a costly over, and 300 is up for India Starc to Jadeja, OUT and that's Rahul gone. Well done for being so unselfish, to be fair. Went through to the keeper and Rahul as desperate to get back on strike. Carey got the direct hit Cummins to Rohit Sharma, 1 leg bye flicked off the pads for one. 55 in 10 for India, and Peter will take you through the next 10 Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye slower ball on the legs, misses a paddle pull off the hips and the ball caroms to short fine leg. Zampa to Rohit Sharma, OUT so classy for so much of this first hour, Rohit looks very clumsy falling over to this missed sweep and is given lbw. But he's gone for the review! And it's frankly a terrible review. He clearly lost his bearings falling off balance losing any sense of where Starc to S Dhawan, 1 wide seems a concerted plan to frustrate Dhawan down the onside. He tried to help this one aerially over fine leg, too. Something to watch out for Kane Richardson to S Dhawan, OUT what just happened there! Dhawan has holed out for 96! It was under the armpit, the line Australia have targeted for so long. Dhawan used the pace, timed it perfectly, but saw it carry straight to the fielder at fine leg.

Was banged in short and Pandey went for the short arm jab, failing to find the middle of the bat Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs Cummins has tried to be too clever by half. This short ball Rahul was lying in wait for. Just opened the face of the bat and helped it away over third man all the way for six. Incredible shot. Starc to Jadeja, OUT and that's Rahul gone. Well done for being so unselfish, to be fair. Went through to the keeper and Rahul as desperate to get back on strike. Carey got the direct hit Bumrah to Finch, 5 wide full and swinging down leg big time, Rahul dives left but it keeps on swinging all the way to the rope. 5 freebies to the Aussies. Shami to Warner, OUT Pandey! The Barracuda! Length ball angled across fifth stump, Warner spanks this flat toward cover, didn't look like he wanted to keep it down but didn't get the elevation either. Pandey on the ring times his leap perfectly to intercept it with his right hand reach Shami to Smith, 1 wide bouncer goes down leg. Jadeja to Labuschagne, OUT and that's the wicket! Rajkot erupts! He is furious with himself! Came down the track but seemed caught in two minds as regards to whether he should chip it or look to clear the mid-off fielder. Ends up as the most comfortable catch for Mohammad Shami. Huge, Shami to Turner, 1 leg bye huge appeal from India. Full delivery that struck Turner on the toe, but umpire unconvinced. India review It's missing leg stump. Australia still retain that glimmer of hope Shami to Agar, 1 wide drags it down the on side Shami to Starc, 2 leg byes nearly! Another yorker, this time heading for leg stump, Starc plays around it, huge appeal but looked like it was trailing down leg. Given not out and they scamper a pair of leg byes. Shami to Starc, 1 wide another attempted yorker but sprayed down leg to the lefty. Shami to Starc, 1 leg bye another leg stump yorker, misses another flick. Given not out and they hustle another extra. Saini to Agar, OUT yorker on middle stump, traps Agar stone dead in front struck low on the shin. Given out but he's reviewed this in desperation. And sure enough it's three reds. Impact just in line with off stump, but he was deep in the crease, it was ripping out middle.

Stay tuned for more reporting from the ground by Vishal Dikshit. Thanks for staying with us today. For Danyal Rasool, I'm Peter Della Penna. Come back in two days for the series finale at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Tak Player of the match is KL Rahul, INDIA","Australia 105 for 7 (Christian 39) beat Bangladesh 104 for 9 (Swepson 3-12, Tye 3-18) by three wickets It may not rank particularly high in Australia's sporting achievements today as the Olympics draws to a finish, but the cricketers avoided a series whitewash against Bangladesh with a three-wicket win in a low-scoring scrap on a devilishly tricky surface. The home side made them sweat for it, too, and when the chase subsided to 65 for 6 - with 30 of those runs having come when Dan Christian took Shakib Al Hasan for five sixes in an over - it looked like they could pull off an extraordinary victory. However, Ashton Agar produced a calm and clever innings to take Australia to the brink of the target alongside Ashton Turner. This entire series has been hard work for batters, and this match took it to another level. Bangladesh were set back by the excellent Josh Hazlewood, stumbled against the recalled Mitchell Swepson and only crossed three figures in the final over when Mahedi Hasan struck an enterprising 23 off 16 balls."
"Irfan to Finch, OUT and he's gone first ball! He slanted that full and wide, and he went hard at it but the ball sliced off the face of his bat and Ahmed Shehzad takes a good catch at point, diving to his right Irfan to Warner, 1 leg bye back of a length again, sliding down the leg side as Warner misses the flick and ricochets off his thigh pad towards square leg Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 wide slips down the leg side, not too far down, but that's enough for the umpire to exercise his arms in this format Anwar Ali to Smith, SIX runs down the pitch, makes a bit of room, and he launches this way over wide long-off with a full follow-through Afridi to Warner, OUT the breakthrough, Afridi does it, Warner backs away to pull, but hits it low to midwicket, who snaps it up happily Fawad Alam to Bailey, OUT goes for a repeat, and Afridi does the star-man pose after taking a blinder. That wasn't quite as full, and it turned away and he hit it way up in the air. Afridi turned back from short midwicket and ran towards the 30-yard circle and tumbled forward as the Afridi to Smith, OUT charges out, Afridi bowls it full and wide, Smith reaches out and slams it straight to long off Wahab Riaz to Abbott, OUT another one, he charges out, and wants to deposit this short of a length ball down the ground, but only hits it as far as long on Wahab Riaz to Johnson, 3 wide a pretty high full toss now, slips just down leg Wahab Riaz to Haddin, 1 leg bye short of a length on the pad, he tries to force it fine but cannot do much with it Babar to Maxwell, OUT this time he is gone, skips out, and lofts it, he didn't appear to be sure what to do with it, and appeared to have got a touch too close to the pitch, Irfan does not make any mistake as he slides to take it at long off Wahab Riaz to Johnson, OUT Riaz on target finally this over, Johnson makes room, swings and misses, and Riaz hits leg stump with a length ball Kane Richardson to Sarfaraz, 1 wide way outside off from back of length, left for a wide Kane Richardson to Sarfaraz, 1 leg bye full on the pads, flicked down to fine leg for one but it's off the pad Kane Richardson to Shehzad, 1 wide fuller and wider, easily left for another wide Lyon to Sarfaraz, OUT this is a strange dismissal, and Haddin has done so well to hang on to this, Sarfraz falls by the sweep, was through with the sweep a touch early as this offbreak spun in sharply from outside off, and it went straight to the keeper off the back of the bat, hit Johnson to Shafiq, OUT the short ball barrage after spin has worked, there is a clear sound as Shafiq shuffles and tries to play this bouncer down the leg side, and Haddin goes up immediately, was too quick for Shafiq, brushed the glove on the way to keeper Kane Richardson to Umar Akmal, 1 leg bye walks out again, and the ball rolls fine off the pad Maxwell to Irfan, 1 wide spins in down the leg side Maxwell to Irfan, SIX runs that is a massive blow, that is over deep midwicket and out of the ground as Irfan bends forward and slogs What a thorough win for the Australians. It was supposed to be a trial by spin for them but so far it is Pakistan who are getting spun out. Lyon was outstanding on a turner, Maxwell chipping in as well and the pace of Johnson nipping out three too That is all we have from this match. Good night Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 255 for 8 (Smith 101, Afridi 3-46) beat Pakistan 162 (Umar Akmal 46, Johnson 3-24) by 93 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Steven Smith scored his first ODI century to set up Australia's win Getty Images Steven Smith embarked on this tour as a key Test player without a clear role in Australia's one-day side, but his first ODI century might change that. Smith struck 101 to set up Australia's comfortable 93-run victory over Pakistan in the first ODI in Sharjah, where Nathan Lyon, another man just establishing himself in the one-day team, also made an important contribution. Smith was the only batsman from either side who passed 50 and it was thanks to his confident work against spin that Australia reached a competitive 255 for 8. Still, it was a total that Pakistan would have fancied their chances of overhauling had Lyon not struck twice in the 13th over to reduce them from 59 for 1 to 59 for 3 during an excellent spell of off-spin bowling. On a pitch that offered plenty of turn, few batsmen really got themselves in for an extended period and, perhaps surprisingly, it was the Australians who handled the conditions the better."
"Maxwell to Shehzad, 1 leg bye oooh, turn straight away and the Australians are excited. The umpire doesn't share in it and the leg-before appeal goes to waste. Good length ball grips, as Afridi had predicted, and grazes the pad through towards fine leg Maxwell to Awais Zia, OUT he's been trying to force the pace and perishes in the attempt. A swat to mid-off where Richardson picks up a smart catch low to his right. The short ball seemed to hold up on the pitch and he was falling away to the leg side as he sought to bludgeon the ball square on the off side. All he ended up was lobbing it down the ground Maxwell to Maqsood, 1 wide missed stumping! Maqsood had overbalanced as he was trying to flick down the leg side. Beautiful lure from Maxwell worked quite well until Haddin doesn't stay low enough and fumbles Maxwell to Maqsood, OUT timberrrrr! Again his footwork does not afford him enough balance. This ball was a little too full and he got a little too close to it and then drives outside the line. Almost yorked himself as the ball turned from off stump to hit the target Maxwell to Saad Nasim, 5 wide there was a leg slip in play and Maxi tries to get him in the game by tossing the ball up on the pads. Gets a little too much turn than he's used to and beats the keeper, and Finch Boyce to Shehzad, OUT taken at slip! A touch shorter, a touch closer to off stump. Shehzad got back and was trying to cut it away but ends up offering a sharp catch to Finch off an outside edge Kane Richardson to Umar Akmal, OUT why would he play that?! Threw his bat at a length ball like it was the last one he might ever play and skies it. It's a swirlier. Shoots up into the Dubai sky but it's no match for a coolly back-tracking Warner from mid-off Abbott to Afridi, 1 wide banged in short and it lures a hook out of Afridi, but the ball was sliding down the leg side Abbott to Afridi, OUT well, this should help soothe the pain. Fires it in full on off stump, Afridi plans his front leg down and goes for a heave. Misses. Hit in front and the umpire sends him packing Abbott to Wahab Riaz, 1 wide made room for himself, Abbott saw him and slants the ball down leg side. Another tick for the extras. This was at 139kph Kane Richardson to Raza Hasan, 1 leg bye ran away outside off to try and scoop a fuller ball over fine leg. Again no connection and the ball clipped the back pad and almost knocked over the stumps. 9.25 pm Well, Pakistan did not look like they were going to last 20 overs. Not that a score of 96 for 9 is any consolation. Shahid Afridi said this pitch was going to be slow. So it is safe to assume they knew what to expect. But all that went out the window as soon as the first ball began turning - from Glenn Maxwell. He struck thrice in the powerplay. Then debutant Cameron Boyce showed off some delectable skills with his leg spin. The few long hops notwithstanding. There's 9.40 pm Welcome back. The target is not even in triple-figures tonight. Pakistan's spinners have their task cut out for them. But this pitch is offering help. Raza Hasan to start proceedings. Afridi to Smith, 1 wide gets a little off line with a length ball and slides it down the leg side Maqsood to Warner, SIX runs tonk it over midwicket while becoming temporarily right-handed. There really was no risk here, so he jumps around and pummels it over midwicket. Rocks his bat like a cradle to celebrate. He did become a father recently 10.45 pm It turned out to be a tighter chase than was expected. Pakistan tried their best to mask a woeful batting performance. But every ball that David Warner was out there was one ball that was taking the game away. A composed innings from him despite the threat from the pitch and the disciplined bowling. Solid half-century and when one of your top four score that much chasing 97, the result is a foregone conclusion Australia take the one-off T20 game. David Warner took care of the chase. Glenn Maxwell took care of the bowling. Pakistan did their bit to help out as well. But this tour continues. The first ODI begins on Tuesday. So do join us then. Thank you for your comments but for now this is Alagappan Muthu, saying sayonara Australia won by 6 wickets (with 36 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 97 for 4 (Warner 53*, Hasan 2-17) beat Pakistan 96 for 9 (Maxwell 3-13, Boyce 2-10) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia struck regularly to keep Pakistan to 96 for 9 AFP Glenn Maxwell spun out the first three Pakistan wickets on a slow turner as the hosts limped to 96 and lost the only T20 international to Australia by six wickets. Had it not been for 20 extras, the second-highest contributor to the innings after debutant Saad Nasim's 25, Pakistan would have struggled to get anywhere close to 100. Pakistan's spinners, in the absence of the banned Saeed Ajmal, hit back to have Australia 56 for 4, but David Warner sealed the chase in 14 overs with an unbeaten 53 off 39. Shahid Afridi had expected the pitch to play slow and low but it also had plenty of turn, as his top order was to find out after he chose to bat. Pakistan went too hard too soon, and Maxwell made them pay."
"Maxwell to Amla, OUT gone! Maxi's done it as he lures Amla to nick off! This was a fuller delivery drifting further and further away from him, but is tempted by the gap at midwicket. Closes the face in hopes of picking it, but ends up edging to the keeper. Wade pulls off a pretty good take there Watson to de Kock, 1 wide banged in short, a little too short to elicit a shot from the batsman Cummins to Rossouw, 1 wide goes short and it's got a little too much height on it, conveys the square leg umpire to the one at the bowler's end Cummins to Rossouw, OUT and Rossouw cannot capitalise! It was back of a length and outside off, he was looking to baseball-whack it into the leg side. Gets it off the bottom of the blade to present a simple catch to mid-on. One of the first false strokes he has played today, was it because of the powerplay? Cummins to du Plessis, OUT first ball after the break and Faf's gone! It was a slower ball just outside off length, Faf pushed the ball back, but played early and had to check it in the end, the ball went slow and lobbed towards mid off where Bailey had to dive low and in front to his right for a good catch Starc to de Kock, 1 wide but neither are in business as Starc slides a length ball down the leg side Smith to Miller, OUT down the throat of deep fine leg! He's out off a full toss, would you believe it? Goes into a sweep way too early, gets a top edge that is easily pouched by Cummins. South Africa are slipping now, that powerplay has thrown their innings out of balance Cummins to Parnell, 1 wide goes over the top with a bouncer and the ump calls it a wide Faulkner to Parnell, 1 leg bye another slower ball, fuller on middle and leg. Parnell had to check his shot after looking to flick too early. Single towards midwicket Starc to Behardien, SIX runs What. A. Shot! AB would struggle to match that as he backs away and lifts a length ball cramping him for room and lift it nonchalantly over extra cover. Very classy! Faulkner to Behardien, SIX runs heeeeeave, and it clatters into the crowd behind midwicket. Slower ball first up and Behardien went deep in the crease and clobbered it Faulkner to Behardien, OUT length and Behardien goes for the hoick again! He had nailed it, but Steven Smith skirts the rope and picks up a lovely catch to his left and over his shoulders. Top innings, this. The kind that will decide a match Parnell to Watson, SIX runs drags the ball short and Watson is all over it. Swivels on his back foot and unleashes the lot of his power. What did that ball ever do to him? Pulled off the front foot, even as he only needed to shift his balance back McLaren to Watson, 1 wide goes short and slides down leg, looks to pull but can't connect Morkel to Smith, 1 wide banged in short and slips away too far outside off. Smith looks to cut, but can't reach it Australia won by 2 wickets (with 5 balls remaining) (D/L method) Player of the match is Quinton de Kock, SA","Australia 8 for 275 (Watson 82, Finch 76, Smith 67, Peterson 4-32) beat South Africa 6 for 280 (De Kock 107, Behardien 63, Rossouw 51, Cummins 3-54) by 2 wickets (D/L method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Quinton de Kock's sixth ODI ton featured 14 fours Getty Images Australia will enter the World Cup year ranked as the game's top ODI team and with the likes of Steve Smith, Aaron Finch and Shane Watson all running into ominous form, following a fourth victory in five matches over a sloppy South Africa at the SCG. The hosts had more to play for in this fixture than the visitors, and it showed during their chase of 275, reduced from 281 by the second of two brief showers for the day. Finch, Watson and Smith all struck the ball cleanly, though the latter's sublime run of scores was maintained partly by some ordinary work in the field by a South African side missing AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn. Morne Morkel's confidence ebbed away, as epitomised by a dreadful misfield to concede a boundary to Smith, who was also bowled off a Kyle Abbott no-ball and edged Morkel behind though the South Africans did not deign to appeal. Finch and Watson gave less chances, both working their way into decent touch after slow starts to the summer."
"Maxwell to de Kock, OUT Maxwell strikes! It's a good ball, tossed up and angled in towards off stump. He looked to play it towards mid-on, with the angle, but didn't get to the pitch and closed his face too early. Leading edge pops back to Maxwell for the simplest of c&bs. Cummins to de Villiers, 1 wide bouncer outside off. AB simply stands there and lets it go through to the keeper. Bounced comfortably over head height Cummins to du Plessis, OUT gone! That was a good ball, rising uncomfortably from back of a length outside off, and he pokes at it while hopping across and gets an outside edge through to the keeper Faulkner to de Villiers, 1 leg bye down the leg side and AB can't quite connect with the glance. Off his pad towards square leg Starc to Behardien, 1 leg bye looks for the yorker, and Behardien looks to flick. Can't connect, gets a bit of foot on to it through to the keeper Starc to McLaren, OUT got him! That was the slower bouncer again, and he was caught between trying to pull and trying to avoid the ball. Ended up getting a thin edge that looped into Wade's gloves Faulkner to Peterson, OUT gone! That was the slower ball, full and straight, and Peterson looked to slog it across the line, over the leg side. He was through his shot too quickly and the ball sneaked through and crashed into middle stump 6.35pm Here we go again. Australia need 268 to seal the series win. Aaron Finch and David Warner stride out with that aim in their heads, and Dale Steyn is hell bent on preventing them from getting off to a good start. Parnell to Smith, 1 wide down the leg side now and Smith politely moves his bat and body out of the way McLaren to Maxwell, 1 leg bye full, angling down the leg side, and he can't connect with the flick, gets a leg bye down to square leg Behardien to Wade, 1 wide looks to go fuller, ends up sliding down the leg side McLaren to Smith, 1 wide full-toss wide outside off, and that nearly ran away for four wides. De Kock must have stretched a couple of muscles to breaking point in diving across to his right to stop that Steyn to Faulkner, 1 bye shortish slower ball outside off and he plays and misses. de Kock misjudges the bounce behind the stumps and they sneak a quick bye. Steyn, needless to say, is livid 10.35pm Short and sweet presentation ceremony there. No interviews with the captains and so forth. Just how it should be, methinks, but I'd say that, having been typing all this while and being grateful to avoid any more transcribing and whatnot. So that brings an end to our coverage as well. Australia have taken the series 3-1, and South Africa have a lot of Australia won by 3 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 7 for 268 (Smith 104, Wade 52) beat South Africa 8 for 267 (de Villiers 91) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 1:09 Steven Smith seals series for Australia Steven Smith started this series in form but out of the side. Matthew Wade started it out of form but in the side. Together, they set up a series victory by plotting one of Australia's most remarkable one-day international chases, in front of one of the MCG's most remarkably small international crowds. Smith's 104 was reminiscent of Michael Bevan's heroics at the SCG on New Year's Day 1996, delivering victory from a position where defeat seemed inevitable. Smith and Wade came together with Australia's score at 5 for 98 in pursuit of 268."
"Morkel to Warner, SIX runs that's high in the air, has he timed it well enough, he has and it's gone for six!

He spotted the short ball outside off, rocked back and smacked it with a pull over deep square leg Philander to Finch, (no ball) back of length outside off, pulled to midwicket and that's another no ball Philander to Warner, OUT taken at midwicket! It was a length delivery on middle and off, Warner slogged it without much footwork and AB at midwicket had to jump a bit to take the flat catch Steyn to Watson, 1 wide slides it down the leg side for a wide de Villiers to Watson, SIX runs too short this time and Watson pulls it for six! Watson had enough time to see the length and crash it wide of deep midwicket Behardien to Watson, OUT he's got Watson again! Behardien pitched it slightly shorter outside off, Watson slogged on the leg side but didn't get enough of it and long on went to his right to take the skier Morkel to Marsh, OUT he's played the wrong line and lofted it high for an easy catch to AB at long off! It was angled in a bit towards middle and leg, but he lofted it inside out, very high and AB took it with rather ease de Villiers to Finch, OUT AB's got the big wicket of Finch! Regular length delivery on the off stump, Finch went for a wild slog on the leg side and missed it completely. The ball crashed in to off and middle stumps Steven Smith: The wicket slow down in the end and the ball became softer. I tried to get a few boundaries and managed to get a few away. The start we got was perfect and the openers set the foundation for a good score. Kane Richardson to du Plessis, 1 leg bye another lbw appeal, the umpire says no again! It came in sharply from outside off, Faf went back and on his toes and the ball was mising leg for sure Kane Richardson to de Villiers, OUT that's a loud appeal for lbw, umpire says it's out and AB reviews it! Bowden says there's nothing on Hot Spot, it's hitting him in line and is hitting the stumps too, AB has to go.

Miller was struck on the crease as the yorker dipped and swung in, hit him on the front shoe in front of leg stump, was it going down leg? The umpire says it's out and Miller has a few words with the huddle that' Hazlewood to Philander, 1 wide bangs in the bouncer outside off and it's too short, called a wide Starc to Behardien, 1 leg bye shuffles across to the off side to scoop the ball behind square on leg and gets an inside edge on the pads.

In front of a crowd of 10,583 at Manuka Oval, Finch set the platform and Smith capitalised fully upon it against a South African bowling attack that found less assistance than they enjoyed in Perth but also did not help their cause with a quartet of no-balls. Dale Steyn was the lone exemplar of parsimony for the visitors, but even his 10 overs ultimately yielded 53 runs, and he was unable to take the wickets he had yearned for when describing a new attack role for himself on match eve. Aaron Finch and David Warner added 118 for the opening wicket Getty Images A target of 330 was always going to be difficult for the visitors given Australia's selection of a deep and varied bowling attack that in Starc and Hazlewood had relevant experience of Canberra climes. Hazlewood and Starc both bowled piercingly with the old ball, the latter gaining sharp reverse swing to bring a swift conclusion to the match."
"Behardien to Watson, OUT well, well, the part-timer has taken out Shane Watson, and he is not reviewing, Behardien angles it in on a length, it moves in late a bit too, Watson's bat has to come around that big front foot, it cannot do so quickly enough, and he is given straight away, tracker says that is hitting middle and leg near the top Morkel to Bailey, 1 leg bye this climbs in to him, he walks across, and fends it off one hand down to fine leg Morkel to Smith, OUT that is probably not the best stroke to play at this stage, Morkel bangs it in short of a length, Smith tries to force a pull, and Tahir takes the steepling top edge after moving to his left from mid on, mid off was around too, but Tahir hung on in the end, wasn't really the length for the pull Behardien to Marsh, 1 leg bye angled into the pad, rolls to backward square leg Behardien to Marsh, 1 leg bye moving into the pad again, and worked behind square Philander to Wade, 1 leg bye full and outside leg, clipped off the pads to fine leg Morkel to Wade, OUT Keeper and bowler are convinced about the caught behind, umpire isnt, de Kock is pushing for the review immediately, and South Africa are doing that, Wade on the hop to a short of a length ball into the ribcage, it has brushed his shirt, third umpire says that is close to the glove, and wants to look at HotSpot, there is Morkel to Johnson, OUT five for Morkel, and he jumps in celebration, Johnson stuck on the crease to one that leaves him with the angle close to off, and nicks it through to the keeper Steyn to Coulter-Nile, OUT nine down, Faf in business at mid on again, a length ball around middle and off, Coulter-Nile whips it for a tumbling Faf to take his second catch, not easy to pull off these shots with the pace and bounce in the pitch Philander to Bailey, OUT Philander strikes immediately on comeback, and that is a fine catch by Faf, another one falls to the pull, Bailey wasn't on top of the stroke as he hit it off the front foot low to Faf at mid on, and he went down to pouch it Tahir to Marsh, SIX runs he connects big this time, fetches this full and wide one and slogs it over the long on boundary Steyn to Marsh, OUT it is hard to clear Morne Morkel wherever he is, he is at short fine leg, this is a slower one into the pad, and Marsh has flicked it for Morkel to take it over his head Five wickets and two catches for Morne Morkel, who has demolished Australia for 154 on a fast and bouncy WACA pitch. From the moment he had Warner hopping in his first over, Morkel has been difficult to play. South Africa were a bowler short, but Behardien took out Watson and bowled eight decent overs. Morkel returned to crush Australia with three 3.35pm Out come Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock to chase 155. And here's Mitchell Johnson with two regular slips and a fly slip Coulter-Nile to Rossouw, 1 wide flies outside leg stump as he bangs it in short again Maxwell to de Villiers, 5 wide turn and bounce, but down the leg side, and goes between keeper and leg slip Maxwell to de Villiers, 1 wide bounces and spins down the leg side Johnson to Miller, 1 wide Johnson pings in a bouncer, Miller lets it pass over Johnson to Miller, 5 wide Johnson digs in the bouncer too short with plenty of effort, and it flies over Wade's who only gets some glove on it as he jumps Johnson to Miller, 1 wide another bouncer, Miller sways inside the line, it is called a no-ball as Johnson has bowled one too many for the over That is all from this game. Good bye South Africa won by 3 wickets (with 134 balls remaining) Player of the match is Morne Morkel, SA","South Africa 7 for 157 (de Villiers 48, Hazlewood 5-31) beat Australia 154 (Marsh 67, Morkel 5-21, Steyn 3-35) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Morne Morkel took a career-best 5 for 21 Getty Images Morne Morkel wreaked havoc and together with AB de Villiers, wrecked Australia's chances of taking a 2-0 series lead in the second ODI at the WACA. Morkel's career-best 5 for 21 helped to skittle Australia for 154, a total that was barely half of what they made in the first game on Friday and showed how fortunate they were that South Africa dropped so many chances on that occasion. A brisk 48 from 41 scored by de Villiers confirmed the result. The chase was not entirely straightforward for South Africa, who were 2 for 21 after losing both openers early, and wobbled towards the end as Josh Hazlewood completed his first five-wicket haul in ODI cricket. But Hazlewood's efforts were offset by a leaky display from Nathan Coulter-Nile, whose six overs cost 54, and South Africa reached their target with three wickets in hand and 22."
"Philander to Finch, 1 leg bye appeal for lbw, the length delivery seamed in from outside off and hit Finch above the knee roll in front of the stumps and he was a step outside the crease too. HawkEye says that was going over Tahir to Warner, SIX runs too full, Warner goes down on a knee and slog-sweeps it for a massive six to the cow corner boundary. He was playing it with the turn and absolutely middled it Philander to Warner, OUT that's a great catch in the deep from McLaren and the stand is broken! Warner pulled the short ball in the air again, McLaren ran to his left from square leg but the ball was dipping on him and he made sure he swooped down with a dive to get his hands under the ball comfortably to complete the catch Philander to Finch, OUT oh another, Philander gets Finch too! He moved the delivery away from Finch from outside off, the batsman pushed at it away from the body and the ball did enough to take an edge for an easy catch for de Kock Steyn to Clarke, OUT there you go - Steyn gets Clarke's wicket! Steyn banged in a short ball around off, Clarke took a step towards off and pulled but didn't time it properly and the ball ballooned off the glove towards de Kock. You won't see an easier catch than that Steyn to Bailey, 4 leg byes what a delivery to welcome a new batsman! Nast short delivery angled towards Bailey's head, he sways out of the line a bit, then takes his eyes off the ball and it deflects off the back for four over the keeper Tahir to Watson, OUT a catch has been taken - finally! Watson swept the full delivery on the pads to short fine leg and Morkel did well to get low and get his hands under the ball just in time Philander to Marsh, OUT that's gone through, what a delivery from Philander! It pitched outside off and seamed in a bit, Marsh looked to guide it on the off side but left a big gap between bat and pad and the ball sneaked through that to make the bails fly! Steyn to Wade, 1 wide strays down the leg side for a wide Morkel to Bailey, 1 leg bye towards te leg side and it goes off the pad towards square leg for one McLaren to Bailey, 1 wide this slower delivery goes down the leg side as Bailey looked to pull. Wide called for the width now Morkel to Maxwell, OUT it's full this time and it's worked, taken at mid-off! Maxwell made room, got it full and wanted to clear mid-off with a lofted drive but Faf did well to dive forward and to his left for a good low catch. They are checking with the third umpire if it was taken cleanly, it has. And a part of Morkel's heel was marginally inside the crease or it Philander to Wade, OUT outside the off stump, Wade makes room to slice the ball from outside off but finds a fielder in the deep, as Rossow ran in from sweeper cover. He's a sub for Behardien Philander to Johnson, 1 wide full and swinging down leg for a wide Morkel to Johnson, 1 leg bye full and outside off, tapped a bit wide of de Kock for another Morkel to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide too short and wide outside off, called a wide Johnson to du Plessis, 1 bye wider outside off, it's left alone. But they sneak in a bye after Wade fumbles Marsh to de Villiers, 1 wide strays down the leg side past the batsman with a wide Johnson to Miller, 1 wide starts with a bouncer that is too high, and is called a wide Coulter-Nile to Miller, OUT the bowling change as done it, Miller is gone and this strong stand is broken! the length delivery was angled in towards the pads, Miller looked to flick it towards cow corner but played the shot early and even though he looked towards wide long on, the ball went straight to mid on. Marsh takes a few steps back to complete the catch and Johnson to Morkel, 1 wide sends in a short ball down the leg side, it's a wide Johnson to Morkel, 1 wide short ball down the leg side for a wide, good take by Wade down leg Johnson to Morkel, 1 wide another attempted yorker goes down leg for a wide Player of the match is Nathan Coulter-Nile, AUS","Australia 8 for 300 (Bailey 70, Philander 4-45) beat South Africa 268 (de Villiers 80, Miller 65, Coulter-Nile 4-48) by 32 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 0:55 George Bailey rebuilt Australia's innings with 70 from 75 balls Getty Images It was a tale of three captains at the WACA, where Michael Clarke was injured while batting, his deputy-cum-replacement George Bailey rebuilt Australia's innings, and their South African counterpart AB de Villiers threatened to pull off a record chase. Ultimately the difference was in the fortunes of Bailey and de Villiers: Bailey was dropped four times on his way to 70; de Villiers made a chanceless 80, then was run out in a mix-up with a tail-ender. The loss of de Villiers ended any hope South Africa had of overtaking Australia's 8 for 300. Never before had a team made that many to win a one-day international at the WACA, and in the end South Africa didn't get especially close. A 46-run last-wicket stand could not disguise the lower-order collapse - the previous five wickets fell for 20 runs - and South Africa were dismissed for 268, giving Australia a 32-run win and a 1-0 lead."
"7.05pm: Australia have won the toss and will field, they have made one change to their side: Nic Maddinson coming in for Nathan Reardon. South Africa have shaken things up after being hammered in Melbourne, with David Wiese, Robbie Peterson and Marchant de Lange all coming into the XI. Cummins to de Kock, OUT got him, Cummins makes the breakthrough with a fast short ball! Banged in, little bit of cut on the ball and de Kock was hurried trying to pull, just a tickle of glove and it's safely pouched by Dunk Boyce to Rossouw, OUT tossed up, Rossouw charges... and picks out long-on! Success for Boyce, he keeps tossing it up, Rossouw was trying to clear the short, straight boundary - the ball was a little wide, he wasn't to the pitch and dragged it straight to the fielder Bollinger to Hendricks, OUT Dougie does it, Hendricks drags on! The ball was short and there to pull but maybe Bollinger had rolled his fingers over it, the batsman misjudged the stroke, bottom-edged the ball on to his body and then down to shiver leg stump. Falls just short of the fifty mark, like his opening partner Faulkner to Behardien, OUT shortish and taken on... only to pick out deep midwicket! Behardien's brief, painful sally is brought to a close, slogging across the line but never had to the distance to that part of the ground Cummins to Duminy, 1 bye another slower-ball bumper, down the leg side - maybe lucky not to be a wide - Duminy swings and misses but the low bounce foxes Dunk and they take a bye Faulkner to Duminy, OUT tries to get to the pitch, Duminy lifts a length ball to deep midwicket! Another one goes, the SA innings is dribbling to a close... He was hitting across the line and didn't really get hold of it Faulkner to Wiese, OUT gone first ball, edging a pull through to the keeper! Two in three balls for Faulkner, the slump continues. It was another back-of-a-length delivery, Wiese hadn't got his eye in and succeeded only in feathering it through to Dunk Right, take your seats and hold on to your hats. Aaron Finch and Ben Dunk are out in the middle. Kyle Abbott has the new ball Peterson to Dunk, OUT on the attack again - but he's hit it straight into Peterson's bread basket! Really sharp catch and he squeals in celebration... Dunk didn't get to the pitch this time, the ball maybe gripped a little and hit higher up the bat, still flew pretty quickly but Peterson was alert to grab the chance Peterson to Watson, 1 wide fired through, down the leg side as Watson attempts to sweep Peterson to Maxwell, SIX runs ho ho, here we go, that's a beaut of a strike down the ground, many a row into the stand! Skipped out and smashed down the ground, such a clean strike Parnell to Faulkner, 1 wide short again, sprayed across as Faulkner made room for himself, can't reach it and called wide Wiese to Abbott, 1 wide slower ball, Abbott has a swish and misses - but it was just outside the tramline Australia won by 2 wickets (with 1 ball remaining) Player of the match is Cameron White, AUS","Australia 8 for 146 (White 41*, Peterson 3-28) beat South Africa 6 for 145 (Hendricks 49, de Kock 48, Faulkner 3-28) by 2 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Cameron White's composure guided Australia to a fighting, if occasionally flawed, series victory over South Africa in the third and final Twenty20 at Sydney's Olympic Stadium. Another underwhelming crowd - this time 24,187 against a capacity of about 80,000 - confirmed that cricket is more readily appreciated on television than at the ground in early November, irrespective of the format, but Australia's steady improvement after a heavy loss in the first match in Adelaide was a vindication of a somewhat experimental squad and their interim coach Trevor Bayliss. White is not yet a part of Australia's ODI squad with the World Cup now a matter of months away, but Mark Waugh, the selector on duty, could file a glowing report of his cool head to seal this result when others, including Glenn Maxwell and Shane Watson, may have chosen wiser strokes in pursuit of a modest total. Handy stands with Maxwell and James Faulkner, who also bowled neatly in helping restrict South Africa to a mere 6 for 145, allowed White and Australia to creep within sight, though the late wickets of Pat Cummins and Sean Abbott left South Africa in with a chance of stealing a tie or even a win. In the end a pair of white-knuckle singles off the accurate bowling of Kyle Abbott took Australia home, with White now waiting eagerly to see if he will be considered for further limited-overs duty this summer."
"Bollinger to de Kock, 1 wide left-arm over the wicket, starts on a shortish length but this slides down the leg side Bollinger to de Kock, OUT got him, extra pace and bounce and de Kock feathers through to Dunk! Nothing stroke from de Kock, just hung his bat out - but the ball fair zipped through off the surface, seamed a fraction, took a small but visible deflection off the edge and South Africa are one down Faulkner to Rossouw, OUT got him, slower ball and this time the leading edge is snaffled by Faulkner! He's a canny lad in this form of the game, Faulkner, although his back-of-the-hand delivery was heading down the leg side. Rossouw was done by the lack of pace, heaved to leg again, the edge ballooned back down the pitch and the bowler clutched it diving to his right Faulkner to Duminy, SIX runs fetch that! Length ball from Faulkner and Duminy finally sends one over the ropes, meaty swing to leg and the ball sailed h-i-i-i-i-i-g-h over deep square leg Faulkner to Miller, OUT scooped high into the leg side, there's a man under this... gottim! Miller's time is up, aiming for the same boundary that Duminy cleared a few balls ago, got under it but didn't have the distance, taken comfortably a few yards in from the fence Boyce to Hendricks, OUT done him, Hendricks is down the river and stumped without a paddle! Superb work from Boyce, lured the batsman out but the ball dipped and he was nowhere near the pitch, just enough spin to go past the outside edge and he had no chance of regaining his ground Australia won by 7 wickets (with 44 balls remaining) Player of the match is Cameron Boyce, AUS","Australia 3 for 102 (Finch 44*, Parnell 2-17) beat South Africa 7 for 101 (Duminy 49, Faulkner 3-25, Boyce 2-15) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia cruised to one of their most comprehensive Twenty20 wins and kept the series alive after their bowlers restricted South Africa to 7 for 101 at the MCG. Cameron Boyce, Pat Cummins and James Faulkner were all key members of the attack and left little work for the batsmen, who cruised past their target for the loss of only three wickets, with 44 balls remaining. A slightly disappointing crowd of 21,415 saw their fellow Victorian Aaron Finch register his first home victory as the national T20 captain as he steered the chase with an unbeaten 44 from 30 deliveries. Ben Dunk was promoted to open with Finch and moved to 23 from 20 balls before he was caught at mid-on off Wayne Parnell, who also picked up the wicket of Shane Watson for 30. Watson crunched four boundaries off one Ryan McLaren over and gave the fans some entertainment before he was caught trying to launch Parnell over mid-off with 10 runs needed."
"6.40pm News trickling in that Australia have won the toss and have chosen to bat. Rabada to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball angled down the leg side and Finch gets a bit of pad on it down to square leg as he misses the flick McLaren to Finch, OUT and he strikes first ball. It's a slower ball outside off, and Finch goes hard at it, looking to drive on the up, and pops a simple catch to short cover Parnell to White, OUT taken! It was short, wide, and it deserved to be smashed, and White duly smashed it, but Behardien at cover point leaped in the air, arms at full stretch, and plucked it out of the air Duminy to Dunk, 1 leg bye full on middle and leg and he clips it away towards midwicket Tahir to Dunk, OUT tossed up wide outside off. Dunk goes hard at the drive and hits it in the air, and Duminy takes it well at short cover, going down on one knee and taking it above his right shoulder Abbott to Reardon, OUT whatacatch! That was short and rising outside off and he crouched to play the ramp shot. Got a fairly big chunk of bat on it and it went at high pace over de Kock. He leaped high in the air, at full stretch, and came away with the ball stuck in his right glove Abbott to Watson, OUT gone! Yet another batsman hits it in the air at catching height, straight to a fielder. It was full outside off and Watson hit that cleanly but picked out the man at cover, right on the edge of the circle Tahir to Watson, SIX runs short again, on off stump, and Watson clears his front leg and slugs that over the gap between long-on and deep midwicket Abbott to Cutting, OUT gone. Cutting goes deep in his crease and gets under this blockhole delivery, strikes it cleanly, but the straight boundaries here are long and he holes out to Miller at long-on. It's an easy catch but he makes sure there are no stuff-ups, tossing the ball in the air, stepping out of the boundary and back in to re-take the catch Kane Richardson to Rossouw, 1 leg bye down the track now and he follows him down the leg side. Can't get his bat around his pad to flick, and it goes off the pad towards square leg Kane Richardson to Rossouw, 1 wide starts this spell by angling a full ball down the leg side Cutting to Rossouw, 1 wide sees him coming down the track and bounces him. Was well above his head, so it was a fair call of wide from the umpire, but good thinking nonetheless from Cutting Cummins to de Kock, 1 wide bouncer slanted outside off, too high for the batsman to reach Cummins to Miller, 1 wide now he looks to bowl a bit straighter and ends up overdoing it, slants it wide down the leg side 10.17pm And that's as dominant a win as South Africa could have hoped for. They were simply the better side today. Australia went too hard at the ball while batting, trying to mow everything over long-on or midwicket, their bowling was a little one-dimensional and quite often all over the place, and their fielding was ragged. South Africa, in comparison, bowled very goo South Africa won by 7 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) Player of the match is Rilee Rossouw, SA","South Africa 3 for 145 (Rossouw 78, de Kock 46) beat Australia 6 for 144 (Watson 47, Faulkner 41*, Abbott 3-21) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kyle Abbott harried Australia's batsmen and Rilee Rossouw achieved the rare feat of putting Quinton de Kock in the shade during a stand of 129 as South Africa secured a vast opening win in the Twenty20 match at Adelaide Oval. Three days after they were comfortably beaten by a Cricket Australia Invitational XI in Sydney, the tourists combined impressively with ball and bat to deliver Australia's third consecutive international defeat, albeit against two distinctly different teams in two vastly different formats on opposite sides of the globe. The likes of David Warner, Mitchell Johnson and Glenn Maxwell were missed by the Australians, but it must also be acknowledged that Dale Steyn and AB de Villiers were among South Africa's absentees. Abbott and Rossouw were highly capable substitutes, the former's 3 for 21 and the latter's 78 from 50 balls the most telling contributions for JP Duminy's men. Reeza Hendricks was out to a well-pitched delivery from Doug Bollinger in the first over of South Africa's chase, but Rossouw and de Kock had very few difficulties in rattling towards the target and ensuring that by the time they departed the asking rate was negligible."
"Agar to S Dhawan, SIX runs down the wicket, and chips this over the long-off fence. Use of the feet the key, as the line of the ball was wide, but all he needed to do was clear the infield, with the man stationed at mid-off Agar to Rahul, OUT GONE! Chips a length ball in the air, just doesn't get to the pitch of one floated around off. Perhaps gripped a bit on the pitch too, and he just drives this straight to Steve Smith at cover. Loud cheers, as the crowd prepare for Virat Kohli Agar to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye length, and he tries to flick this. Off his pads, towards short fine-leg and they quickly switch ends for a leg-bye Cummins to Iyer, 1 wide dug in short, and Iyer ducks out of the way. Called wide for the length Zampa to Kohli, SIX runs very short ball, and gets the right treatment! Rocks back, and swings this over the long leg fence. Just went over, in the end, but good enough to fetch half a dozen Zampa to Kohli, OUT he's gotten his revenge! Kohli falls to Zampa again! Driven hard, to a ball that was floated around off, and he just couldn't keep it away from Zampa, who takes a sharp chance and then punches the air. Important breakthrough for Australia at this stage, as it exposes the relatively soft underbelly of the Indian batting, with a good way to cover in this innings Starc to Iyer, OUT and the move to bring Starc back has worked.

An easy catch but umpire Shamshuddin is unmoved as everyone looks towards him. Meanwhile, the batsmen are sneaking in single, no direct hit but then the umpire raises his finger. Pant departs after a bit of drama Starc to Thakur, OUT nails the yorker, it was just a matter of time, Shardul fails to get anything on it and the off stump has been knocked out from its groove.

Length ball from Cummins and de Kock mows it into the crowd at deep midwicket! Carved brutally over the leg side for the first boundary of the day Zampa to de Kock, 1 run smashed over deep midwicket for six SMITH!! You cannot do that... Brilliantly caught on the boundary as he dives beyond the rope, and then hurled back in before touching the ground! Keeps them to one! Amazing Kane Richardson to Hendricks, OUT short ball, pace off... and pulled to deep square leg! Laboured innings from Hendricks, who was done by the legcutter from Richardson, bowling well to his field. Safely taken by Dre Russ/Sir Jaddu in the outfield Agar to de Kock, 1 leg bye darted on the stumps, straightening a touch and skids into the pads as de Kocks sweeps... not given and there'll be no review Kane Richardson to van der Dussen, OUT Rassie holes out to deep square leg! The legcutter does the job again, nothing for van der Dussen to work with as he swings for the pickets, safely taken a few yards in from the rope Starc to Rohit Sharma, OUT Warner takes a low catch at mid-off. Cross seam and not that full, was angling away from the batsman. Rohit looks to hit it down the ground but it comes slower off the surface. The bat faces closes a touch too early as well. As a result it goes tamely towards Warner, just carrying to him. Think Rohit was looking to go over extra cover Agar to Rahul, OUT GONE! Chips a length ball in the air, just doesn't get to the pitch of one floated around off. Perhaps gripped a bit on the pitch too, and he just drives this straight to Steve Smith at cover.

Dhawan top-scored with 74 but India were all out for 255 in 49.1 overs. Starc picked up 3 for 56, and bowled eight yorkers in the game. He has never bowled that many in an ODI, Bharath tells me. Starc reckons the dew may make the ball come easier onto the bat in the second innings. We will be back with the chase 5.40pm Back for the chase, not long from now. KL Rahul has the wicketkeeping pads on. That's an interesting update. India will look for quick wickets, and I also think scoring becomes a bit tougher on this pitch once the ball softens a bit. Lots to play for just yet Bumrah to Finch, 1 leg bye length, and he whips this towards fine leg. Off the pad, says the umpire Shami to Finch, 1 leg bye length, jags back in, and he looks to play this towards the on side. Off the pads, and going down leg, but drops towards square leg Thakur to Warner, 1 wide short, but down the leg side. Warner lets this pass Jadeja to Warner, SIX runs length, around off, and he has swung this wide of deep mid-wicket. All the way, and hits the boundary skirting on the full Jadeja to Warner, 1 wide length ball sliding down the leg side, Warner was over-balanced while going for a flick, Rahul fails to collect but it brushed only the pad. The umpire though signals wide Kuldeep to Finch, 1 wide length ball down the leg side and spinning further away, called a wide Kuldeep to Warner, SIX runs flighted outside off, Warner skips down the track, wasn't to the exact pitch of the ball but with the mid-on up, he goes for it and makes a good enough connection to clear the boundary on the full Thakur to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball on the pads, misses the flick but gets another leg-bye Jadeja to Finch, 1 leg bye fuller on the toes, misses the flick but gets a leg-bye to short fine leg Shami to Warner, 1 wide short, called wide as it bounces well over his head Bumrah to Finch, 1 leg bye length, and he whips this towards fine leg.

Called a wide Shami to Warner, 1 wide short, called wide as it bounces well over his head This is just the third time in ODI history, that a team has won a match by 10 wickets when chasing 250 or more. Interestingly, the teams to suffer each time have all been Asian ones! 8.49pm Well, that spanking out of the way, let's look ahead to the second ODI, which now provides Finch and his men a chance to wrap this series up in just two games. It's goodbye for now, from Chandan Duorah, Hemant Brar, and myself, Debayan Sen. We'll see you in Rajkot on January 17 to see if India can bounce back and keep this series alive. Australia won by 10 wickets (with 74 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Bangladesh 127 for 9 (Mahmudullah 52, Ellis 3-34, Hazlewood 2-16) beat Australia 117 for 4 (Marsh 51, McDermott 35, Shoriful 2-29) by ten runs Bangladesh marched to an unassailable 3-0 lead to register their first series win against Australia across formats by defending 128 in a close finish during the third T20I in Dhaka. While Mahmudullah led from the front by scoring 52 and batting deep to ensure the hosts had some firepower left late in the innings, Mustafizur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan and Nasum Ahmed combined to apply the brakes on Australia's run chase. Debutant Nathan Ellis' hat-trick went in vain for the visitors, for whom Mitchell Marsh continued his fine form and contributed 51, while Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa chipped in with the ball. The Fizz delivers again Rahman followed figures of 2 for 16 and 3 for 23 in the series with an exceptional return of 0 for 9 from his four overs. In what was the joint second-most economical effort for a Bangladesh bowler in a completed spell, Rahman turned the game around when he conceded just a single in the 19th over of the Australia innings when they needed an entirely possible 23 from 12 balls with Alex Carey and Dan Christian at the crease."
"Ashwin to Johnson, OUT he has missed this one completely! Johnson steps out early to slog it over the leg side but this drifts in and slides through the gap. Dhoni does the rest. Johnson doesn't even look back. Knows he is gone the moment his misses it Ashwin to Harris, OUT and he misses a straight ball to be given out lbw! He went for the big sweep and missed it completely. That would have hit the stumps Shami to Lyon, OUT swings and misses a straight one, that one hits the leg stump. Lyon doesn't really care. He has done the job of rubbing it in. Yadav to Smith, OUT he has lost his middle stump! He goes all the way to the off side to play a ramp shot, but misses a straight delivery. It strikes the top of middle stump. To be frank, the bowlers never looked like taking that wicket and it was up to Smith to do something crazy to give it away Hazlewood to Rahane, 1 leg bye this one is slipping down the leg side, rolls on to fine-leg after hitting the pads. Those are your first extras in this innings Lyon to Rahane, OUT and there is the breakthrough! Rahane looks to repeat the sweep shot but this is much straighter and fuller from Lyon, he misses and his hit on the back pad. The umpire takes time and then raises his finger. Rahane gets a pat on the back from Kohli and a standing ovation from the crowd as he walks back. Superb innings from him. Lyon to Rahul, OUT he's gone next ball, it was full and well outside off, hitting the rough as well, Rahul goes for an expansive sweep, top edges that towards backward square leg, simple catch and it is not put down this time, there's plenty of hype around Rahul, but he's played a couple of strange shots in his short debut innings Harris to Ashwin, OUT and here's another one! Harris takes a tumbling catch in his follow through. Ashwin drives at this fuller delivery and is not able to keep it down, Harris stretches his right hand out, is not able to cling on. Luckily the ball doesn't get away from him and he is able to make a second grab at that Johnson to Kohli, OUT and he gets the big wicket! After 29 overs of toil, Johnson has something to show. But check that out for a catch from Haddin. He dives full length to his right and plucks it in front of first slip. It was going straight into Watson's hands. Kohli tried to chase that full and wide delivery, but got a thick outside edge. Innings Start Jared: ""Brad Haddin sledging Kohli by shouting ""It's all about you!"" at him on TV. The irony is palpable.""","Australia 530 (Smith 192) and 9 for 318 dec (Marsh 99, Rogers 69) drew with India 465 (Kohli 169, Rahane 147, Harris 4-70) and 6 for 174 (Kohli 54) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Australia did not need to win, and India never really thought seriously about doing so. A curiously muted final day of the Boxing Day Test petered out with four overs still to bowl; on recent evidence more than enough time to winkle out the visitors' last four wickets. A draw was enough for Australia to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy under the stand-in captaincy of Steven Smith, and also enough for MS Dhoni's India to avoid a series whitewash. So hands were shaken, backs slapped and stumps drawn. Despite the odd moment of rancour - Virat Kohli versus Brad Haddin - or transcendence - Mitchell Johnson's ripping cutter to bowl Cheteshwar Pujara - this always seemed the most likely result."
"Lyon to Vijay, OUT ... and it's paid off. Vijay comes down the track and goes for the big hit again. Was making room to go over mid-off and it went with the angle past his outside edge and Haddin makes the easy stumping. Hang on, they've had another look at it, and there was a thin edge through to the keeper, so it's a caught behind and not a stumping. Hazlewood to Rahane, OUT that is the best ball of the Test match. Lovely length, caught Rahane on the crease, angling in towards off stump and curling away late. Rahane had to play at it, and it kissed his edge through to Haddin, who takes his fifth catch of the innings Starc to Ashwin, 1 wide this one's dug in very short and Ashwin leans away and watches it through to the keeper Hazlewood to Ashwin, OUT got him! That was a beautiful length outside off, a bit of movement away off the pitch. Ashwin's bat comes down at an angle as he looks for the drive, and Watson takes a waist-high catch at first slip Hazlewood to Dhoni, OUT that's five on debut! A bit of inward movement from a good length. Dhoni was looking to leave, made the decision late, and the ball clipped his inside edge as the bat went up and Haddin takes a sixth catch Lyon to Aaron, OUT that's a stunner at short leg! Classic offie's dismissal, loop and dip, turn and bounce from outside off as he pushes forward to defend. Pops up into the leg side, and the substitute fielder at short leg, Marnus Labuschagne, moves in in a flash and dives forward to take it with his right hand, inches off the ground. I'm not sure whether it was bat-pad or bat tucked Lyon to Yadav, OUT And that is that. Umesh goes for the slog-sweep from outside off, and he picks out Rogers at deep midwicket 12.11pm Lunch, and Australia will feel much better than they did at the start of the day's play. Hazlewood bowled quite beautifully to finish with a five-for, and he looked like taking wickets whenever he hit that right length. India's seamers will have watched that, but will they be able to bowl in those right areas? If they do, they could put Australia under pressure, considering they have around the wicket now Aaron to Starc, 1 wide another bouncer, and Dhoni has to leap and stretch his right arm way over his head to catch that after Starc moves his head away from the line Aaron to Starc, 1 leg bye full, angling down leg. Misses the flick and it pops off the pad into the off side Innings Start 2.05pm Warner and Rogers are out in the middle. Ashwin gives Warner a pat on the back, and Warner pats Ashwin back on his back. Lots of backs in there. Who's coming in with the new ball, to bend his back? It's Ishant.","Australia 505 (Smith 133, Johnson 88) and 6 for 130 (Rogers 55) beat India 408 (Vijay 144, Rahane 81) and 224 (Dhawan 81, Johnson 4-61) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 3:03 Is there a way back for India? Australian resilience was writ large across a four-wicket victory over India that will look a little fortunate in the scorebook without reference to the dressing-room scenes on day one, when India seemed set fair for a mighty first innings and Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood were all either lost to injury or weakened by fatigue. Hazlewood's recovery from full-body cramps to prise out India on the second morning set-up the match, and the combined efforts of the new captain Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Chris Rogers, Starc and Nathan Lyon ultimately allowed the hosts to overwhelm India by a greater margin than the first Test in Adelaide. For Smith it was a significant triumph, emerging victorious after a first day he described among the toughest he had ever endured, as either player or captain. MS Dhoni's men were adequately placed to fight their corner when day four began, but they crumbled in the face of concerted pace and pressure from Johnson on a pitch that had begun to deteriorate. Only Shikhar Dhawan, who did not walk out to bat at 10am because he had been struck on the wrist in the practice nets, offered any sustained resistance, and his dismissal lbw to Lyon after lunch heralded a swift end to India's innings."
"Aaron to Marsh, OUT taken at gully and Kohli throws the ball high up in the air. Extra bounce gets rid of Marsh. Tight line just outside off to force the batsman to push and the variation that a new cherry provides takes care of the rest. India desperately needed that Shami to Lyon, OUT through him! Shami has made an important break. It was a good length ball targeting middle. Lyon did not move forward enough to counter the ball moving back in and it takes an inside edge, gets the top flap of the pad and hits timber Shami to Haddin, OUT there it is, India have ended the day on a high! Haddin was struggling around the off stump and this time the edge carries through to the keeper. Beautiful delivery, and that is what the new ball can do and then placing it in the right areas - on and around off stump with some late seam away Karn to Clarke, OUT no mistake this time. Clarke goes for a sweep and has found square leg. Adelaide stands up to appreciate their captain. The coach pats him on the head as he walks back, his family is there as well. Looks quite weary as he walks off. Steven Smith has continued making a name for himself in Test cricket, and at times batted like he was two different people. A polished strokemaker for much of the innings and then a slog-overs specialist in the latter half. Michael Clarke strode out at the start of the day, back injury and all, and his sudden appearance seemed to have wilted Johnson to Kohli, OUT down the throat of deep fine leg and Johnson has picked the big wicket! It's the bouncer again, it's on middle, it came at the batsman too early and the top edge swirls to Ryan Harris who rushes in and dives forward to take it. The front-foot check looks scary, but Johnson has a couple of millimeters behind the l Lyon to Rohit Sharma, OUT he's caught it! What a soft dismissal! It was a loopy delivery outside off and Rohit has come down the track to try and nudge it away. But all he's managed is return the ball back into the bowler's hands. Lyon had to dive to his right off his followthrough and just about holds on. Australia badly wanted that Lyon to Saha, OUT he's gone! Lyon keeps troubling everyone. But did it hit the bat? It was a gorgeous offspinner that brought the right-hander forward to block. The turn beats his inside edge, hits the pad and umpire Gould must think it kissed the glove on the way to first slip. I didn't see anything though... Innings Start Shri: ""As India gets to 100, can't help but think that throughout this game, India has lost one more wicket than they should have (100/1 at lunch was good, 100/2 is Australia's session). I think this is going to prove one wicket too many in the end.""","Australia 7 for 517 dec (Smith 162*, Warner 145, Clarke 128) and 5 for 290 dec (Warner 102) beat India 444 (Kohli 115, Lyon 5-134) and 315 (Kohli 141, Vijay 99, Lyon 7-152) by 48 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A gladiatorial battle between bat and ball took place on the final day at Adelaide Oval, where a Test that had begun in sorrow a week after the death of Phillip Hughes was given a dazzling finish that highlighted the greatness of this game. India's champion was Virat Kohli, a debutant captain with his sight fixed on a formidable target while all but one of his team-mates failed to show similar steel. For Australia, it was the spindly Nathan Lyon, suffering unsympathetic umpiring to single-handedly drag his team back into the contest, making up for the bluntness of his faster colleagues. The Test was decided when Kohli pulled Lyon and was caught at deep midwicket, leaving Australia with 60 to defend and three wickets to take. They won by 48 runs."
"News from the 'G' is that Australia have won the toss and asked Sri Lanka to bat first. It's the first time in seven limited overs matches that the tourists will bat first, if I'm not mistaken. They have built each of their three victories on bowling first, so it will be interesting to see how they react to having to set a score, and indeed, how A Faulkner to Dilshan, OUT slower ball again, and this time he bowls him! Dilshan tried to pull that one, but it didn't bounce as high as he expected. It takes an under edge and clips off stump. I think the slowness of the ball did him in there. Starc to Perera, 1 wide way down leg, and Wade dives well to stop that from being only one wide Laughlin to Chandimal, OUT that is an awful looking shot. Short outside off stump, Chandimal tries to heave that over mid on with a cross-bat shot, but is too late on the stroke, and ends up scooping it to Bailey at mid off. Didn't look too comfortable, despite the boundary Faulkner to Perera, SIX runs great hitting from Perera. Short of a length slower ball on the stumps, Perera clears the hip and smashes that high over cow corner. Laughlin to Perera, SIX runs top edged six! No luck there for Laughlin, but it's been that kind of day for Perera. Length outside off stump, Perera tries to wallop that over mid on, but it gets a thick outside edge and flies over the fine leg rope Good innings by Mahela, to hold things together after three wickets fell quickly. Perera played a blinder, as Australia's bowlers shied away from bowling yorkers at the death. But the good start for Australia means that 161 is probably just about par. Kulasekara to Warner, OUT beautifully bowled by Kulasekara. That was right on a good length and moving away off the seam, Warner tried to hit that through the leg side, but the movement means he got a leading edge which lobs to Thisara Perera at mid off. Sri Lanka silence Warner early. Kulasekara to Finch, 1 leg bye length on the legs, deflects to square leg In the end, you've got to say Sri Lanka deserved to take it out. The D/L recalculation made things a touch tougher for them, but they gritted it out well, even with a damp ball. A valiant effort from Marsh and Bailey, but Australia just gave away too much ground in the early overs. That's about it for our coverage for this cracker of a match. Glad you could be with us. So Sri Lanka finally have something to take away from the tour, even if it was just in the Twenty20s. Until next time, ciao! Player of the match is Thisara Perera, SL","Sri Lanka 4 for 161 (Jayawardene 61*, T Perera 35*) beat Australia 3 for 119 (Marsh 47*) by 2 runs (D/L method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mahela Jayawardene top scored for Sri Lanka Getty Images Thisara Perera was the difference with the bat and then held his nerve, although only barely, with the ball to seal a two-run victory off the final delivery of a rain-reduced chase. In a heated finale, Glenn Maxwell needed four runs from the last ball for victory and was frustrated by a long conference held by several Sri Lanka players before the delivery was bowled, and when Perera sent down the ball wide of off Maxwell missed and all the batsmen could manage was a bye. The Sri Lanka players were jubilant but there were tense scenes as the players walked off, Maxwell clearly annoyed at the Sri Lankans, and even the handshakes involving players who weren't on the field at the end became testy. It became that kind of night when rain interrupted Australia's chase of 162 and despite the shower being short, the umpires did not allow play to restart for 45 minutes due to difficulties drying the outfield. When the rain arrived after 10 overs, Australia were 15 runs behind on the Duckworth-Lewis score at 2 for 60."
"Australia have won the toss and opted to bat at Stadium Australia. We're waiting on the team lists, but news is that Ben Cutting will get a Twenty20 debut. Angelo Mathews to Warner, 1 leg bye back of a length again, Warner misses with his pull and they scamper a leg bye Perera to Marsh, OUT direct hit, and out! Marsh was clearly rattled there, and desperate to get off strike. Lenght outside off stump, Marsh defended that and took off, and the ball dribbled towards Dilshan, who swooped in and underarmed the throw, to beat Marsh back to the Perera to Bailey, OUT Bailey pinpoints Dilshan with an open-faced drive. Poor stroke you've got to say. Fullish wide delivery, drilled straight to the fielder, who gobbles it at waist height. Mendis to Voges, 1 bye full and angled into Voges, who misses the ball, and the keeper can't collect either Warner's has been a good innings, and it may turn out to be a match-winning one as the pitch is a little two-paced. But Sri Lanka's bowlers did very well to contain Australia, and they were backed up well in the field. We'll be here with the second innings in less than ten. Cutting to Perera, SIX runs super shot that. Back of a length outside off stump and he stood his ground and bludgeoned it corss-batted over long on for six. Starc to Dilshan, 1 wide this one is a wide. Short ball down leg side. Doherty to Perera, 1 leg bye pitches outside leg and straightens, Perera tried to glance that, but it hits his pads and they take a leg bye Maxwell to Perera, OUT gone! And Perera's promising innings ends. Length ball spinning away and bouncing outside off stump. Perera rocked back to cut it, and gets a top edge to Wade, who pouches a decent deflection. Good innings from Perera though, while Dilshan struggled. Maxwell to Chandimal, OUT down the track, and he holes out trying to clear the short, straight fence. Didn't quite get to the pitch of the ball there, and mistimed it off the toe end. Cutting takes it securely above his head and Sri Lanka need someone to stand up here, or Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT bowled! That's a wicket Australia really needed. Mahela is done in by the dip there. Tried to turn it to the on side, but it's full and it sneaks under the bat to hit the pad, and then take off stump. Starc to Thirimanne, OUT backs away and picks out backward with an aerial square drive. It was fullish and on the stumps, Thirimanne gets that on the outside of his bat and it flies to Voges, who takes a sharp chance above his head. Australia still very much in this. Anot Laughlin to Angelo Mathews, SIX runs shot! Overpitched and punished. Mathews stood his ground and struck that clean back over the bowler's head and way over the boundary. So Sri Lanka will retain their no. 1 ranking, regardless of the result of the next match. Daniel Bretting's report has been updated here.

After their bowlers had been brilliantly supported in the field to restrict Australia to 3 for 137 - of which Warner made no fewer than 90 - the Sri Lankans made a rapid start to the chase and then steadied against the loss of mid-innings wickets to take a 1-0 lead with seven balls to spare. Angelo Mathews showed the cool head that has him marked as his nation's long-term leader to finish off the innings. There were cameos, too, from Kushal Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne and Thisara Perera, all of whom will be happy that Sri Lanka cannot now lose this series after also tying the ODI matches. Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera were both exemplary with the ball, though Kulasekara undid much of his good work by turfing the simplest of chances at deep midwicket when Warner had made only 69."
"Perera to Bailey, OUT would you believe it? Perera has conjured a wicket out of nowhere. Fullish ball, seemed to hang in the pitch for a moment and Bailey was too quick on the shot. He ends up lobbing that straight back to the bowler, who takes a decent catch, bending low on his follow through. Malinga to Hussey, 1 wide attempted yorker fired down the leg side. Chandimal does well to collect. McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide angled too far down the leg side. Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT that was somewhat out of the blue. Seems to have stuck in the pitch more than Mahela expected. He was aiming a shot through mid off, but gets an inside edge and it lobs to mid on, who takes a simple catch. Doherty delivers the breakthrough Australia needed. Johnson to Thirimanne, 1 wide fired down leg side, Thirimanne can't get a touch on it Doherty to Dilshan, 1 leg bye on leg stump again, and that collects a pad on its way past Matthew Wade Doherty to Thirimanne, OUT poor option from Thirimanne, and Sri Lanka are throwing away a decent start. He came down the pitch and tried to loft that over midwicket, only he hit it too straight and David Hussey at long on ran around to swallow it. It was the result of some good pressure, but he will feel that tha Henriques to Dilshan, OUT Henriques strikes! Dislhan edges an innocuous delivery behind, and leaves Sri Lanka in trouble. He hasn't looked himself at all in this innings and has taken 48 balls for 19. Pressure on the young middle order now, and Australia will feel they are on top now, the way the pitch is playing Starc to Perera, 1 leg bye angled down the leg side and that is glanced to fine leg for a single Johnson to Angelo Mathews, 1 leg bye hits Mathews on the pads with a length ball and the batsman take a leg bye Johnson to Perera, OUT gone! Johnson gets one to bounce a little more than they have and Perera gets a big top edge as he tries to work that into the leg side. David Warner at mid wicket waits for an eternity for it to come down, and takes the catch comfortably. Another big blow and Sri Lanka are sliding quickly McKay to Jeevan Mendis, no run a slower ball outside off stump, and Mendis tries to run that off the blade, but can't beat short third man. Six off the over again. Not good enough for the visitors by a long shot. Starc to Angelo Mathews, 1 wide fires one down the leg side McKay to Angelo Mathews, 1 leg bye slower again, back of a length, tucked into the leg side Looks like we can't bring the presentation to you today, but thanks for being with us. If I can hazard a guess I'd say Phil Hughes will win the man of the match, and Nuwan Kulasekara is the player of the series, but Hughes has an outside shot of taking that out too. Those would by my two picks anyway. This series is shared, but there's more to come from the tour, when the first of two Twenty20s kicks off on the 26th at the SCG. Join us then for more commentary. Player of the match is Phillip Hughes, AUS","Australia 5 for 247 (Hughes 138*) beat Sri Lanka 215 (Mathews 67, Doherty 3-21, Henriques 3-32) by 32 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Phillip Hughes scored his second hundred of the series Getty Images On debut, Phillip Hughes scored a century to give Australia a 1-0 lead in this series. In the final game, he made another hundred to save Australia from series defeat and salvage a 2-2 result. Set 248 to win the game and the five-match contest, Sri Lanka struggled early, staged a plucky fightback led by Angelo Mathews, and ultimately fell short as Australia's bowlers backed up the fine work of Hughes, whose unbeaten 138 was all the more important in a batting line-up missing Michael Clarke. Australia's captain had been ruled out due to an ankle injury suffered at training on the day before the match and it left the Australians with a flimsy looking batting order that featured the allrounders Glenn Maxwell and Moises Henriques at Nos. 6 and 7."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. Still waiting for word on the SL line-up. Kulasekara to Hughes, 1 wide drifts just wide down the leg side, the batsman tries to clip it away fine Kulasekara to Hussey, OUT Appeal for a caught behind and Hussey has been given not out, and SL are reviewing it. This one nips back in from outside off, Hussey was looking to cut, there was a sound as the ball passes the bat and Perera takes it well diving to his left. Kettleborough didn't pick it up and Mahela wanted it reviewed, Hot Spot s Kulasekara to Bailey, OUT Bailey pads up and Aus have lost two in two! Kulasekara's inswing is really causing trouble to the right-handers, moved back in and Bailey was forward and across to shoulder arms, the ball hits his pads and he was in front of the off stump Kulasekara to Clarke, 1 wide sharp bouncer but Kulasekara is penalised for height Kulasekara to Clarke, OUT The middle stump has been pushed back and Kulasekara has picked up his fourth! He gets the Australian captain, Kula's inswing to the right-handers is causing havoc at the Gabba, Clarke was looking to play down the ground but left a gap between pad and bat, the ball sneaked through and knocked back the stump Kulasekara to Henriques, OUT Five for the road for Kula and Australia are a trainwreck at the Gabba! That inswing again, needs no further mention, Henriques gets across and he too is bowled through the gate, hits the top of the stumps Malinga to McKay, OUT caught behind! This could have sent back even a genuine batsman, Malinga gets this one to move away from the right-hander, McKay was caught at the crease and couldn't move across to cover the line, thin edge and Perera takes it Malinga to Johnson, OUT the attrition rate gets worse for the hosts! Malinga gets this one to move towards middle stump from over the wicket, Johnson tries to work it away to the on side, the ball hits his pad and then heads towards middle stump, almost through the gate Malinga to Wade, OUT Now even that score of 70 looks days away! Soft dismissal for Wade, this was pitched up and moving away from the left-hander, he tries to steer it square on the off side but ends up spooning a catch to backward point Eranga to Doherty, OUT so 74 it is! Soft dismissal to end the innings and fitting too when you look at the scorecard, he was trying to work it to the on side, leading edge popped up to cover McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Warner takes a brilliant one at backward point! That will lift Australia's sagging spirits, this was short and wide outside off, Mahela was on his toes to cut that, moved quickly to Warner's left and he threw himself to his left and took it with both hands, sharp reflexes Starc to Dilshan, 1 wide that was too short and wide and Dilshan couldn't resist, slashed and missed and he was beaten for pace and bounce Johnson to Angelo Mathews, OUT Sri Lanka have lost two in two and the hosts are smiling again! Mathews gets a brute of a delivery from Johnson, it was short of a length and gaining on his body, he had barely enough time to make up his mend whether to duck or fend it off, took his eyes off the ball and the top edge lobbed tamely to Starc who Sri Lanka are 2-1 up ahead of the 4th ODI, They won't be so happy about the way they chased this, but that's a worry for another day. They can afford to savour 74 all out today. Great performance in the field. Clarke was clearly peeved with himself for the way he and his team played. Nice to see a captain be so honest about his own team. Not all captains in world cricket today can say 'yes we messed up real bad.' You have to admire Clarke for that. Sri Lanka won by 4 wickets (with 180 balls remaining) Player of the match is Nuwan Kulasekara, SL","Sri Lanka 6 for 75 (K Perera 22*, Johnson 3-11) beat Australia 74 (Starc 22*, Kulasekara 5-22, Malinga 3-14) by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Nuwan Kulasekara destroyed Australia with lethal inswing Getty Images A fearsome spell of inswing bowling from Nuwan Kulasekara was the definitive performance in a bizarre third ODI at the Gabba, where both captains would have batted first, but 100 may have been a winning total. Kulasekara took a career-best 5 for 22 as he damned Australia to 74 all out, with the aid of Lasith Malinga, who tore down the tail. Sri Lanka's run chase shaped as a straightforward one, but they lost six wickets before they reached their target, meaning 16 wickets had been lost in the day for 149 runs. Had Australia held early chances off Tillakaratne Dilshan and Lahiru Thirimanne, they may have won early the momentum to spark a heavier collapse, but instead the visitors limped home in the 20th over, with their last recognised batting pair at the crease. Having rested several key players for the first two matches, Australia returned to near-full strength at Brisbane, with Michael Clarke, David Warner and Matthew Wade arriving to bolster the batting, but none of them could make it to double figures."
"Mendis to Hussey, 1 wide slides that one down the leg side and it's called a wide, goes straight on, no spin there Angelo Mathews to Maxwell, OUT Six down! Mathews strikes, lovely delivery, just outside off stump, drew the batsman forward with a good length and got it to nip away just a touch, Maxwell was committed to the drive as he walked forward, got a thin edge and Perera made no mistake behind the stumps Mendis to Haddin, 1 bye what a beauty, tossed up, lured Haddin forward for a defensive push, batsman leaves a massive gap between and pad, the ball spins in and bounces, somehow contrives to miss the stumps Malinga to Cutting, OUT gone! Malinga strikes, Perera takes his third catch, pitched up outside off and Cutting tries to drive it through cover, gets a thick edge and Perera dives to his right to snap that one Malinga to Kane Richardson, OUT Oh dear, a first baller on debut, a deceptive slower one from Malinga, Richardson didn't spot it, it died low on the batsman and Richardson missed it to be struck low on the pad, perhaps just in line with leg stump, he's got to go Perera to McKay, OUT appeal for a catch, short of a good length outside off, tries to open the face there to play it past point, it's given not out but the Sri Lankans have reviewed it, Hot Spot shows no heat signature, the umpire is taking his time to decide this, no real sound in live motion, the appeal was spontaneous but no strong technical evidence there of a Mendis to Haddin, OUT Haddin holes out, found deep midwicket, pitched on a length and he sensed a chance, swung it hard but flat and straight to Thirimanne in the deep Sri Lanka have an excellent chance of levelling this series now. Australia have been bowled out for a sub-par score, even on a track and in conditions that have favoured bowlers a bit more. Haddin's done a good job but his side has been bowled out with 19 balls to spare in the first innings. A collective bowling display from the visitors. Join us at around 6.30pm for the Hello all, we are ready for the chase now. Tharanga and Dilshan are out in the middle. The target is just 171. Bright sunshine in Adelaide. We start with two slips. McKay is the bowler. Kane Richardson to Dilshan, 1 leg bye sliding on the pads is Richardson, at 134.9kmph, tried to flick it square, didn't connect, did with the pads though Kane Richardson to Dilshan, 1 leg bye slightly short on leg stump, tries to turn it down, think it clipped the pads on the way down to fine leg Maxwell to Thirimanne, 1 wide fires that one down the leg side and it's a wide A comfortable win for Sri Lanka, each team dominating a game this series. The bowlers first did the job, and Dilshan and Thirimanne ensured there were no major hiccups in the chase of 171. Daniel Brettig's report should be ready soon. We don't have any coverage of the presentation. Thanks for tuning in and sending us your feedback, and we'll be back with you for the thir Sri Lanka won by 8 wickets (with 59 balls remaining) Player of the match is Lahiru Thirimanne, SL","Sri Lanka 2 for 172 (Thirimanne 102*, Dilshan 51) beat Australia 170 (Haddin 50, Malinga 3-32) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Angelo Mathews formed part of a tight Sri Lankan bowling unit at Adelaide Oval Getty Images Sri Lanka's coach Graham Ford expected far better from his men after an abject display in the first ODI, and in Adelaide they duly delivered. A highly disciplined bowling ensemble laid bare Australian frailty against the seaming ball before Lahiru Thirimanne anchored a comfortable chase on a tacky pitch in the second match of the series at Adelaide Oval. The visitors lost Upul Tharanga in the first over of their chase but were largely untroubled thereafter, as the surface eased after earlier offering helpful seam movement for Sri Lanka's bowlers. Thirimanne reached a deserved century by cutting Xavier Doherty backward of point for the winning runs with eight wickets and 59 balls to spare, having been accompanied for much of the pursuit by an uncharacteristically reserved Tillakaratne Dilshan. Particular praise was also due to Nuwan Kulasekara and Angelo Mathews, who took the new balls and set Australia on the defensive by moving the ball just enough through the air and off the seam, while keeping the runs down."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. Mendis to Finch, OUT outside edge! Mendis strikes in his first over of his one-day comeback, it was bowled off the back of the hand, Finch was prodding forward, bounced a bit more and took the edge, no doubts about that Mendis to Khawaja, 1 wide that was too wide of the leg stump and he leaves it alone Mendis to Hughes, 1 wide fires that down the leg side and he doesn't offer a shot Starc to Upul Tharanga, 1 wide drifts down the leg side and wide called McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT the captain goes! Good delivery by McKay, lands on a good length outside off, Jayawardene pokes his bat out and the edge goes to Finch at first slip Johnson to Dilshan, 1 wide short ball down the leg side and he shoulders arms Hussey to Dilshan, 1 bye beats him! Slower through the air from Hussey, drives and misses Starc to Chandimal, 1 wide strays too wide down the leg side Doherty to Jeevan Mendis, SIX runs take that! Tossed up on middle and leg and Mendis chips down the track and lofts him about 15 rows over deep midwicket Johnson to Jeevan Mendis, OUT soft dismissal! Length ball skids through and Mendis tries to launch it over the bowler's head, not in control and he miscues it to mid-off, easy catch to Bailey McKay to Chandimal, OUT superb catch by Haddin! McKay pitched it up and bowled it wide of the off stump getting him to drive, thick outside edge and Haddin timed his dive to his right very well and plucked it one-handed. He nonchalantly Johnson to Kulasekara, 1 leg bye awkwardly fends off a short ball on the body, scampers the single McKay to Kulasekara, 1 wide another short one and another attempted hook, passes the glove and Haddin goes through with the appeal, late call for a wide by Reiffel McKay to Kulasekara, 1 wide drifts wide down the leg side and he tries to work it away McKay to Kulasekara, 1 wide he drifts wide down the leg side and another wide McKay to Mendis, OUT it's all over, at the stroke of the 40th over! Catching practice for Haddin, Mendis gets a length ball which he presumably wants to dab to third man, only managed a thick edge, Haddin would have caught that with his It can't be too bad a team when you have the likes of Hughes, Khawaja and Finch in probably the form of his life. He didn't perform today but his time will come. Player of the match is Phillip Hughes, AUS","Australia 5 for 305 (Hughes 112, Bailey 89, Hussey 60*) beat Sri Lanka 198 (Chandimal 73, Dilshan 51, McKay 4-33) by 107 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Phillip Hughes and George Bailey had a 140-run stand for the third wicket Getty Images B-team, hey? An Australian outfit led by George Bailey in his 14th ODI and featuring three debutants did what sides captained by Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Shane Watson have not managed to do in the past three one-day international encounters against Sri Lanka at the MCG: win. One of those first-gamers, Phillip Hughes, became the first Australian to score a century on ODI debut and Bailey fell just short of a captain's hundred to drive Australia to 5 for 305, before a series of run-outs derailed Sri Lanka's chase. In the end, the Australians - without Clarke, Watson, David Warner, Michael Hussey and Matthew Wade - cruised to victory by 107 runs. If they can do something similar in the second match in Adelaide on Sunday, it might be hard for the selectors to make too many changes. But whatever happens, what can't be altered is the strong performance Bailey's side put up at the MCG."
"Starc to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT and the bowling change does the trick! Comes over the wicket, lands it outside off, Mahela goes forward and across to drive and gets a thick outside edge at waist height to Clarke at first slip, they check for the no-ball and Starc's heel was just behind the popping crease before he dragged it forward, lega Starc to Thirimanne, 1 wide hits the deck even harder and it's another bouncer, he is penalised for it Siddle to Thilan Samaraweera, OUT trapped in front and Samaraweera was walking, as it so appeared! Siddle gets this one to nip back in off the pitch, Samaraweera was trapped on the back foot, hit plumb in front of middle and leg as he tried to turn it to the on side Starc to Angelo Mathews, OUT Hussey takes his second catch! Once again Starc doesn't take long to strike in a new spell, it was angled across the right-hander, Mathews was forward and across and the edge traveled to Hussey at second slip, in fact he took his eyes off the ball slightly before taking it Lyon to Thirimanne, OUT soft dismissal, good catch and Thirimanne has to go for 91! Lyon tossed it up from round the wicket, outside off, Thirimanne couldn't resist going for the uppish driver over cover, he miscued it towards cover point, Warner ran to his right from cover and timed his dive well and took the catch Siddle to Prasad, OUT another poor shot leads to a wicket! This was short on the off stump, Prasad tries to backhand that one over mid-on presumably, goes back at the crease and completely mistimes it, it travels low to mid-on where Starc takes a good low catch falling forward Starc to Chandimal, OUT Yorker! Troubles the best of them, Starc's making it a habit striking early in a spell, this was angled in beautifully from the off stump, lands on the blockhole, Chandimal wasn't quick enough to get his bat down, crashes between middle and leg Bird to Herath, OUT and that's the end of Herath, he has gone for a big heave and skied the ball to mid-off, Peter Siddle takes a comfortable catch. This could end quickly now for Sri Lanka Bird to Lakmal, OUT there's the breakthrough at last, Bird finally draws an edge and this one is taken by Michael Hussey at second slip moving to his right. Bird finishes with four wickets and the late finish means Australia won't have to bat tonight Dilshan to Clarke, 1 leg bye strays on the pads and he knocks it away to the leg side off the pads Prasad to Wade, 1 wide hits the deck harder and he is penalised for the bouncer Prasad to Clarke, 1 wide bowls him a bouncer and it's called a wide, marginal call Pradeep to Wade, (no ball) appeal for a caught behind and he is given not out and Mahela calls for the review. But Pradeep overstepped the crease and Wade survives anyway. No clear evidence of an edge anyway. SL don't lose a review because he overstepped Pradeep to Siddle, 4 leg byes poor delivery, he strays on the pads and he flicks it away wide of the keeper to fine leg, given leg byes but replays showed it clipped his glove first And Australia have declared. Australia have a lead of 138. SL will be disappointed they couldn't roll them over this morning for less. Now they will bat out about 15 minutes till lunch. Innings Start Australia are out. Nope, no Hussey! Starts off with spin","Australia 9 for 432 dec and 5 for 141 (Cowan 36, Herath 3-45) beat Sri Lanka 294 and 278 (Karunaratne 85, Chandimal 62*, Jayawardene 60, Johnson 3-34, Bird 3-76) by 5 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Michael Hussey was warmly welcomed by the Sydney crowd Getty Images Michael Hussey is one of cricket's finest finishers, so it was only fitting that he ended his international career by steering Australia to victory and a series clean-sweep over Sri Lanka. Despite the best efforts of his partner Mitchell Johnson to dead-bat the ball with one run needed, Hussey was not able to hit the winning run, instead sprinting through for a single as the ball ran off Johnson's thick edge and away to point off Rangana Herath. To Hussey, it barely mattered. The win - the 48th of his Test career - was what meant everything. And in a small chase of 141, he had done an important job of guiding Australia through some late jitters to complete a five-wicket victory."
"Jadeja to Starc, OUT Ashwin won't get 10. Natural variation from Jadeja. Starc defends playing for turn, but this length ball goes straight on, beats the outside edge, and hits the off stump Jadeja to Clarke, OUT Clarke has finally got out. And the wicket comes - as Dhoni has been expecting for hours - through a mistake by the batsman. Clarke skips down the track, is not close to the pitch of the ball, but goes ahead with an attempt to loft it straight down the ground. The ball turns, and hits the outside half of the bat, and Clarke holes out to long-off Harbhajan to Siddle, OUT Bhajji finally gets a wicket in his 100th Test. Finally Sehwag takes a catch. He has worked Siddle out well. After that slow doosra, he bowls full and fast, and Siddle guides this to slip. Sehwag is awake, and Harbhajan has a wicket, who looks towards the skies in sheer relief Sharma to Lyon, 1 bye sharp movement back in from outside off, beats the in side edge, then swings more after passing the stumps. Dhoni allows a bye Ashwin to Lyon, OUT finally Dharmasena raises his finger. Don't think he was left with an option. Offbreak, middle and leg, swept away, gets an edge fine, and Kohli takes a superb catch to his right at backward short leg. Ashwin's best figures in first-class cricket Check out our India v Australia Caption Contest on Facebook - a really special prize is up for grabs 11.45am That's end of the innings, and also lunch. Australia will be the happier side with this total. The wicket has started to play the tricks, but do Australia have the bowlers suited to capitalising on them? We will find out soon. I, for one, won't rule out Starc, Pattinson and Siddle on any surface. We will be back by around 12.20pm. Play resumes at 12.25pm Lyon is out of the attack. Siddle comes back. I just hope Pattinson is not injured. He has bowled three overs and has taken two wickets Starc to Tendulkar, 1 leg bye short of a length, angling in, Tendulkar is a bit too early to turn the bat face, and is hit on the pad. Luckily for him, it is bouncing too high Pattinson to Tendulkar, 1 wide loopy bouncer, Tendulkar standing on the shoulders of Tendulkar wouldn't have been able to reach it Pattinson to Dhoni, 4 byes big-time wide down the leg side, and swinging further away, and despite Wade's dive, it has gone for four byes. A bit harsh on him. This should be wides Lyon to Tendulkar, OUT oh Lyon, what a beauty. That's a lovely offspinner's dismissal. They dream of these, and when you do this to Tendulkar in a Test in Chennai, oh boy what a feeling. Tossed up outside off, exactly in that rough, Tendulkar drives away from the body, and it spins sharply through the gate. Reminiscent of the way Vaughan got him. This one might even have taken the inside edge Pattinson to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni is out finally. Pattinson gets five. He has bowled his heart out, and has fittingly ended a superb innings from the opposition captain. Dhoni falls on 224, eight short of the highest score by a wicketkeeper. This is a bouncer, on middle and leg, Dhoni gets inside the line to hook, but ends up gloving it through to Wade. The sparse crowd, and the full dressing room stan Lyon to Kohli, SIX runs Kohli has been tested, but he is alert to the rare loose ball. Lyon bowls a long hop, and he ricks back to pull it over midwicket. You need to capitalise on these when the scoring opportunities are few and far between Pattinson to Bhuvneshwar, 1 wide bouncer down the leg side, and too high too 10.29am India have a lead of 192. That's huge. This pitch looks like a clay court. Indian spinners will be falling over each other to have a go. Can Australia frustrate them for long enough to hang in for a draw? We will start finding out in 10 minutes Innings Start Sehwag seems to have forgotten his glasses. He goes back and gets them. Vijay waits for him. And now the two walk out. Australia's chance to deal a psychological blow or two. Especially against the openers. An opportunity for the Indian openers to otherwise, and get this with all wickets in hand. Just imagine this is Ranji, and you are fighting for a bonus point","India 572 (Dhoni 224, Pattinson 5-96) and 50 for 2 beat Australia 380 (Clarke 130, Ashwin 7-103) and 241 (Henriques 81*, Ashwin 5-95, Jadeja 3-72) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Virender Sehwag had his second failure of the match when he was dismissed for 19 by Nathan Lyon BCCI An Indian victory that seemed imminent minutes after tea on day four was eventually completed by Sachin Tendulkar, 40 minutes before lunch on day five. Australia's resistance over that period arrived too late to change the result, but in it may be found the clues to a tighter contest when the second match begins in Hyderabad on Saturday. MS Dhoni, R Ashwin, Virat Kohli and Tendulkar were the pivotal contributors to India's 1-0 series lead, showing greater discipline and awareness of the sort of cricket best played on the MA Chidambaram Stadium's clay court. Save for Michael Clarke's first-day century and James Pattinson's fiery pace, it was not until Moises Henriques stood up with the bat in the second innings that the tourists showed evidence of catching up. A target of only 50 to win was reached with the help of some Tendulkar fireworks - towering sixes from his first two deliveries against Nathan Lyon - but Pattinson again bowled well to the openers and Lyon showed far greater consistency of line and control of length than he had managed while being taken for 3 for 215 in the first innings."

It was short and looking to pull, it was a top edge that cleared the keeper and everyone else and cleared the rope Faulkner to Pollard, OUT good catch by Marsh! It was a high full toss, Pollard tries to launch it down the ground, top edge and it swirls towards long-on, Marsh keeps his eye on it and catches it falling back, Pollard checks with the umpire if it was a Faulkner to Bravo, OUT two for the over! This was drifting on the pads and Bravo shuffled and tried to work it to the on side, moved too much the ball clipped the leg stump Faulkner to Sammy, SIX runs second tier! Biggest hit so far, he uses the crease and lofts a pitched up delivery and sends it over the second tier at wide long-on, tremendous bat speed Faulkner to Sammy, 1 wide this was too short outside off and he's penalised for the bouncer Faulkner to Sammy, SIX runs he's biffing em!

Bailey was down on his knee to sweep and he gets a top edge towards short square leg, Deonarine times his dive well and takes the catch Deonarine to Haddin, SIX runs add another 6! Could this be the over? Tossed up on middle and leg and he gets on his knee and slogs him clean down to deep midwicket, a few rows back Pollard to Haddin, OUT Russell takes a very sharp catch and celebrates with the Gangnam Style! It was looped up on the off stump, Haddin made room and bashed it flat, it really rocketed off the bat and Russell was alert at long-off, got across to the r Pollard to Faulkner, OUT Sammy takes it! This was slower and fuller, Faulkner tries to launch it over long-on, it dips towards Sammy who takes it well in front of the rope, starts off the Gangnam but changes his mind Best to McKay, 1 bye down the leg side and nearly clips the pads as he tries to clip it away So much for Coulter-Nile's prediction at the halfway mark... Player of the match is Kieron Pollard, WI","West Indies 6 for 191 (Charles 57, Faulkner 3-28) beat Australia 8 for 164 (Voges 51, Pollard 3-30, Narine 2-19) by 27 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Johnson Charles was in fine form once again Getty Images Three days ago, Johnson Charles scored his first international hundred but couldn't stop an Australian victory. This time, a brisk Charles half-century was enough to set West Indies on the way to their first win over Australia in Australia in any format for 16 years, as they showed why they are the reigning Twenty20 world champions. Australia might have swept the ODIs 5-0, but West Indies will at least fly home on a happier note. They had not beaten Australia in this country since the Perth Test in February 1997. The only man from that contest involved in this drought-breaking match was Paul Reiffel, then a fast bowler, now an umpire."

That was just as quick as the previous ball, made himself room and lofted him downtown flat over long-on McKay to Charles, 1 wide this was dug in short down the leg side, Charles tries to pull but wide called McKay to Charles, 1 wide bowls that wide outside the off stump and he doesn't offer a shot McKay to Bravo, 1 leg bye good length on the pads and he works it away down to fine leg Doherty to Charles, 1 leg bye slower through the air and he clips it away off his pads to short fine leg Faulkner to Bravo, 1 wide bangs in the bouncer this time but it's down the leg side and he's penalised for it Johnson to Bravo, SIX runs and follows that up with a six! All happening here, it was pitched up and he went forward and lofted it over long-off Doherty to Thomas, 1 leg bye shuffles and knocks it off his pads down to short fine leg McKay to Pollard, 1 wide McKay strays down the leg side and wide called, he should be careful since the fine leg is up Faulkner to Roach, 1 bye this one skidded through and beat the bat as he tried to cut, Haddin fails to gather it McKay to Sammy, SIX runs Sammy's not done yet! It was a full delivery wide outside off, he made room and smashed that over long-off West Indies won't be on that plane back home yet. There's the T20 at the Gabba on Wednesday. Their last chance to salvage a win in what's been a miserable tour. Do join us for that. Thanks for your company today. Cheers! Player of the match is Adam Voges, AUS","Australia 5 for 274 (Voges 112*) beat West Indies 257 (Charles 100, Johnson 3-50, McKay 3-52) by 17 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Adam Voges scored his first international century Getty Images Johnson Charles was seven years old last time West Indies beat Australia in an ODI in Australia. For much of the second half of this game, it appeared that Charles was going to ride his luck and steer West Indies to victory but not even his maiden century could end 16 years of Australian dominance at home. Under the captaincy of Shane Watson and without several of their best players, Australia completed a 5-0 clean-sweep thanks largely to Adam Voges and his first international hundred. Voges scored an unbeaten 112 that rescued Australia from a shaky start after they were sent in by Darren Sammy and they were able to post 5 for 274, a very competitive total given the absence of the injured Michael Clarke, David Warner and George Bailey, as well as Matthew Wade and Glenn Maxwell, who have already flown to India for the Test series. In reply, West Indies had their ups and downs but with Charles and Kieron Pollard at the crease they remained firmly in the contest."
"Toss: West Indies have won the toss and they will bat first. Australia have brought in Adam Voges in place of George Bailey (hamstring injury) and Ben Cutting replaces Mitchell Starc. West Indies have three changes - Johnson Charles, Deonarine and El Tino come in for Gayle, Sarwan and Roach. Johnson to Charles, 1 wide short of length delivery, but that is way down the leg side Johnson to Charles, OUT he makes up for Starc's absence by bowling it full on the off stump. Johnson gets a taste of what's it like to face the inswinger's at that pace. he is too late, the ball sneaks in and takes the offstump out of the ground, sends it few meters behind ... Lovely delivery Johnson to Bravo, 1 wide super quick, but it's down the leg side, Wade somehow manages to stop that Johnson to Bravo, OUT caught at second slip! Is anyone missing Starc now? not me. It was quick short ball on the body, wobbles a bit too and that is enough to induce a faulty defence from the batsman. He tries to fend it to the leg side but gets a leading edge which balloons in front of the second slip, the fielder dives Maxwell to Bravo, OUT hits him on the pad as Bravo comes forward in his defence.. They are going for a review. It just spun in a bit and hit the batsman on the knee-roll. He was way forward. It has turned back from outside off to hit the top of off. Successful review this one.. The fall continues.. Cutting to Deonarine, OUT caught at second slip! Deonarine has been pushing at all deliveries since he arrived and this time, he tries to play a forceful shot at an angled delivery, gets a nice thick healthy edge that flies to the second slip at a good height. What a disaster. I just noticed they are not even fifty at th Cutting to Thomas, OUT oh that doesn't carry to the second slip! Or has it, they are asking the umpires. It was short of length outside off, the batsman pushes it off the back foot and gets a healthy edge to second slip, where Finch scoops it up. No one is really excited about it and the umpires are having a long debate. Maxwell to Sammy, 1 wide turns down the leg side, called a wide Johnson to Sammy, 1 wide wide and very full outside off stump Cutting to Sammy, OUT caught at first slip! Another shot in the arm for the Aussies. It was length delivery outside off stump and bounced more than what Sammy anticipated, it takes a good thick edge and flies to Clarke at first slip. McKay to Russell, SIX runs Finch goes for the catch at deep midwicket, but ends up parrying it over the line. It was smashed off a slower ball and Finch got both hands to it Faulkner to Russell, OUT caught at long off! Russell does what he knows best, he gives this one a good thwack, but doesn't get the ball of the middle at all, it hangs in the air for a while and comes down at long-off where Maxwell gobbles it up easily. Faulkner to Narine, 1 wide short delivery to the batsman, who ducks under it easily, but this one has gone way over to be called a wide Cutting to Narine, 1 wide short delivery, goes way over the batsman's head who was in no position to play that one anyway McKay to Narine, OUT he comes forward to defend, but the length ball takes the outside edge and goes to the keeper. A good hand played by Narine in a very very useful partnership for West Indies. Russell to Watson, 1 leg bye angled into the batsman, but he is not able to get behind this one, hit him on the pads and they take another one Best to Watson, 1 wide another quicker delivery, but this one goes down the leg side Narine to Finch, OUT quicker delivery, that goes on with just enough spin to beat the bat. Finch was playing across the line and was not really forward. The umpire gives him out but Finch asks for a review (Why?). There is not inside edge, and the ball goes on to hit the top of leg, so the umpire's decision stays.. First Bravo to Hughes, 1 wide a bouncer to the left-hander, Hughes has no problems with that one, ducks under it and it's too high Best to Watson, OUT that is all over! El Tinoooooooooooo strikes..Late in the day. That was a quick short delivery on the body, gets only chest high and follows Watson, who is unable to get his bat out of the way and it goes straight to the keeper, who doesn't make any mistake this time. Tino passes a sermon to Watson as Russell to Wade, SIX runs whooaa!! Sends it over the backward square leg boundary for a first-ball six. What a hit. It was short and on the body, he wound up and cracks a vicious pull to send this flat.. That made a good sound .. For West Indies, Kieron Pollard, who is also the man of the match, played an amazing innings to prop up the score to 220 but there wasn't much from the others. Mitchell Johnson bowled with fire up front and did most of the damage earlier. There is just one more game to go - in Melbourne - and the home side would hope for a clea Australia won by 5 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) Player of the match is Kieron Pollard, WI","Australia 5 for 221 (Watson 76) beat West Indies 220 (Pollard 109*, Johnson 3-36, Cutting 3-45) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The West Indies innings was a salvage operation for Kieron Pollard, but it wasn't enough to prevent another defeat AFP Shane Watson's life without bowling is so far turning out to be a life without worries - for him, and for Australia. Another fluent innings from Watson set the hosts on the path to a leisurely five-wicket victory over the West Indies at the SCG, thus extending the series ledger to 4-0 in favour of Michael Clarke's team as they begin to be fragmented by departures for the imminent tour of India. Forming important early stands with Aaron Finch and Phillip Hughes, Watson showed there was little bowling joy to be found in a pitch on which the visitors earlier slipped to 6 for 55. Kieron Pollard's admirable rearguard had dragged the visitors' tally to 220 and at least ensured the lights would be required before 18,161 spectators watched Australia strolling home with 31 balls to spare. Watson played handsome strokes all around the ground, while also absorbing a teasing spell from Sunil Narine, but was given a major helping of good fortune on 32 when wicketkeeper Devon Thomas dropped the sort of chance any gloveman would have been embarrassed to turf."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. As expected, Watson is back in the team and he has replaced Khawaja. West Indies have also made one change - Andre Russell gets his first game; he replaces the impressive Jason Holder. Sammy to Finch, OUT oh no! Finch is not able to answer his detractors as he falls early again. It was a length ball outside off and he tries to play it towards third man - he has been doing it all morning - but it was too close. the ball kisses the edge and disappears in Thomas' gloves. Darren Sammy and Ben K worked him out.. Roach to Watson, OUT caught at deep backward square leg! He wasn't really going to stop after his hundred. It was a short and fast delivery on the body, Watson goes for a hook shot but it goes straight to Pollard at the boundary.. Russell to Hughes, SIX runs and here comes the big shot, length ball on the middle, he gives it mighty thwack and sends it soaring over deep midwicket boundary into the crowd Pollard to Clarke, OUT oh how well is that done! Good juggling act. Ok, so it was a low full-toss outside off, Clarke went for a heave back straight back towards the bowler but gets a toe-end to that shot. Polly jumps up assuming the ball is coming at super sonic speeds towards him, but it was a mistimed shot, comes much slower. Polly gets a palm to it and luckily for him, it falls forward and he completes a good catch Narine to Maxwell, OUT caught at deep square leg! Excellente catch!! Wow! Pollard flies in from nowhere and plucks a sure shot six with one hand. It was slog swept very hard and it was going flat and fast towards the boundary. But Pollard times his leap superbly and sticks his hand out, when he comes down, he's got the ball in his hand.. super catch..unbelievable.. Narine to Bailey, OUT caught at deep midwicket! And another catch by Pollard. Another well-timed leap at the boundary. Bailey charged out of the crease and Narine pulled his length back, but the batsman goes for the pull anyway and gets a lot of bat on it. But no one is surprised as Polly pulls off another stunner Bravo to Faulkner, OUT he backs away to the leg side, gives it a mighty heave but he is nowhere near the ball. It is a straight one which goes right through him and hits the leg stump We are back now. Devon Thomas comes out with Powell. Gayle will come later as he has got some side strain. Clarke to Bravo, 1 wide he goes down the leg side and is called a wide Maxwell to Bravo, 1 wide pushes it down the leg side, called a wide Starc to Bravo, 1 leg bye full and on the pads, Darren misses the flick again. It hits the pads and goes towards point Johnson to Russell, 1 wide bowls it full and it goes down the leg side. Wade doesn't collect cleanly McKay to Sammy, 1 leg bye quick short of length delivery on the middle and leg line, the batsman tries to pull, but gets hit on the thigh pad Australia have finished the job with precision. They put up a strong score, thanks to Shane Watson and Phil Hughes with the bat, and then their bowlers kept chipping away with the wickets. James Faulkner picked up four wickets - all four bowled. The pitch at Manuka Oval was supposed to give the West Indies team a respite after Perth, but they gave a few too many earlier. The Bravos kept them in the game for a while, but once they were out, ther They gave hope of a comeback, but it wasn't to be today. Thanks for all the comments and feedback, apologies as we get to publish only a handful. Dan Brettig's match-report is being updated as I type. This is Devashish Fuloria signing off, ciao ciao. Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 7 for 329 (Watson 122, Hughes 86) beat West Indies 290 (Darren Bravo 86, Dwayne Bravo 51, Faulkner 4-48) by 39 runs Live scorecard and ball by ball details Shane Watson and Phillip Hughes prospered, though in contrasting styles Getty Images A Shane Watson century, an Australian victory. In the minds of the coach Mickey Arthur and the captain Michael Clarke, such a scenario should occur far more often, and Watson could scarcely have made a better start to life as a non-bowling batsman with a fluent innings to set the platform for a total that proved beyond West Indies in the third ODI at a resplendent Manuka Oval. The 39-run victory sealed the series for the hosts, but they were as satisfied by the fact that minus the distraction of allround duties Watson was able to sail to three figures on an amiable pitch. His free-scoring was followed up by a contrasting innings from Phillip Hughes, scratchy early but sublime later, while George Bailey clattered 44 from a mere 22 balls before leaving the field with a tight hamstring in the evening. Kieron Pollard had leapt outrageously to catch Glenn Maxwell, and the visiting batsmen were set a similarly high mark to win."
"10.50 am: West Indies have won the toss and they will field first. Darren Sammy has decided to field an unchanged XI for today's game. Could they do what Australia did to them two days back? Australia are also going with the same team. Holder to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball on the pads, he tries to flick it but misses, gets hit on the pads and the ball rolls down to fine leg Roach to Khawaja, OUT caught at square leg! Oh wow! That is a double-handed ripper. It was a length ball on the middle stump and Khawaja went for a flick, he timed it really well and I thought it was heading towards the boundary, but Powell at square-leg dives full length to his right, catches the Roach to Finch, 1 leg bye 147 ks, length ball on the pads, too quick for the batsman as he goes for the flick, but gets hit on the pads Holder to Finch, OUT caught at cover! One handed! Another catch plucked from nowhere. Finch went back to the short of length delivery outside off and smashed it, reallly smashed it. The only thing was that he hit in the air, and Bravo pulls off a super reflex catch. he went with two hands, but only Sammy to Hughes, OUT caught at midwicket! Oh no! There goes another one to a shot he would have thought was going towards the boundary. It was a hit-me delivery, short of length on the body, and Hughes goes for a pull. He had all the time at Sammy's pace, but he neither places it on the ground, or Bravo to Clarke, OUT Timber!!!! full delivery on the middle stump, a bit quicker from Bravo and Clarke looks to flick it through the leg side, but misses the ball completely and hears the clatter of the stumps behind him. That is a huge huge wicket. Bravo to Wade, 1 wide way down the leg side, exercise for the Umpire Sammy to Maxwell, OUT Chopped on! Oh the Aussies are crumbling here.. Shot, no shot, whatever. Maxwell, who score a fifty last innings, tries to pull his bat out of the way of a length delivery outside off, he is too late though. The ball hits the inside edge and drops on to his stumps. More joy f Sammy to Bailey, 1 wide wide delivery and the batsman has a wild swing at it, it goes past the outside edge Holder to Faulkner, 1 wide the bowler attempts a quick bouncer, but it easily bounces over the batsman Holder to Faulkner, 1 wide and another one, he gets a lot of bounce with those ones slammed hard on the deck. Goes way over Sammy to Faulkner, OUT caught at deep midwicket! So there is the wicket, they had to wait almost 20 overs for it. Faulkner makes room by moving outside leg and tries to flat-bat that to the stands at deep midwicket but it goes high, and is caught just inside the boundary by Powell, who didn't have Bravo to Bailey, SIX runs same ball, but this time he gets more on it, it goes over the rope and hits the ad-boards Bravo to Bailey, SIX runs length ball of off and Bravo is leaking has let the floodgates open here, this one goes over long on into the stands. Pollard can just watch.. Starc to Gayle, OUT that's it! It's all over, Gayle talks to Powell and thinks about a review, Powell says no chance. It was full and swinging away, it pitched around off and Gayle was hit right in front as he got squared-up a bit. Starc strikes in his first over.. Starc to Sarwan, OUT it is a gonner! He thought that the over had finished, but it hadn't. The ball is a perfect left-armer's delivery, pitches on length on the middle stump line, and curves back in. Sarwan had taken a step forward but wasn't able to take his foot out of the way, stuck in front and McKay to Bravo, 1 wide this time it is wide on the other side, McKay pushes it wide of off Starc to Powell, 1 wide loses direction as he pushes it down the leg side Starc to Bravo, OUT and the nostalgic picture is torn apart by a full delivery from Starc! He had been bowling a slightly shorter length this over, and now he pushes it full and on the stumps and Lara is late to bring his bat down, that was hitting middle of middle. Bravo reviews in hope, but that Starc to Powell, OUT another yorker, this time on the off and middle stump, Powell digs it out and Mitchell Starc catches it in return. Australians appeal for lbw as the ball might have hit the pad before the bat. the umpire says not out and they ask for a review. It hits the pads first..and it wa Starc to Thomas, OUT gets a short ball on off stump which goes past the outside edge as the batsman tries to sway away.. Everyone goes up on an appeal for caught behind. the umpire shakes his head, but they call for a review.. A brute of a delivery.. Hot-spot being tested. Was there some glove on Maxwell to Pollard, OUT caught at long on! The batting is crumbling! Pollard sees the flight and launches it into the skies, but it's not quite Wankhede so the ball doesn't go for a six, it comes down close the boundary where Finch takes a good catch. The wheels are coming off, it's official Maxwell to Sammy, OUT caught at long off! boom! He was not to the pitch of the delivery, but he went for the big shot nonetheless, and just scoops it over to the fielder at long-off. And just like that, Maxwell has three. What a day for him! Johnson to Holder, 1 wide a quick short ball as Holder starts moving down the leg side, but the ball goes further down the leg side and is called a wide Maxwell to Narine, SIX runs straight to the sight screen as Narine makes room and slogs it over the bowler's head for his first six Maxwell to Narine, SIX runs flatter delivery, makes do difference. He comes out and picks the ball of a length and goes over a leaping long-off fielder.. Johnson to Holder, 1 wide short ball down the leg side, everyone appeals for something, but it was way down the leg side Johnson to Holder, 1 wide comes up with the slower bouncer, but it goes over the batsman's head. Mitchell Johnson not very happy with the call. Johnson to Holder, 1 leg bye short ball on the body, Holder takes a hit on his stomach as he tries to glance that George Bailey is the man of the match. Not much of a presentation ceremony here, so we can't bring the comments from the captains. But there will be stories out later from press-conferences and I for one would like to read more about the decision-making process. It's the end of our coverage here and Bryd It has all ended in a bit of a haste really. The match was nicely set up by a counter-attacking stand between Powell and Dwayne Bravo - both getting half-centuries - but once Bravo was out, it opened the floodgates and the innings folded quickly. Mitchell Starc was superb again - he has two five-fors fro Player of the match is George Bailey, AUS","Australia 7 for 266 (Bailey 125*, Sammy 3-48) beat West Indies 212 (Powell 83, Starc 5-32, Maxwell 4-63) by 54 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details George Bailey finished unbeaten on 125 Getty Images On Friday, West Indies batted first and were bowled out at the WACA for 70. Two days later, Australia were sent in at the same ground and were 6 for 98. Another short day's play loomed. But George Bailey's maiden international century changed all of that and drove Australia to a scarcely believable 7 for 266 - after the match he said he had considered anything more than 200 a bonus - and Mitchell Starc's second consecutive five-wicket haul confirmed Australia's 54-run victory. The Perth fans who returned after seeing only 33."
"Toss: Darren Sammy has won the toss and has decided to bat. James Faulkner is making his debut today, he has been handed his ODI cap by the legend, Dennis Lillee. For West Indies, 21-year-old Jason Holder gets his first cap while Andre Russell has been left out. Kemar Roach is in too. McKay to Gayle, 1 wide short of length, but he loses direction and it goes wide outside off McKay to Powell, 1 wide this one swings away from the batsman, but this goes wide outside off and the umpire stretches his arms again Starc to Bravo, OUT is that caught! is that lbw! Whatever it is, it is another wicket! It is bat-pad to short leg. Starc keeps it there, full, fast and swinging on the middle stump, Dwayne, unlike Sarwan, takes a stride out to the ball, but it takes the inside edge, hits the pads and goes straight to short-leg fielder Starc to Pollard, OUT take this one then!! Full inswinging delivery outside off, Polly doesn't get too far forward and chops the ball back to the stumps. That's out twice in two balls in my book. Faulkner to Thomas, OUT caught at first slip! Success, triumph and fun for JF. A good start to his career and Thomas gives his wicket as a gift. It was short of length on off stump, angling across, and Thomas pokes at it, the edge flies comfortably to Clarke Faulkner to Sammy, 1 wide gets a wide delivery outside off Starc to Bravo, 4 byes short of length wide outside off, and that climbs from there and goes over the keeper's head.. Faulkner to Bravo, 1 wide down the leg side and it's called a wide Faulkner to Bravo, OUT caught my Mr. Clarke at you know where! As simple as you like. Length delivery on off stump, moves a touch away after pitching and Bravo plays that from the back foot when probably he should have been forward, the ball takes a proper edge and goes straight to first slip Johnson to Sammy, 1 leg bye short of length on the pads, hits the thigh pad and rolls towards backward square leg Johnson to Sammy, 1 leg bye length ball on middle and leg, swings back in, Sammy plays that to fine leg off the back foot McKay to Sammy, OUT caught at midwicket! Here comes the wicket. Short of length on off and middle, Sammy tries to flick it to the leg side , but the ball gets big on him and it takes a leading edge. It could have been McKay's catch, but he slips in his follow through, but there is ample time for the fielder at midwicket to jog in and swallow that one Johnson to Holder, 1 wide full and wide outside off, very wide, called a wide, rightly so McKay to Gayle, OUT caught at second slip! short of length on off stump, leaves the batsman and bounces a touch extra too, it takes the shoulder of the bat on it's way to the slip cordon and Finch dives across and catches it in front of the first slip fielder, it carried at a nice height this one, a super catch to send the big man back Starc to Powell, OUT caught at first slip! So that is what Starc has been setting Powell up for. It is another swinging delivery on off stump, but the length is pulled back just a bit, only just, and it takes the outside edge and goes straight to Michael Clarke for the easiest of slip catches. Two Down Starc to Sarwan, OUT hits middle and leg!!! Well well well, it is made me jump off my seat. It is full and swinging and fast and what not... Sarwan plays all over it and it goes through the gate and disarrays the nice lattice that the stumps are laid in. McKay to Narine, OUT No. 6 is not Narine's lucky number surely. After five attempts to get out, he succeeds off the sixth delivery and edges it through to the keeper. Starc to Holder, OUT No. 5 for Mister Starc! Length ball on middle and leg, swings in. Mr. Holder had moved outside leg stump to send this over the bowler's head, but he misses and loses the leg-stump. Holder to Finch, OUT Mr DRS has been called into service. It was short of length outside off, the batsman stays in the crease and tries to flay his bat at that, it takes an outside edge, seemingly so, (I heard a noise), but the umpire says no. Being reviewed...Yes, it is out. Although it didn't show up clearly on the hot-spot, the noise was too loud to ignore. Hold Game over within 10 overs. It is like Super Mario found a pipeline to take him close to the finish. Clarke walks out to shake hands along with his teammates. Maxwell came out and had some fun, he missed some, but he found the range with some unorthodox hitting. But the real star of the match was Mitch Starc. What a spell he bowled earlier today? If you haven't seen it, I That brings us to the end of our coverage. It has been a short and sweet day. I will be back on Sunday on comms, hoping for a better contest. Here is Dan Brettig's match-report. This is Devashish Fuloria signing off for the day. Ciao Australia won by 9 wickets (with 244 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Starc, AUS","Australia 1 for 71 (Maxwell 51*) beat West Indies 70 (Starc 5-20, McKay 3-10) by nine wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Starc swung the ball venomously late Getty Images Twenty years ago, almost to the day, Allan Border won the toss and batted before Curtly Ambrose obliterated Australia at the WACA ground in a spell of 7 for 1. Whirring the ball down with speed and fiendish late swing, Mitchell Starc paid homage by splintering the West Indies in a burst of 4 for 1 to set up a facile nine-wicket victory, achieved with all of 244 balls to spare. This time it was the touring captain Darren Sammy who paid a heavy price for choosing to bat first on a lively surface. Australia's pitiful 74 against Sri Lanka at the Gabba is no longer the lowest score of the limited-overs summer, it's now the West Indies total of 70 that was only reached after some late-order resistance following an earlier free-fall to 5 for 19. It was the most meagre total in all ODIs between the two countries, extras (17) providing the top score."
"12.30pm: South Africa win the toss and bat, they've included Janneman Malan and Kyle Verreynne for ODI debuts. Temba Bavuma is also fit to return, back in the No. 3 berth. Australia, meanwhile, have gone for something of a change-up in the middle order, with D'Arcy Short included as the spinning allrounder at No.7. That means no Ashton Agar, while Josh Hazlewood completes a Test-quali Starc to Malan, OUT full and swinging, 143kph/89mph, did that hit him on the boot?? Nigel Llong immediately turned away from the appeal, but Finch reviews, and this could be a sensational start for Australia! Definitely hit the bat, but it looks as if it crashed into the toe first - and this is stone dead, if so. Yes, boot first, that's plumb, golden duck for Malan on debut! Sma Cummins to Bavuma, 1 wide banged in down the leg side, Bavuma pulls and misses - but he'll have another chance, as it's called wide Cummins to Bavuma, 1 wide dug in again, 141kph/88mph but too much bounce this time, Bavuma ignores and SA get one more to the total Hazlewood to Verreynne, 1 wide short and leg side Cummins to Bavuma, OUT dragged on! Cummins strikes and this is already looking sticky for South Africa... Bavuma had been playing nicely but he's misjudged the bounce, maybe too close for the cut shot, too, and he cannons a thick bottom edge into his timbers. Off stump flat on its back, SA wobbling! Cummins to Verreynne, OUT banged in halfway down, pulled hard but straight to Mitch Marsh at square leg in the ring who takes a sharp catch! Verreynne misses out on a debut fifty, and Cummins has 100 ODI wickets! That was the dismissal Cummins was bowling for, short ball didn't quite get up and Marsh reacted quickly to snaffle the chance Marsh to Klaasen, SIX runs heaved over the leg side! Short-arm pick-up from Klaasen and he sends it soaring up and over the deep midwicket rope for a dismissive six! Cummins to Miller, OUT short ball, follows the batsman as he goes across... flapped to the keeper! Miller looking to get cute with the ramp but ends up inside-edging a simple catch to Carey! Been a bit of a struggle at the death, but still an important innings after the strife SA were in Cummins to Phehlukwayo, OUT moves across, exposing all three stumps... jabbed into the leg side and Klaasen wants on, Phehlukwayo is going to be short here! Brilliant from Cummins, fielding in his follow-through to his left, turning and throwing down the stumps with the batsman nowhere! Starc to Maharaj, OUT timber! Torpedoes off stump! Outta the ground and Maharaj is outta there... Having struck with his first ball, Starc has to wait until his 57th to pick up a second wicket with a classic yorker Ngidi to Finch, OUT no foot movement, flashes at it outside off stump, and feathers an edge behind! Finch departs early, throwing his hands at a back-of-a-length ball in the channel. Bit of extra bounce perhaps, struck the top edge as he look to flay a cross-batted shot through cover point, and the gleeful de Kock takes the catch! Ngidi to Warner, OUT chipped to the man in the covers, who takes a low catch and celebrates! Warner isn't going anywhere in a hurry... we're going upstairs, but the soft signal is out, which is so often important. Verreynne is the catcher... looks like he's jammed his fingers underneath the ball to me. These things always look worse in slow-motion. We're onto our second angle, w Phehlukwayo to Labuschagne, 1 wide another slower ball, the offcutter, lands this one just about on the tramlines, with Labuschagne a long way across before letting it go... but called wide Nortje to Smith, 1 leg bye slower ball, Smith shuffles around in the crease and deflects behind square on the leg side Nortje to Smith, OUT pinned on the pad, Nortje strikes and Smith is a goner! He asks Carey whether it's worth the review, but it looks fairly adjacent as Smudger trudges off! Length ball, decent bounce off the pitch. Smith was deep in the crease, looking to work through the leg side and pinned on the top of the pad. Might have been tight on height, but it's given, and that's a Player of the match is Heinrich Klaasen, SA","South Africa 291 for 7 (Klaasen 123*, Miller 64, Cummins 3-45) beat Australia 217 (Smith 76, Ngidi 3-30) by 74 runs Heinrich Klaasen's maiden ODI century, David Miller's second successive half-century in this format and a collectively impressive South African performance in the field, led by Lungi Ngidi, earned the hosts a big win in their opening ODI against Australia. After two blow-out batting performances in the T20Is, South Africa put partnerships together to post a competitive total and held their composure to keep a strong Australia line-up largely quiet. Steven Smith's 76 and his 84-run partnership with Marnus Labuschagne was Australia's best hope of chasing down 292, but it was not enough. They needed at least another stand of significance, as South Africa had on a surface where run-scoring was hard work. After slipping to 48 for 3, Klaasen and debutant Kyle Verreynne laid the foundation with a partnership of 78, before Klaasen and Miller built on it with a 149-run stand that allowed South Africa to aim for 300."
Innings Start,"Australians 321 for 5 decl and 263 for 4 (Khawaja 73, Haddin 52*, Hughes 50) beat Somerset 320 and 260 by six wickets Scorecard Phillip Hughes came in at No.3 and collected another valuable half-century to press his case for Ashes selection Getty Images Usman Khawaja, Phillip Hughes and Ed Cowan were all useful if not quite compelling on a day of sunshine and blue skies at Taunton as they duelled for places in the Australian batting order for the first Ashes Test. Each played fluently until the moment of his dismissal, but none turned their start into the sort of tally captain Michael Clarke and coach Darren Lehmann so desired from their charges. Still, a win is a win and as the first such result in a first-class match by an Australian team overseas since the third Test in Dominica in April 2012, it should not be sniffed at. Brad Haddin, the vice-captain, completed formalities with a second six in an innings that underlined how the tourists' goal of an outright result has never been in question."
"12.30 pm Australia have won the toss and they will field. There are no changes in their squad. Sri Lanka would have batted first anyway, says Angelo Mathews. They are also going in with an unchanged squad. Johnson to Perera, OUT another length ball on the leg stump, it hits the batsman as he is shuffling to play it towards the leg side, he gets hit in front of the leg stump, under the knee roll. The umpire takes some time and then raises his finger. KJP walks up to Dilshan to ask how that looked, but after a lengthy discussion, he is on his way. Johnson to Thirimanne, 4 byes short of length outside off, 146 kph, nasty delivery actually as it quickly rose on to the batsman, and it kept rising after Thiri got out of the way and went over the keeper's head Doherty to Dilshan, OUT caught at slip! What a catch by Watson, diving to his right, he picked this one low and one-handed! Doherty has been bowling well to Dilshan, he floats this one on the middle and leg line and gets it to turn just a touch, enough to beat batsman's whippy drive to the on side. Dilshan got a leading edge and Watson did the rest completing an excellent catch Johnson to Thirimanne, OUT short delivery outside off and he has pulled it straight to the fielder at midwicket. He was done in by the pace, 143 kph on that one, and was not in control of that shot. Also, that didn't bounce as high as anyone would have expected it to, Thiri took it just below chest high. A big breakthrough although Faulkner to Angelo Mathews, OUT That is bowled! For a few seconds no one had any idea about what was going on! It was a full length delivery and the batsman tried to whip it to the leg side, but it flicked the off stump on its way. The bowler was busy appealing for something (maybe a caught behind as there was a sound).. But it took a while for everyone to realise that the bails were off Johnson to Chandimal, OUT caught at mid-on. Tries the big whack again, but it was a slower delivery and although it looked like he had made good connection, he hadn't. That went just high and not long at all. Easily gobbled Kulasekara to Watson, OUT Kula has done it, last match it was with the bat, this time he has removed the dangerman Shane Watson with the ball, the ball angles in towards the stumps, Watson looks to dab it behind point, no footwork from Watson, he misses and the stumps are disturbed, the Sri Lankan fans at The Oval scream to make it known how big a moment this is Kulasekara to Maxwell, 1 wide way down the leg side Malinga to Voges, 1 wide he attempts a slower yorker again, but this one is wide down the leg side.. Herath to Wade, 2 leg byes loud loud appeal from Sanga as the batsman gets hit on the pads with a turning ball. Herath went over the wicket to the left-hander and got the ball to turn in from outside off. the batsman tried to tickle it to the leg side, but got hit on the pads. Sri Lanka call for a review, but that one just hit the batsman outside the line.. That would have hit the leg stump though Malinga to Voges, 5 wide that is a wild wild delivery! Sanga did his best, but that was still too wide. Five wides down the leg side Herath to Voges, 1 leg bye that was the left-hander's carrom ball and the batsman somehow managed to get a bat on it, he chopped it towards gully, but there was a direct hit at the non-striker's end. The umpire checks with the third umpire, but the batsman made it in time Herath to Voges, 1 leg bye he comes down the pitch, but Herath fires it on the pads. Voges manages to get some pad on it as had he missed it, he would have been a stumping candidate Dilshan to McKay, OUT he catches it this time! Absolute blinder by Dilshan to set off wild celebrations on the ground. The crowd has found its voice! It was another flatter delivery, shorter too and the batsman punched it back.. Dilshan was moving to his right, but the ball was hit to his left at a comfortable height, but he quickly changed direction and plucked it out from nowhere, it was drifting awa Sri Lankan supporters have found their voice after being put to an agonising wait by the last Australian pair. You wonder how crucial those wickets would have been now - Voges, Wade.. all throwing it away. The batting looked easy while the last pair were there. But Sri Lanka did well to hang in there. Kulasekara was amazing at the start of the innings, but there was no doubt the team was feeling the pinch tow This tournament keeps throwing up super matches and although this one was one-sided for most parts, it did come alive during the last hour.

A humbled Australia will start pondering the Ashes, and the state of disrepair their cricket has fallen into. Led by Mahela Jayawardene's silken unbeaten 84, Sri Lanka stuttered into a Champions Trophy semi-final against India by defeating a collective whose captain Michael Clarke watched disconsolately from The Oval balcony. Their slim chances of qualifying long since expired, Australia offered a last gasp via Clint McKay and Xavier Doherty, who added 41 for the final wicket. They were only separated by a blinding return catch from Tillakaratne Dilshan, whose exultant celebrations underlined the anxiety that had crept into a team who looked comfortable winners for most of the journey."
"10am: England win the toss and bat, there's no - *intake of breath* - Graeme Swann or Steven Finn in their XI. Swann pulled up with a sore back, with Finn left out on grounds of form. James Tredwell plays, as does Ravi Bopara, so England have already abandoned their five batsmen, five seamers masterplan in their first game of the tournament. 10.25am: The teams are strolling out for the anthems, a few sparklers having just gone off on the outfield. For apple types, at this juncture I'd like to point you in the direction of our new iPhone app, available from the iTunes store. Click, click, click. Johnson to Bell, 1 leg bye straighter, attempts to tuck off his pads but doesn't get any bat on it Watson to Cook, OUT he's done it, Watson makes the breakthrough, drawing Cook into a drive to be caught behind! Cook will feel he should have pinged that through the covers, it was a little wide, on a good length but they've not had any problems hitting on the up this morning - just a thin snick of bat and Cook trudges off having made another solid start McKay to Bell, 1 leg bye hit on the pad walking across his stumps, McKay lets out a lone gargle of an appeal - probably sliding down leg, though the replay shows it to have been a pretty close call, maybe tickling the top of the stump Marsh to Trott, 1 wide pushed down the leg side Starc to Trott, 1 wide a bouncer from Starc and it's too wide for the umpires Starc to Trott, OUT there's the breakthrough for Australia...Trott chases a wide ball outside off and gets a thin edge through to Wade Faulkner to Bell, OUT full and straight, Bell gets cleaned up so he won't have a hometown hundred...Bell suggests the ball didn't bounce as he expected, but I just think he missed a straight one McKay to Root, OUT back to back wickets, Root clips a delivery from off stump straight to midwicket...Australia now making some significant inroads Faulkner to Bopara, 1 leg bye stays over the wicket to the right-hander, pitched outside leg stump, tries to glance and gets a single fine off the pad Faulkner to Bopara, 1 leg bye pitched up around leg stump, Faulkner appeals as the ball thumps Bopara's pad and rolls into the off side ... and Australia decide to review the not-out decision. And the replays show it landed and struck outside the line, so that's a DRS fail for Australia McKay to Morgan, OUT shuffles across and bowled round his legs! McKay suckers him, maybe took the pace off a touch, Morgan going right across and exposing middle and leg stump, tried to wristily flick the ball over backward square leg, missed and the ball hit Faulkner to Buttler, OUT and Buttler's gone second ball, edging on to his stumps! Good areas from Faulkner, not quite wide or full enough for the drive and Buttler played away from his body, not much footwork, the ball cannoning back into his standing leg and then on to middle stump - the gunpowder has exploded in England's face! Starc to Bopara, SIX runs bosh, this one goes all the way, England's first six of the innings! A low full toss from Starc, Bopara clips it unfussily over deep midwicket, not much follow through but it flies low into the crowd Johnson to Bresnan, 1 wide sprayed very wide this time, as Bresnan stepped away - this one's called Broad to Warner, OUT fuller and driven at, edged to the keeper where Jos Buttler takes a fine catch to his left, no slip in place so that was an excellent grab diving with two hands. England have earned the wicket with their excellent start, a bit of width offered and Warner couldn't resist, flashing the hands at it without moving his feet and got a big n Bresnan to Watson, OUT full ball on the stumps, huge appeal for lbw, the ball cannons to gully where Cook takes the catch, either way Watson's out and he's caught, having got a thin edge onto the front pad that looped up to Cook. The delivery tailed in a little and Watson got outside the line and overbalanced Bresnan to Hughes, 1 wide bumper down the leg side, a very rare poor ball Broad to Bailey, 1 leg bye Broad is interested here, the ball again coming back at Bailey, he's hit above knee - quite leg side too - and they pick up an extra as Erasmus shakes his head Root to Hughes, OUT skids on, Hughes plays an ugly swipe across the line and is hit in front - Dharmasena gives it! That was a horrible shot from Hughes, he was getting tied down by Root's gentle offies, he tried to pull the ball off a length and was struck in front of middle and leg Bresnan to Voges, OUT Voges swings, misses and is bowled, Bresnan strikes for England! Looked like a little offcutter, rolling his fingers over the ball and it jinked back just enough off the pitch as Voges tried to hit down the ground, beat the bat on the inside and clattered into the top of middle and off stump Anderson to Marsh, OUT back of a length and pushed off the back foot straight to point and Anderson becomes the highest wicket-taker in one-day cricket for England. A loose stroke from Marsh outside off, it went at a good catchable height, very quickly but straight to Morgan who clung on at chest height with two hands, a sharp grab Anderson to Wade, OUT full and sliding past the outside edge, taken by the keeper and given out! Umpire Dharmasena nodded his head for the edge, they're going to check whether it carried to Buttler. There was no hesitation from Buttler who threw it up straight away, Hot Spot confirms a thin edge too, there was a nervy look behind by Wade as it went past Tredwell to Bailey, OUT around the wicket again, a few steps down the track, tries to take on long on but doesn't get anywhere near the proper connection and Joe Root takes the catch a very easy chance going a few yards to his left. It was a weak shot from Bailey and looped very comfortably to the fielder, Australia's last hope, if there was still hope, Bopara to Johnson, 1 leg bye full of length that swings back into the pads, brief cry for lbw but it's pitched outside leg stump, it cannons down to third man Bopara to Johnson, OUT full toss comes off high on the bat and loops to point. Oh dear Mitchell, a waist-high full toss, he's tried to slug it over the off side but is too late on the stroke and chipped up an easy catch to Morgan, they umpires had a quick check for the height of the delivery but concurred that it was fine For Australia, that was a very disappointing second innings. They started very quietly and then lost wickets, the worst of the worst. Thereafter only George Bailey got stuck in and made a score and by the time James Faulkner knocked it around down the order it was too late. It looked an out-of-form order lacking in quality. They have a real job on their hands t That's it from Edgbaston, England underway with a win and now have a few days to take stock, their next game comes on Thursday against Sri Lanka in Cardiff.

Player of the match is 368/7,"Australians 152 for 2 dec (Cowan 77*, Hatchett 2-28) and 366 for 5 dec (Smith 102*, Hughes 84, Cowan 66, Panesar 3-70) drew with Sussex 368 for 7 (Taylor 121*, Hamilton-Brown 73) Scorecard Ed Cowan made his second half-century of the match but is unlikely to win a Test recall at Old Trafford PA Photos Ed Cowan and James Taylor both enjoyed plenty of time in the middle on the final day in Hove, but only one of them has any real chance of playing in the third Test at Old Trafford next week. Taylor's unbeaten 121, scratchy though it was through its early stages, will give him some confidence as he travels to Manchester, where his fate will rest on the fitness of Kevin Pietersen. Cowan's 77 not out, compiled with the help of some buffet bowling late in the afternoon, will boost his tour tally but won't earn him a Test recall. As Australia's three-day game against Sussex petered out to its inevitable draw, Cowan and Matthew Wade (30 not out) put on an unbeaten 61-run partnership before the players shook hands and play was called off at 5.20pm, the earliest possible stumps time."
"Agar to Bell, (no ball) full on leg stump, rolled into midwicket this time, another no-ball for Agar Smith to Bell, OUT he's done it! Clarke's captaincy brings another wicket. It's a perfectly-pitched leg break which grips a fraction, finds the edge and carries low to Clarke at slip. What a bonus for Australia Smith to Bairstow, OUT and another! It's a full toss. Bairstow has just bunted it back to Smith. Christmas time for Smith and Australia. An awfully lazy dismissal from Bairstow, who drove a fraction early and Smith collected a low chance in his follow through Smith to Prior, OUT he's got three! What a spell for Australia. This one skidded through outside off, perhaps an attempted flipper, Prior went for the cut and gets a healthy top edge to Haddin Pattinson to Broad, OUT nicked to the keeper, the partnership is ended two short of fifty! Or is it? Broad doesn't walk, naturally, and has a wee conflab with Swann before deciding to review. This looks a bit hopeful, as there was a clear deviation on the way through... Though replays show it hit the flap of the pad, too. Hot Spot picks up a faint edge, though, so any more Broad controversy is quickly put to bed. England are all out Extraordinary that in this series, fifth-wicket pairs are the only ones that have been more productive than last-wicket partnerships. Here's a first-wicket pairing now, out walk Shane Watson and Chris Rogers for Australia's innings. James Anderson to begin. Bresnan to Watson, OUT Bresnan strikes! He has Watson lbw in the last over before lunch! Great ball, angled in and Watson moved across with the front pad and missed the ball, he's rapped right in front and Dharmasena gives it lbw. Watson chats for a while with Rogers and eventually makes the decision to review it. It's a poor decision because that was plumb. That's not how to use the review system Swann to Rogers, OUT what on earth has happened here? He's missed a full toss and been hit in front ... Erasmus raises a finger and England have another, though both batsman and bowler are shaking their heads! This is like the tactic of bowling a slow full toss on Brian Lara Cricket, though there was no intent on Swann's part. The ball slipped out of the hand and Rogers was slow to sight it, missed swinging across the line and got hi Swann to Khawaja, OUT Khawaja on the charge, he's hit this over the top... except it doesn't go over, it merely loops high off the toe and into the hands of KP at mid-off! He hasn't looked comfortable against Swann, surviving a drop at slip and defending somewhat anxiously in front of his pad, obviously decided he didn't want to die in a hole - so he perished in no-man's land instead Broad to Clarke, 1 wide bouncer, but it's too high to worry Clarke. It has worried umpire Dharmasena, though. He calls it wide. Anderson to Siddle, 1 wide hammers this into the deck, very short and it loops up well over the head of the batsman Innings Start Where's short leg?","England 361 (Bell 109, Bairstow 67, Harris 5-72) and 349 for 7 dec (Root 180, Bell 74, Siddle 3-65) beat Australia 128 (Swann 5-44) and 235 (Khawaja 54, Clarke 51, Swann 4-78) by 347 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Joe Root struck twice before tea adding to his memorable Test after his 180 AFP England secured a 2-0 lead in the Investec Ashes series as they completed an inevitable victory against Australia with relentless efficiency at the fag-end of the fourth day at Lord's. Australia were four balls away from taking the match into a fifth day, with England forced to take a second new ball, the extra half-hour and finally resorting to silent prayer before completing a 347-run win in the final over. Before an impatient Lord's crowd, eager to tick a box marked victory and head home, Australia's last pair, James Pattinson and Ryan Harris, established Australia's second highest stand of the innings - 43 runs awash with defiance - before the offspin of Graeme Swann trapped Pattinson lbw. At Trent Bridge, Ashton Agar and Phil Hughes registered the highest last-wicket partnership in Test history, and Australia's highest of the match. If only the batsmen could bat, they might make a fist of this series."
"Siddle to Root, OUT got him! The yorker does the job! Siddle gets his line right first ball from this end and the length is spot-on as well. Perhaps just a little hint of swing away and Root plays the wrong line, losing his off stump. Pattinson to Pietersen, 1 leg bye another easy single worked away behind square leg Siddle to Pietersen, OUT massive moment! Pietersen edges to second slip. Poor stroke. Playing away from his body again, it was a tighter line and shaped away, taking the edge to second slip Watson to Trott, 1 wide now it's a wide from Watson...Haddin earning his match fee today Pattinson to Trott, 1 wide and he starts with a massive wide, Haddin has every right to be getting a bit cheesed off now as he sent sprawling in front of first slip Siddle to Bell, OUT gone! Siddle strikes again in the first over of a spell! That's the third time this innings he's done that. Beautiful ball as well - angles in and then curves away from Bell, whose thick outside edge is taken by Watson at first slip. Pattinson to Broad, OUT all the good work undone. A bit dim from Broad who gets sucked in by a short ball which he top edges and Pattinson himself steadies under the catch on the on side Starc to Bairstow, OUT castled! Now it's reward for Starc. Full at off stump, Bairstow plays around it and the pole flies backwards. Wasn't quite a yorker, Bairstow closed the face as he aimed for the leg side. Had played straight for so much of his innings Starc to Finn, OUT first ball! Playing away from his body, edges through to Haddin. Finn reviews, thinking he has hit the ground, but replays quickly confirmed the nick. Pattinson to Swann, OUT that's a pretty fitting way to end the innings, Swann just prods a catch to cover from a short of a length delivery that he poked at with no intent at all Anderson to Clarke, OUT oh, bowled him, that's a peach of a delivery from Anderson! Unplayable covers it but that ball deserves a few more words in homage. It was on a length, curving in to pitch on off stump and then shape back past Clarke's outside edge as he groped forward, the ball kissing the top of off and gently dislodging the ba Anderson to Smith, 1 leg bye pushed towards leg stump, slightly short and the ball rolls square off the pad as Smith attempts a glance Anderson to Rogers, OUT speared in and hit in front, Rogers again pulled across his stumps ... up goes Dharmasena's finger but Rogers reviews! The angle was quite exaggerrated but this only has to be clipping and Hawk Eye suggests it was, Rogers has to drag himself away! Anderson's hard work in probing outside off pays off as Rogers fe Finn to Hughes, 4 leg byes at the hip again and Hughes tickles it down the leg side, just out of Prior's reach Anderson to Smith, OUT drives at this and edges it behind where did that come from? I think it moved a little and look a thin edge to Prior. From looking gun-barrel straight in the preceding overs this morning, this has just shaped a little away from Smith driving, admittedly a touch loosely outside off stump, he got a feather edge and Swann to Haddin, OUT turns in from outside off and Haddin is bowled big turn from two feet outside off to take the off stump as Haddin played back, big moment for England. That really went, the first ball that has really spun. Haddin was playing back to a just back of a length delivery, he looked to play perhaps a little too square and Anderson to Siddle, OUT back of a length just outside off, poked at edged and caught behind superb diving catch by Prior down to his right, fine grab. This time it left the right-hander a little, Siddle followed it outside off stump and Prior took off and claimed it very well a full stretch down to his right-hand side. Mastery of swing Anderson to Starc, OUT poked at again just outside off and another edge, this time straight to Prior and Anderson has five wickets, what an effort this morning from him. It was a full ball that ran across the left-hander who had a dabble at it outside off an got a feather edge. Starc didn't move his feet and it might have shaped away f Swann to Pattinson, OUT gone this time though, played forward and given out lbw struck on the front pad bang in front and the arm ball has done the trick. Pattinson has reviewed but it's in vain surely, yep that's smashing leg stump and there was no inside edge. Swann beating the inside edge this time and Pattinson is a goner Anderson to Agar, 1 leg bye Agar works a single away to the leg side and gives Hughes the strike Broad to Agar, OUT back of a length, pulled and...got him!! Oh no, caught in the deep. A miscue aiming to the midwicket boundary but didn't get it and Graeme Swann came in and took a low catch. He came so close, having played so well, but Agar has fallen just short of an historical century but it's still the highest Test score by a No. So England can breathe a huge sigh of relief to have finally ended the innings but goodness me what a turnaround from 117 for 9. No-one could have imagine something like that would happen for the final wicket but Phil Hughes and Ashton Agar have put Australia right in the game.

A last-wicket stand of 65 between Brad Haddin and James Pattinson took a wonderful match, against expectations, into the afternoon session before Anderson struck for the final time.

"Faulkner to Russell, OUT Innings Start","Australians 396 for 4 dec (Watson 109) and 341 for 5 dec (Clarke 124) drew with Worcestershire 284 (Compton 79) and 274 for 5 (Pardoe 57, Mitchell 54) Scorecard James Faulkner claimed the two Worcestershire wickets to fall before lunch Getty Images Australia's coach Darren Lehmann ran the drinks but the more enduring refreshment of wickets was elusive for the tourists as an obstinate Worcestershire dug in for the draw on the final day of the tour match at New Road. In a convivial atmosphere far removed from the tension likely to greet them on day one at Trent Bridge on Wednesday, Michael Clarke signalled he had given up attempts to bowl out the hosts by handing an over to Phillip Hughes that concluded with the shaking of hands. While the match was not won, Clarke's men will travel to Nottingham with a great deal more optimism than had existed in their ranks 11 days ago when the coach Mickey Arthur was sacked and replaced by Lehmann. All the batsmen have made some kind of score, and every bowler gained enough overs to feel ready for Test match duty, even if wickets have not always been easy to come by. Ryan Harris dismissed Alexei Kervezee and Worcestershire's captain Daryl Mitchell to claim the Australians' only wickets after lunch."
"5.30pm South Africa win the toss and field. No Steyn, no Bavuma. And a new opening partner for de Kock. Australia, as expected, are unchanged. Rabada to Finch, 1 wide speared down the leg side at 89pmh/143kph, given wide Pretorius to Finch, 1 wide full, down the leg side, called wide Pretorius to Warner, SIX runs slower ball, in the slot, picks it early, and slugs this miles over deep midwicket for a towering six! That's absolutely huge! And brings up Warner's fifty, from 30 balls Pretorius to Marsh, 1 wide slower ball again, Marsh gets over to the off side looking to hammer this over square leg but can't connect. Very harshly called wide Pretorius to Wade, SIX runs pace-on this time, length ball, Wade's eyes light up and he nails this over deep midwicket into the stands for six! Pretorius to Marsh, 1 wide and another one given wide! Hung outside off, pace-off again, looked to play through cover off the back foot but couldn't connect. Pretorius to Marsh, OUT slower ball, yet again, sliced very high in the air down towards short third man, and Shamsi takes the catch! Nearly swung himself off his feet, through the shot too quickly, and Shamsi holds on! Shamsi to Finch, 1 leg bye flat, down the leg side, skews out to square leg via de Kock's gloves. Given as a leg-bye, must have flicked the pad on the way through Shamsi to Finch, OUT Finch gets down and across looking to lap this over short fine leg, but Shamsi sees him coming. He's struck on the inner thigh, down on one knee, Shamsi belts out an appeal and it's given! Looked pretty adjacent, and Finch trudges off after an imperious 55. EDIT: Hawk-Eye confirms that would have smacked into the off stump, halfway up. Rabada to Marsh, SIX runs back of a length slower ball, swivel-pulled round the corner for six! Picked the length early, just helped it on its way over backward square Rabada to Carey, OUT timber this time! Offcutter on a length, Carey clears the front leg, is through the shot early, and it pings back the top of middle! No overstep this time, much to Rabada's relief Nortje to Smith, SIX runs full outside off, something of a half-volley, full extension of the arms... high in the air, but over du Plessis at long-on and into the crowd!

After choosing to field first, South Africa's five-man attack leaked runs in the first half of Australia's innings but it was their batting line-up that really let them down. Their chase was up before it had even properly begun when they reduced to 23 for 2 in the third over and 65 for 5 at the halfway stage.

Player of the match is Alex Hales, ENG","England 195 for 5 (Hales 94, Ahmed 3-25) beat Australia 168 for 9 (Warner 53, Dernbach 3-23) by 27 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Alex Hales again fell short of registering England's first Twenty20 hundred AFP Alex Hales cannot quite be termed an out-and-out Twenty20 specialist but it is possible that he is morphing into one. It is the short-form game that increasingly seems to consume him and it provided the stage for his most outstanding display in an in-and-out summer, his 94 the basis of a comfortable England victory in the second T20 international in Chester-le-Street. The prize of becoming England's first batsman to record a Twenty20 hundred still eludes Hales, however, although this innings did take him to the top of the ICC T20 batsmen rankings. He fell for 94 to the final ball of the penultimate over, as he dragged a low full toss from James Faulkner to long-on where David Warner plunged forward for a good catch. Hales is one of only two England batsmen to have made 99 in a T20 international, against West Indies on his home ground of Trent Bridge last year, the other being Luke Wright against Afghanistan in the World Twenty20 in Colombo, also last year."
"Phew. What a whirlwind 90 minutes that was. An amazing innings and most of it was from Aaron Finch who blasted the highest individual score in a T20 international, it was a blistering innings and he blew England away from the very first ball he faced - which went for six! Australia have the second-highest international T20 total and surprise, surprise, England will need a record Johnson to Root, SIX runs sliced, hard and into a gap behind square, free flow of the arms and Root has used Johnson's pace to skim the ball flat and all the way over the rope Watson to Root, 1 wide Root goes across, Watson drops short and slides down the leg side Watson to Root, 1 wide Root goes across, Watson drops short and slides down the leg side Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 248 for 6 (Finch 156) beat England 209 for 6 (Root 90*) by 39 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Aaron Finch blazed a trail from ball one AFP Whether Australia can produce young batsmen who are able to occupy the crease in Test cricket remains up for debate. That they can produce batsmen who give it an almighty thump there is no doubt. Aaron Finch, the 26-year-old Victorian, ransacked England's bowling with an eye-popping world record 156 as Australia secured their first victory in any format for 200 days. It was a ferocious display of hitting from Finch, who had six previous T20 caps, as he tore England's attack to shreds with a brutal display, in the process going well past Brendon McCullum's 123 as the highest score in an international Twenty20. Australia's eventual 248 for 6 was the second-highest total in a T20 international - and the highest in a match involving two Test nations - only Sri Lanka's 260 against Kenya was out of reach and for a while it appeared they may cross that landmark too."

The pitch still looks good to bat on, as the likes of Faulkner and Harris showed, but with the new ball Faulkner to Prior, OUT frees the arms again, hitting across the line and gets a top edge, over the bowler, to the left of mid-on, Mitchell Starc, who takes a brilliant diving catch!

Then, with England needing 21 runs from four overs with six wickets in hand, a capacity crowd in a state of high excitement and Clarke no longer fancying a game of cricket quite as much anymore, the umpires took out their light meters and they all walked off.

As happened 32 years ago, Australia tossed away day upon day of diligent cricket with a crowded hour or so of batting calamity, against bowling of high quality from an England team that had looked momentarily bereft of inspiration. Where in 1981 Bob Willis and Ian Botham had rained blows on their antipodean rivals, this time it was Stuart Broad, aided by a critical cameo from Tim Bresnan. Back then, England had been marshalled expertly by Mike Brearley; now it was Alastair Cook who pulled the right rein by replacing Graeme Swann with Bresnan when Australia were 167 for 2 and hurtling towards 299 to win. What followed was a cavalcade of wickets that undid nine days' worth of hard graft from an Australia team straining to break a sequence of ineptitude."
"Bresnan to Starc, 1 wide goes for the slower-ball bouncer but it loops so high that it's called wide David Warner, who took that catch, then raced off the field. Maybe he will open?

The retention of the urn arrived formally via the underwhelming circumstances of an announcement that play had been abandoned at 4.39pm local time, due to a solid belt of rain that could delay its arrival no further than three balls into the afternoon session. By that time England had lurched to 37 for 3, Ian Bell stung on the thumb by a prancing delivery from Peter Siddle that rather summed up the danger posed by a committed and skilful Australian attack, who have grown increasingly confident in their ability to snip the top off their opponents' batting. Confounded by the rain in Manchester, they will look back ruefully on the failure of Australia's batsmen to provide them with anything to bowl to at Trent Bridge and Lord's, where England established their decisive advantage."
"1.30pm: Disappointingly (but not entirely unexpectedly) a coastal squall has just swept in off the Solent, forcing the groundstaff to wheel on the covers. The toss will be delayed, though hopefully only for 10-15 minutes, with a strong wind ushering the clouds through. Rankin to Hughes, 1 wide sling this short and down the leg side - called this time Jordan to Hughes, 1 wide back of a length but down leg Jordan to Hughes, OUT dug in short again, tried tries to pull and Hughes has got a huge top edge - it loops to midwicket and Jordan leaps in the air to celebrate his first England wicket! Think Hughes was beaten for pace, the bottom hand came off the handle and he knew where this was going as soon as he connnected - poor Pippy, it's been a long few months Jordan to Finch, 1 leg bye works a single off the pads through square Stokes to Finch, OUT fullish, bit of width and Finch is tempted, doesn't get over a square drive and picks out Morgan first ball after the resumption! Not sure what Finch was thinking there, he surely could have done with a sighter, didn't need to go after that delivery but he's thrown away a promising start and the England players are singing in the post-rain Stokes to Wade, OUT and he's gloved his first ball behind, a golden duck for Wade! This is quackers, we've had a brief interruption and Australia have come out and lost two in two! Stokes beat Wade for pace with the bouncer, it was a touch leg side, again could have been ignored but the new batsman chased it, clear flick of glove and Stokes has another Jordan to Clarke, 1 wide drifts down the leg side again Jordan to Clarke, OUT another chance to mid-off, Pietersen's there this time and takes the catch as Clarke splices a pull stroke. Tried to open up the off side again did Clarke but didn't become a great position from which to play a pull stroke, perhaps got hurried by Jordan and got nowhere near enough on the stroke and it looped to Pietersen who showed Rankin how to do it Root to Bailey, OUT Bailey sweeps and misses, Buttler nudges off the bails and trots away to celebrate with Root - he seems pretty certain but the umpires send it upstairs to check. And the evidence is pretty clear, Bailey's foot stayed grounded just beyond his crease, he made no effort to get it back, so must have lost his bearings... This is going to be out, Root has done the trick, in slightly bizarre circumstances Stokes to Voges, OUT edged and gone, caught at the wicket with Buttler plunging to his right! Bit of a nothing stroke from Voges, half forward and attempting a little push, the ball kissed the edge and just about carried through Stokes to Watson, OUT steps away, swings the arms ... and nicks off! There'll be a few sighs of relief on the England balcony, as Watson was just threatening to take the game away again. He was looking to hit down the ground here but it wasn't quite full enough, Watson played down slightly the wrong line, small deflection and comfortably held Stokes to Johnson, OUT tries to turn to leg again, leading edge and gone, caught and bowled! Stokes has five-for! Johnson departs with alacrity, having made just a couple, and England have now claimed 5 for 73 in 13 overs (which would look a whole lot better without that Watson assault on Root) Jordan to Faulkner, OUT slightly back of a length and darting across Faulkner, Buttler throws himself down the leg side to take a sharp catch - was there a bit of glove on that? Umpire Dar thinks so but Faulkner immediately reviews. He thinks it flicked his sweater - and it did, but not before tickling the inside edge of the bat, Hot Spot clearly shows the mark and the decision is upheld. England have another Rankin to McKay, OUT McKay steps to leg, Rankin follows him and the slog across the line goes up in the air, to be safely pouched by the man coming in from deep square leg! Boyd Rankin, the pick of the attack, has a wicket at last and Australia have been bowled out for less than 300 6.05pm: Er, so how do you sum up that innings? It was helter skelter stuff, another very good Ageas Bowl pitch but Australia looked like they were going to easily get 350 at one stage; England will be delighted to have kept the target below 300, though 299 will still be a record chase here. Ben Stokes was the major beneficiary of Australia's bout of motion sickness but, spinners aside, the bowlers gave a decent account of themselves.

Faulkner to Carberry, OUT full and straight, wraps Carberry on the pads, huge cry for lbw, not out given but Clarke goes for the review. I reckon this is a good effort, Carberry got a long way down the pitch but it did look straight as he missed playing across it. No mark on Hot Spot and Hawk Eye has it crashing into middle stump, good review and Carberry is gone. He tried to shuffle across and create some angle for himself but missed.

Watson's 143 provided nearly half of Australia's total and his stand of 163 with Michael Clarke, who battled through with his troublesome back, was the defining period of the match and series. England's chase only ignited when Ravi Bopara and Jos Buttler were adding 92 in 13 overs; perhaps it was the autumnal chill which descended and left spectators huddle up in jacks that prevented an early spark. But by then it was a monumental task, even for Buttler's nerves of steel. Kevin Pietersen was run out in the third over and any remnants of a chance, however slim, disappeared when Eoin Morgan departed straight after the halfway mark of the innings."
"Stokes to Marsh, OUT bouncer, surprise delivery, hooked at and Buttler takes it well above his head, has Marsh gloved this? Yes he has and Stokes makes the breakthrough.

Dan Christian took a hat-trick in March 2012 and now McKay has repeated the feat.

On a surface where free-scoring was a rarity England struggled in their chase of 228, dented early on by Clint McKay's hat-trick, but just when the requirement was getting out of hand Buttler and Ben Stokes produced a strong argument as to why they have packed the batting order. Buttler had earlier been given out lbw on 8 but was saved by the DRS when it showed the ball sliding down the leg side. When the seventh-wicket pair joined forces England still needed 84 off 68 balls but overs 39 to 43 brought 40 runs as the equation started to favour the home side. Buttler eased the tension further by drilling James Faulkner into the River Taff and then brought up his half-century from 41 balls."
"Bopara to Finch, 1 leg bye works the ball of the pads into the leg side Tredwell to Finch, OUT goes for another big slog down the ground but picks out long-on!

Finn followed the batsman and slightly cramped him for room Johnson to Pietersen, 1 wide slip and a short midwicket to Pietersen, length down leg Johnson to Trott, 1 wide leg slip in straight away, bowled for the tuck to leg slip but got it too far down leg Johnson to Trott, OUT got him! Super delivery, back of a length, it bounced a little on Trott right on line and he nicked it through to Wade a cracking delivery from Johnson. An absolute beauty angled across Trott, it bounced on him, he couldn't get the bat out of the way and got a thick edge for a simple chance to Wade's right McKay to Pietersen, SIX runs length on off stump, this time when Pietersen clears the front leg he unleashes a big on-drive and nails it into the crowd, lovely flowing stroke and got plenty of it Watson to Pietersen, OUT on the attack and he's picked out cover! Watson's golden arm has hit the jackpot, Pietersen departing for a sprightly 60 but England probably needed double that... It was a length ball in the channel, KP drove on the up, didn't come out of the middle - swished slightly across the line, actually - and flew to Faulkner's Voges to Morgan, 1 wide drags this down the leg side, Morgan takes the extra Voges to Bopara, OUT pushed back by Bopara, taken in his follow through by Voges and he's convinced this is caught and bowled... If so, it's a very soft dismissal. The umpires decide to check it, Bopara was just tapping down the ground, stopped in the shot and it came off the toe, Voges eased Morgan aside to take the catch and that will be out. Voges to Morgan, 1 wide very leg side, dross from Voges McKay to Stokes, OUT yet again slow, 65mph, pulled from outside off, nowhere near enough bat on it, comes off a top edge and flies straight down the throat of deep backward square leg. McKay has bowled several excellent slow deliveries and this has bagged him another wicket. A total miscue from Stokes, miles away from the meat of the bat, it we Faulkner to Buttler, SIX runs another back of the hand delivery but this one Buttler sees early and whacks it off the stumps over midwicket, a long way back that's gone, great strike and a first ODI fifty for Jos Buttler, an innings he desperately needed McKay to Buttler, SIX runs full ball on off stump and Buttler swings merrily through the line and clears long-on, another big thump from Jos Fawad to Buttler, OUT goes again but this is straight up, Johnson goes back from mid-on a few yards and takes a comfortable catch. He's thumped a few nicely today Buttler but that was a total miscue that went a long way up off a top edge, trying again to swing away a ball floated up on the stumps. Good solid catch from Johnson Fawad to Finn, SIX runs tossed up on the stumps and Finn gets down to slog sweep and nails it into the crowd, great shot, great timing McKay to Finn, OUT full on the stumps, Finn tries to clear the leg side again but picks out deep midwicket and that'll do nicely for Australia. Finn didn't nail this like his strikes in the previous over and couldn't clear the deep fielder, Adam Voges, who completed a comfortable catch and handed a third wicket to Clint McKay Australia's bowling effort was probably the more impressive part of the match. They had Mitchell Johnson in great form, bowling with pace and aggression and ripping out two early wickets to handicap England's effort. It was a sign that perhaps Johnson will be ready to return to Test duty come Novemeber. He was backed up exceptionally well by Clint McK So that wraps up this first ODI.

A graceful first hundred against England in one-day internationals was followed by an overwhelming victory. For Australia's captain, it was a rare visit this summer to the pleasure palace. England's pursuit of 316 for victory was a non-event, their defeat every bit as comprehensive as the 88-run margin indicates. They had never chased down such a total in ODIs, their best effort being 306 for 5 against Pakistan in Karachi 13 years ago."

And if you're following the home side's fortunes, you could Starc to de Kock, SIX runs heaved into the crowd again! Short from Starc, sweet from de Kock, who swipes up and over deep backward square leg Zampa to de Kock, 1 run smashed over deep midwicket for six SMITH!! You cannot do that... Brilliantly caught on the boundary as he dives beyond the rope, and then hurled back in before touching the ground! Keeps them to one! Amazing Kane Richardson to Hendricks, OUT short ball, pace off... and pulled to deep square leg! Laboured innings from Hendricks, who was done by the legcutter from Richardson, bowling well to his field. Safely taken by Dre Russ/Sir Jaddu in the outfield Kane Richardson to van der Dussen, 1 leg bye smacks into the thigh and deflects behind point... Richardson liked it, but that looked very high, to me. No inclination to review Kane Richardson to van der Dussen, OUT Rassie holes out to deep square leg! The legcutter does the job again, nothing for van der Dussen to work with as he swings for the pickets, safely taken a few yards in from the rope 4pm: Is that a defendable score? Is it a competitive score...? South Africa started so well, Quinton de Kock charging to 43 out of 59-0 in the Powerplay, but then got bogged down as Australia's bowlers adapted. A target of 159 is unlikely to intimidate a line-up as power-packed as Australia's, but that is what they need to seal the series with one to play. Join us again shortly, Over in the PSL, Chris Lynn is out early on for perennial strugglers Lahore Qalandars. Over the wicket, no slip. Ngidi to Warner, 1 wide speared down the leg side, early pressure on Ngidi Shamsi to Warner, 1 leg bye fired in at leg stump, tucked down to short fine leg off the thigh pad Ngidi to Marsh, 1 wide uses his feet, shuffling across to the off side, Ngidi pushes it wider in response but it's some way outside of the tramline and he's called out for it Ngidi to Marsh, OUT in the slot outside off, clubbed high and mighty down the ground... Faf is racing round from long-on, dives to grab it, parries it back in, and Miller, at full stretch, gets a hand underneath the relay throw to take an absolute BLINDER! Outrageous fielding. Du Plessis only just got to it, his parry was flat and low to the ground, but Miller reacted to Time for the presentation: Player of the match is Quinton de Kock, SA","South Africa 158 for 4 (de Kock 70, Richardson 2-21) beat Australia 146 for 6 (Warner 67*, Ngidi 3-41) by 12 runs South African cricket enjoyed its best day of the summer as both the men's and women's teams won in the final over of their respective T20s to secure results of great significance. The women beat England in the opening match of their T20 World Cup campaign, while the men stayed alive in the three-match rubber against Australia with a series-levelling victory in Port Elizabeth. South Africa defended a requirement of 25 runs off the last three overs on a subcontinental-like surface, where run-scoring slowed down in the second half of both teams' innings. The victory will come as a major morale booster for a South Africa side that have not won a trophy this season but remain in the hunt to change that in the coming week. The decider will be played on Wednesday in Cape Town, the scene of the start of Quinton de Kock's takeover as permanent white-ball captain."
"7.32pm Bangladesh big favourites to go up 2-0 in this series. If it was spinners that caused damage yesterday, today it was the fast bowlers who used their cutters really well. Marsh impressed once again, on a surface that is tough, yes, but one that can't be used as an excuse to brush away the way the middle and lower-middle order fell apart. A marginally better but overall disappointing effort from the openers. Wade failed to get going, Turner and Agar fell prey to the pacers' skills, and if Water break. Fairly humid out there. Tye to Afif, 1 wide back of a length, outside leg stump. Walks across to pull towards fine leg but misses. Gets the wide though 9.30pm A fist pump between the two youngsters who have dragged Bangladesh out of a very deep hole. Even Justin Langer is applauding them. A lone fan is flying the flag on a nearly building's roof. Imagine if we had a full crowd today! The partnership is unbeaten on 56.... to win from 67/5 with Australia's bowlers roaring, it needed a special effort. That's all from myself Sreshth, Andrew McGlashan and Ranjith P. Remember there's plenty of cricket happening. England v India and the Hundred. Hop over there to enjoy more cricket. See you! Bangladesh won by 5 wickets (with 8 balls remaining) Player of the match is Afif Hossain, BAN","Australia 362 for 3 (Marsh 151, Finch 148) beat Scotland 162 (Machan 39, Johnson 4-36) by 200 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Aaron Finch peppered the boundary with seven sixes and 16 fours Getty Images Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh shared an opening stand of 246 - the second-highest Australia partnership for any wicket in ODIs - in a clinical dissection of Scotland, who were beaten by 200 runs. The pair erased Geoff Marsh and David Boon's Australia record of 212 for an opening partnership, made against India and a record that had stood proudly since 1986. That wasn't the only record to fall. Australia's 362 for 3 surpassed the 345 they scored against the same team, made here four years ago, and the 334 for 6 they made against Scotland at the 2007 World Cup. In the field, the hosts were athletic and efficient, but their bowling was blunt."
"Ashwin to Finch, OUT 86 kph, length ball pitching on middle as Ashwin, who is coming round the wicket, breaches Finch's defences as he goes for an improvised flick, but fails to get bat on it. Ball castles into the stumps, and its two down now for the Australians Jadeja to Watson, (no ball) 92 kph, Watson, looking to go over midwicket, ends up spooning this up through mid off, with Rohit Sharma taking a straight forward catch. But hang on. Looks like the umpire has called back Watson to the wicket as they refer the decision to third umpire. And the news all of India don't want to hear has just occurred as it looks as if he did in fact go over just slightly. So it's a front foot no-ball, and a free hit for the Australian batsmen. Tough times inde Ashwin to Watson, 1 wide bowler's response is to bowl the carrom-ball, but this one is down the leg side Ashwin to Watson, 1 wide another attempted carrom ball, but this one is down the leg side and the batsman lets it go to earn his bonus Shami to Watson, OUT oh Shami roars as he splatter the stumps with an inducker! Watson has to go straight after getting to his 100. It was a length delivery and came back in. Watson was looking to drive it down the ground on the up, but it missed the inside edge to hit off and middle. Ashwin to Maxwell, OUT excellent catch in the deep by bhuvneshwar! Ashwin had changed the line to off, but that wasn't going to make much difference for Maxwell. He went deep in the crease spotting the shortness of length and swung his hammer aiming for the deep midwicket stand. But Bhuvneshwar keeps his composure at the boundary pulling off a well-judged one catch. He punches the air. Ashwin takes a gasp.. Jadeja to Johnson, OUT fuller length ball just outside off which Johnson gets down on one knee to slog, but finds Dhawan stationed at deep midwicket. Will the umpires check the front foot no-ball too? Looks like the umpires will have spared him the embarrassment just for now. Wickets beginning to fall in a heap, but it doesn't really matter with 346 on the board Johnson to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide 152 kph, another wide down the leg side from Johnson as this one begins to rise after pitching Finch to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs he bowls it too full, provides Rohit the space to get under it and smack it over wide long on for a six Finch to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide fires this one quicker, but loses direction as it's down the leg side Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye fuller delivery on the pads, Dhawan wanted to paddle it fine, but gets hit on the pads. But that would have gone down the leg side with the angle Faulkner to S Dhawan, OUT 136 kph, and its all over for Da-One. Looking to improvise a flick behind square on the leg side through fine leg, he ends up stepping out to the off side. Faulkner must have seen this coming as he releases the ball on a middle to leg stump line, which ends up castling the southpaw's wicket. So Dhawan was unable to make this century count for more, but still a fine effort considering the circumstances. Makes that the third century of the match as well. Johnson to Raina, 1 wide 140 kph, starts off wide a wide delivery down the leg side. A rather anti-climatic start, but Mitch certainly has the goods, especially on the subcontinent Well it's all done and dusted then. After six matches (which included a rain out in Ranchi and an even more rained-out match in Cuttack (which got called off)) the series is levelled at 2-2, with the final match in Bangalore to decide the series. With four centuries in the match, it was certainly a more memorable counter between these two sides. So now its off to Bangalore for the November 2 decider. On behalf of Devashish Fuloria and the scorers, this is Rohan Sharma saying good night, and good India won by 6 wickets (with 3 balls remaining) Player of the match is Virat Kohli, INDIA","50 overs India 351 for 4 (Kohli 115*, Dhawan 100, Rohit 79) beat Australia 350 for 6 (Bailey 156, Watson 102) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Champion of the chase: Virat Kohli now has 11 hundreds in 64 chases BCCI Push the boundaries, shift the goalposts, change vocabularies. Three hundred and fifty no longer inspires awe. Not when Indian batsmen are batting on flat Indian pitches surrounded by quick outfields with only four fielders outside the circle and two new balls to kill any chance of reverse swing. With Shikhar Dhawan's assured century at the top, and Virat Kohli's 61-ball one at No. 3 - the third-fastest by an Indian, challenging his own record of 52 balls - India became the first team to have chased down 350 or more twice, both of them in this series, and both without much frenzy."
"Johnson to Raina, OUT the short ball has done the job, Raina goes for the pull but that flies off the toe end of the bat towards slip, Johnson has got the breakthrough Australia brought him back for Johnson to Yuvraj, OUT golden duck for Yuvraj! that was 148.6 kph from Mitchell Johnson, back of a length ball just outside off, Yuvraj fishes at that one well away from his body, nicks it through to the keeper, Johnson showing again just how dangerous he is with the white ball in the subcontinent Maxwell to Kohli, OUT and Maxwell has done it, the massive wicket of Kohli who is dismissed for 68, Kohli gets on the front foot initially, then gets back and looks to power the ball through off, outside off and a thin edge through to the keeper, Kohli is frustrated at having given it away, India's lower order has a big task on their Johnson to Ashwin, 1 wide short ball down the leg side Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 leg bye short of length ball on the pads, looking to whip that away towards midwicket, off the pads towards the off side Watson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye Dhoni looking to whip the ball towards the leg side, misses and is hit on the pads, that was sliding down Johnson to Ashwin, OUT is that a caught-behind? Ashwin was looking to dab the ball down to third man once more, it's a shot that has been very profitable for him over his career, gets a thick edge, and that is a terrific take from Haddin, leaping to his left and plucking a low chance, the umpires want to double check that it carried, Watson to Dhoni, SIX runs Dhoni power! that is pitched up and absolutely drilled by Dhoni for six over long-off, brutal hit that, no doubt it was going to clear the rope Faulkner to Bhuvneshwar, OUT short ball gets another wicket, Bhiuvneshwar goes for the pull but slices that high and it ends as an easy catch to Bailey at midwicket Watson to Dhoni, 1 wide wide outside off Watson to Dhoni, 1 wide much too wide from Watson, he is under immense pressure when bowling to a master finisher like Dhoni Faulkner to Dhoni, SIX runs there's the helicopter, the crowd is loving it, Australia are hating it, what a player this man is, it wa sa length ball just outside off, Dhoni waits on the back foot and absolutely clobbers that over long-on 5.50pm Indian players in a huddle and out march Aaron Finch and Phil Hughes. Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the new ball and two slips. Here we go... Vinay to Hughes, 1 wide pithes it outside leg and goes down further for a wide Vinay to Hughes, 4 leg byes down leg again but Dhoni doesn't give it a try this time. It may not have been out of his reach but he stared back at Vinay after it went for four Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 leg bye big appeal but it was going down leg. It was short of length and swinging into the batsman, even struck him just outside leg on the pads Bhuvneshwar to Hughes, 1 leg bye angled into the pads again, goes down leg for another leg bye Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 leg bye another lbw appeal and it was going down leg again as it swung in and Australia get another leg bye after Finch missed it Sharma to Finch, 1 leg bye on the leg stump and going down, Finch tried to flick it hard but gets a leg bye to deep fine leg Vinay to Finch, 1 wide on leg and goes down further for a wide Sharma to Finch, OUT umpire raises the finger! Ishant has struck even though it struck him in front of leg and may have gone down leg. He angled it in, Finch was crammed for room on the back foot and the Indian players went up for Shamsuddin to raise his finger. It was very very close, hard to say if it was hitting or missing Jadeja to Voges, 1 wide goes down the leg side for a wide Yuvraj to Bailey, 1 leg bye going down leg again, hits him on the pad for a leg bye Jadeja to Bailey, 1 wide speared down the leg side Ashwin to Bailey, SIX runs flighted from Ashwin, and that is smashed for six, it was a nice length, Bailey gets under it and hammers it towards cow corner for the first six of the innings Jadeja to Voges, 1 leg bye reverts to his leg side line, off the pads for a legbye Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, SIX runs there's one of those boundaries, short ball is slugged over midwicket for six, power hitting from Faulkner Ashwin to Faulkner, 1 leg bye again off the pads as the batsman shuffles around in the crease, the legstump line from Ashwin from round the wicket isn't making it easy for Australia Sharma to Faulkner, SIX runs what an amazing hit that is, this was short from Ishant, sat up for Faulkner, who clobbers that to cow corner, he enjoyed that shot, it went a long way beyond the rope, 10 off the first two balls, what will Ishant serve up now? first he has to get the ball back, it went into the crowd and hasn't been retu Doubly impressive from Faulkner as he was taken apart in the final over by Dhoni, he's turned it around with the bat though, and how? Australia won by 4 wickets (with 3 balls remaining) Player of the match is James Faulkner, AUS","Australia 304 for 6 (Voges 76*, Faulkner 64*) beat India 303 for 9 (Dhoni 139*, Kohli 68, Johnson 4-46) by four wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details James Faulkner smashed a 29-ball 64 to set up the win BCCI While lifting India from 76 for 4 to 303 for 9, MS Dhoni had spoiled James Faulkner's figures at the death. Faulkner took it out on Ishant Sharma at the death in Australia's chase. Rarely, if ever, has a bowler lost it so completely while bowling to a fellow bowler. Australia needed 44 off 18 when Ishant was given the ball. Six balls and 30 runs later off Faulkner's bat, the game was effectively over."
"Vinay to Finch, OUT Raina does the trick with the bowlers hardly looking likely to get the wicket. Finch dabbed it to the covers off the back foot and set off for a quick single, but even as he stretched out to make his ground, the throw had already broken the stumps Jadeja to Hughes, SIX runs he comes down the track and gives it a mightly swipe, it goes over deep midwicket for a six to bring up the team's 100 Jadeja to Watson, SIX runs oh he is in some mood, he just lifts this tossed up delivery over the head of the bowler. For a second Ashwin at long off was interested, but it clears him with ease Ashwin to Watson, SIX runs oh welcome! long hop is what Watson has been hitting well, so long hop it will be.. Watson sends it into the crowds through deep midwicket Vinay to Watson, OUT he has disappeared trying to up the rate! It was a short of length delivery outside off and Watson tries to power it over long on with a flat-bat hammer hit, but ends up hitting it high rather than long, it descends at long on where Ishant takes a well-judged catch Jadeja to Bailey, SIX runs No nudging this time though. 92 kph ball on off stump is met with a smart skip down the track and lofted over the bowler's head. Rohit Sharma at long-off was interested for a second or so before he watched it sail over his head Ashwin to Hughes, OUT and he finally strikes, although only just. Dhoni had to juggle it a few times to keep the ball in his gloves. A little turn outside the off stump forces the edge to be taken off the intended cut shot from Hughes. He isn't too happy with the decision though. There was a big edge though Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs pitched on leg and turning further, Maxwell goes down on one knee and smashes the ball over the fine leg boundary with a powerful sweep shot Sharma to Bailey, SIX runs another slower ball, but this has been spotted and dispatched. Made a little room for himself and launched into a full-blooded drive over the top of the bowler Jadeja to Bailey, SIX runs on middle stump and Bailey employs the slog sweep to excellent effect. The ball is lifted over midwicket boundary. 87m six as Australia are motoring along Sharma to Maxwell, 1 wide the leg stump line continues and even with Maxwell going for a wild slog over the top of short fine leg, the ball was too wide to connect Sharma to Maxwell, 1 wide and again. Maxwell was on his knees this time, hoping to exploit the vacant area at deep fine leg, but he would need a ten foot pole to have reached that Vinay to Voges, OUT the reverse scoop proves fatal for Voges. It was full and outside off, which meant he had to change his shot from the orthodox scoop and he doesnt get enough bat on it to beat Bhuvi at short third man 5.00pm Brad Haddin had said Australia were looking to limit quick wickets in the middle and put on a better batting performance in Jaipur after putting up 304 on the board. Safe to say mistakes rectified. Australia's openers laid a solid foundation and their middle order contributed quite heavily to record the first time in ODIs Johnson to S Dhawan, 1 wide he bowls this one down the leg side, it was one of the slower ones, 131 kph Watson to S Dhawan, 5 wide more extras, this one is pounded halfway down the pitch and it takes off way over the batsman and far away from the keeper Johnson to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye that yorker was speared in on leg stump. Dhawan hoped to flick it fine, but the ball dips in a little more to beat the bat and hit his pads and sneak off towards fine leg Faulkner to S Dhawan, OUT he's nicked it. And Dhawan admonishes himself as he walks off, five short of a century. James Faulkner though is over the moon. It was a good length ball outside off and Dhawan went for his cover drive, but this time his edges is taken instead of the middle Faulkner to Kohli, SIX runs down the track again and this time he gets six for it. While Fualkner goes for a tumble, Kohli stands and admires the shot as the full length ball aimed outside off sails over the long-off fence McKay to Kohli, SIX runs off cutter gets smashed. Kohli has been violent when he gets down the track. He stays leg side of the ball to get all the leverage he needs to punish it over the top of long-off Johnson to Kohli, 5 wide aims for a yorker, it's officially the bad Mitch today, he sprays it wide down the leg side and Haddin could do nothing to stop that Johnson to Kohli, 1 wide back of the length and fired down the leg side, from wide of the crease. MJ says it flicked the pads, but the umpire doesn't agree Maxwell to Kohli, SIX runs comes down the pitch, Maxwell saw him and bowled it quick, but it doesn't matter because Kohli launches it over cow corner with ease Doherty to Kohli, SIX runs clears his front leg out and smashes the tossed up delivery from leg stump to over cow corner This has been some hitting festival! This is so wrong, India winning this match by nine wickets (nine wickets!!), with six and a half overs to spare, who would have thought that at the mid-innings break? Shikhar Dhawan started it, Rohit Sharma held it together and Virat Kohli just ran away with it. India have squared up the seve What a day for the batsmen it has been? The series is now 1-1 and it moves to Mohali for the third match. We will be back with our match coverage then. In the meantime, Abhishek Purohit is getting his match report together and will be available on the site soon. Thanks for all your comments and feedback. It's Devashish Fuloria a India won by 9 wickets (with 39 balls remaining) Player of the match is Rohit Sharma, INDIA","India 362 for 1 (Rohit 141*, Kohli 100*, Dhawan 95) beat Australia 359 for 5 (Bailey 92*, Hughes 83) by nine wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details India's openers put on 176 in 26.1 overs BCCI ""Now this is another fine mess you've got us into,"" goes the constant refrain from India's batsmen to their bowlers. At times, the mess is so huge the batsmen fail to clear it up, despite their best efforts. At times, the batsmen do such a thorough job, their refrain to the bowlers changes to, ""So that's all you've got?"" It was the latter occasion tonight. India's bowlers leaked 359, the same score they had in the 2003 World Cup final."
"Jadeja to Hughes, OUT Would you believe it! Dhoni has a leg slip positioned just behind and Hughes obliges by taking a back of a length delivery which spins into him, and he eases it behind, but straight into the clutches of Raina. My feeling is that he did not see him there in the first place, and mixed with the amount of turn, ends up leading to his downfall Yuvraj to Watson, OUT How prophetic am I? He has taken out the Big Kahuna, with Watson lofting a fuller delivery on and around off straight into the waiting hands of Jadeja at long on Yuvraj to Finch, OUT flighted delivery outside off and Yuvraj is having a whale of a time as he gets Finch to go for the lofted shot, but ends up mishitting this straight up in the air, which carries to Virat Kohli, one of India's best fielders, who is waiting at long off. Big wicket for India as Finch was threatening to play a big innings Sharma to Bailey, OUT back of a length outside off and the Aussies take on Yuvraj's fielding, as he swoops in towards point and fires in a throw at the striker's end which Voges, who dives in vain, is unable to get to. However, once he gets past the crease, he curls into the fetus position, as he seems to be in some pain. But as I glance over he is walking back to the dressing room as th Ashwin to Maxwell, SIX runs Ashwin what are you doing? As he is about to release he holds in anticipation of what Maxwell will be doing, but it really doesnt matter as he offers a juicy full toss going down the leg side which Maxwell hammers over square leg for six Vinay to Maxwell, SIX runs he is making the most of the powerplay, it's a fuller length delivery outside off and he picks it up over cover with the cleanest of the swings, clears the ropes easily Vinay to Maxwell, OUT he has thrown it away, he tries to play a similar shot to what he played off the last delivery, but the length was slightly short, and he ends up toe-ending it straight to cover Ashwin to Haddin, OUT this one is plumb, Haddin was deep in his crease and tried to flick this flatter delivery towards the leg side, but it was pushed a bit quicker too and Haddin was beaten to be hit right in front of the middle stump. That would have gone on to hit the top of the middle Ashwin to Bailey, OUT and he holes out at deep midwicket! The shot was on though, it was a tossed up delivery on off and Bailey aimed for the stands at deep midwicket, he just doesn't get as much as he would have liked behind that and the fielder takes a simple catch right on the edge of the boundary Vinay to Faulkner, SIX runs another length ball, but this time Faulkner gets it in the meat, it's flat and it flies through that gap between Ashwin and Ishant again Sharma to McKay, SIX runs slower delivery on a length, asking to be hit, McKay swings and gets it right of the meat, sends it soaring in the Pune sky to the stands at deep midwicket So the Australian fielders are in place. Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are out at the wicket. India need 305 to win and they are facing Mitchell Johnson first up, who has a wonderful record on the subcontinent. Doherty to Raina, SIX runs ah, he comes down the pitch and is nicely to the pitch of the ball, he lifts it straight over the bowler's head, heads towards the sight screen Watson to Kohli, OUT that's the end of Kohli! Watson, after sending a few short ones, slips in a length delivery and Kohli tries to whip this to square leg across the line. He is hit on the knee roll and that would have crashed into the leg stump. The umpire didn't waste any time. That looked plumb the moment it hit the pads. Australia on top here, excellent bowling from Watson again McKay to Dhoni, 1 leg bye bowls a slower delivery, 107 kph, and on the pads, Dhoni has to wait a lot for it, and it hits the pad as it messes with Dhoni's whip. It was heading down the leg side Johnson to Vinay, 1 leg bye 144 kph, Vinay misses this entirely as it deflects off his pads to the same region, only this time a single is afforded Well there you have it. Australia go 1-0 up in the series, against most of the expert's predictions, and India now have their work cut out as they need to keep Australia from winning the series 6-1 in order to protect their number one ODI ranking. Bailey will be especially pleased with how his players, both batsmen and bowlers, fared today, and it should give them confidence into the rest of th Player of the match is George Bailey, AUS","Australia 304 for 8 (Bailey 85, Finch 72) beat India 232 (Kohli 61, Faulkner 3-47) by 72 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details James Faulkner gave away only nine runs in his three batting Powerplay overs BCCI Australia showed just why they have been so successful in ODIs in India, and just why India's usual template of chasing anything their profligate bowlers concede often comes short against the visitors. Their batsmen powered their side over 300 on a slow and, at times, uneven pitch. Their fast bowlers then extracted appreciable bite from the same pitch and used the short ball intelligently to finish the contest by the end of the batting Powerplay. Tellingly, India have never successfully chased 300-plus against Australia, and this was their 11th failed attempt, this time against a side lacking several first-choice players. The only time India looked relatively comfortable was during the 71-run third-wicket partnership between Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina, who was promoted to No 4 ahead of Yuvraj Singh."
"India has won the toss and elected to bowl first, because the pitch has been under cover for some time and there might be something for the bowlers early on, says MS Dhoni. Bhuvneshwar to Maddinson, OUT gone! Bit of inexperience there you have to think. He was batting so well, playing decent shots, but he goes for an ungainly swipe across the line, and Kumar comes in from around the wicket to angle one in. Maddinson misses, Bhuvneshwar hits the top of off stump and sends the wicket flying. Promising first innings though. Vinay to Watson, OUT jagged back in sharply, off a length and it misses Watson's big off drive. Hits him on the back pad and he has to go. Very good ball Vinay to Bailey, OUT short ball on the stumps and Bailey doesn't last long. He pulls that one, but not very well. The mistimed stroke goes straight to the man at deep square leg. Second wicket of the over, and it could be a match-changing one for India Ashwin to Finch, 2 wide way wide down the leg side, not even Dhoni can collect Kohli to Maxwell, SIX runs it keeps raining sixes, and it's in that cow corner area again. Shortish on the stumps, and Maxwell slams that just over the deep midwicket boundary for another biggie Jadeja to Maxwell, OUT he's gone now. Maxwell was aiming for yet another six, but Jadeja does him in the flight, and he mistimes this to Ishant Sharma at long on, who takes it just inside the rope, I think. Umpires check it and replays show that Sharma didn't touch the boundary. Good catch, and a decent ball from Jadeja. Took the bottom edge I think, Bhuvneshwar to Haddin, OUT short, wide and out. That deserved to go the boundary, but instead it ends in the wicketkeeper's gloves. Might have moved slightly off the seam, but it wasn't much. Haddin cuts at it, and gets a top edge to the keeper Vinay to Finch, OUT he's got him. Can you believe it's off a knee-high full toss? That's floated up to Finch, who misjudges the pace, and is too early on the shot. He gets an under-edge and hits it straight back to the bowler, who seems to hurt his finger as he holds on. End of a very good innings. Bhuvneshwar to Henriques, OUT and another slower ball does the trick. Shortish one, outside off stump. Henriques tries to pull but again, is too early and a leading edge balloons to point Sharma to Faulkner, SIX runs and they get to 200 with a big one off the last ball. Poor ball from Ishant. It was full on the stumps and right in the slot. Faulkner just swings big and connects well enough to clear the boundary at wide mid-on. Watson to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide saw the swing and got a little overexcited. Angles this way too far down the leg side, and though there was some swing, that's a good-sized wide Doherty to Kohli, 1 wide sends the first one wide down the leg side, good collection by the keeper Coulter-Nile to Yuvraj, 1 wide full and down the leg side, that is called a wide Doherty to Dhoni, 1 leg bye fired in quick, on the pads, looking to work that to the leg side, can't connect, good over so far Faulkner to Yuvraj, 1 leg bye pitched up and heading for the pads, Yuvraj looking to whip that to the leg side, he misses, hits the pads but that would have missed leg stump Faulkner to Yuvraj, SIX runs length ball on middle and off, sensational hit from Yuvraj Singh, a straight six, hardly seemed to be putting any effort in that, the ball sails towards the sightscreen and that's a 25-ball half-century for Yuvraj Dhoni put the finishing touches in the last over, but this was all about Yuvraj Singh. Comeback game, and he has shown what he's capable off, lifting the spirits of Indian fans (at least a bit) after this afternoon's big announcement. India won by 6 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Yuvraj Singh, INDIA","India 202 for 4 (Yuvraj 77*) beat Australia 201 for 7 (Finch 89, Vinay 3-26) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Yuvraj Singh hunted down the target of 202 with the calm of old BCCI 4:05 Aakash Chopra: 'Yuvraj, the perennial comeback man' In his second comeback after recovering from cancer, a leaner and fitter Yuvraj Singh was called upon to do a job he has done numerous times for India in ODIs - revive a floundering chase, with MS Dhoni for company, and only the lower order to follow. Only, this was a T20 and Yuvraj did not have the luxury of building his innings before accelerating. He duly cut out the building part, and unleashed trademark pick-up sixes and lofted drives to haul in the target of 202 with two deliveries remaining. India were facing an asking-rate of nearly 12 at 100 for 4 in the 12th over, but Yuvraj's response was so forceful, that all Dhoni needed to do was give him the strike. By the end, the partnership was 102 at exactly two runs a ball, Yuvraj's 77 off 35 showing his dominance."
"Swann to Johnson, SIX runs Johnson continues to land punches on Swann, his eye is in and he waits for a juicy, tossed-up apple and then takes a big bite, bludgeoning the ball over long-on Broad to Johnson, OUT Broad gets his fifth! That's the end of a terrific fighting partnership, and it ended thanks to the new ball and Stuart Broad's swing, he curves this one back in to the left-hander, Johnson tries to play straight but it nips between bat and pad and clobbers the middle stump. Anderson to Siddle, OUT and there is the edge! Anderson deserved that, he had beaten Siddle a number of times and this one just moved a fraction away and Siddle's defensive push is collected low to the ground at first slip Harris to Cook, OUT probing outside off, Cook is drawn into playing and there's a visible deflection through to Haddin - Australia have the breakthrough they needed! Harris, into his sixth over, has been immaculate as ever and he gets Cook again, reward for his persistence. The delivery maybe nibbled away a touch off the sea Johnson to Trott, OUT short and down the leg side, Trott plays away from his body and Haddin goes up in celebration - they've got him, Johnson has done it, on the stroke of lunch! Just as England did yesterday, Australia have plucked out the No. 3 just as the napkins were being laid out. Clarke in the slips wasn't sure but H Harris to Pietersen, OUT gone! Massive moment. Pietersen has clipped it straight to midwicket. Australia have thought they can get Pietersen that way. It was full on middle, it came right out of the screws, but straight to George Bailey. Australia nudge their noses in front Johnson to Carberry, OUT short, speared across and takes the edge, he's gone, Johnson does it again! Superbly planned and executed by Australia, Carberry was clearly discomfited by that line of attack, Johnson beating out a tattoo of short deliveries that rose towards the ribcage, this slid across and although he tried to wi Lyon to Bell, OUT spin and bounce, is there a little bit of glove as it pops to short leg? Yes, there is! Bell is gone, Lyon roars in delight, this trampolined off the surface as the batsman went back, the ball hit thigh pad and just a tickle of bat/glove, straight into the hands of the close catcher! The Gabba's grisly magi Lyon to Prior, OUT and is that another? Prior lobs the ball to short leg - or does he? Smith took it again at short leg, throwing himself to his right, but Dar wasn't convinced. Australia review after a brief discussion and it looks like a brilliant decision, as replays show the ball coming off the inside edge on to pad. Sup Johnson to Root, OUT full and wide, Root drives, huge edge and another one falls! England are in tatters, seven down, all their batsmen back in the coop! What was Root doing there?! It was pitched up, leaving him and he threw the bat, a loose drive, steering the ball into the midriff of third slip, Smith again. Australia in Johnson to Swann, OUT gone! Amazing, incredible scenes at the Gabba, England eight down! This is becoming a collapse for the ages, Swann the latest to be swallowed up, Johnson again the tormentor. He was hanging back for the short ball, this was on a length, on leg stump, he wasn't forward and an inside edge ballooned off th What an innings that was. At 82 for 2 it seemed pretty steady, then the hostile brilliance of Johnson, the canny spin of Lyon, the smart captaincy of Clarke and some batting that verged in the inept at times has led to this. Australia lead by 159 and there are 25 overs, light permitting, left today. Will be interesting to see who E Innings Start Slip, gully and a short leg in place. No silly point","Australia 295 (Haddin 94, Johnson 64, Broad 6-81) and 7 for 401 dec (Warner 124, Clarke 113, Haddin 53) beat England 136 (Johnson 4-61, Harris 3-28) and 173 (Cook 65, Johnson 5-42) by 381 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details 24:58 The field set for Mitchell Johnson summed up Australia's supremacy as they closed in on victory in the first Test at the Gabba. Every fielder was there for the kill: four slips, a fly slip, two leg slips, silly mid off, short leg. Australia were all over England - or at least Johnson was - and after tea it briefly felt like the 1970s again with Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in their pomp. Australia needed this win badly. They had not won a Test in 10 attempts and an Ashes Test in eight goes."
"South African have won the toss and chosen to chase. Shamsi to Smith, 1 wide down the leg side again, Shamsi under the pump. Short boundary is on the off side, hence this line Phehlukwayo to Finch, 1 wide short and wide, and he'll have to bowl it again. Sloppy stuff from SA Shamsi to Finch, OUT Finch steps outside leg, Shamsi follows him, he throws everything through the shot regardless but can't time it. Faf du Plessis settles underneath it at deep midwicket, and takes a good catch on the rope! Just about stayed inside the rope, and that breaks a very useful partnership Shamsi to Smith, 1 wide, OUT length ball, down the leg side again and Smith uses his feet looking to work through midwicket... he can't lay bat on it, and de Kock whips the bails off! Think Shamsi saw him coming, dragged it down the leg side, and that's a very sharp stumping made to look easy by QdK. Huge moment! Rabada to Carey, 1 wide hung wide outside the off stump, and called wide Phehlukwayo to Marsh, 1 wide wide yorker outside off, left alone and called wide. Phehlukwayo grimaces towards the umpire, but it looked like a fair call Phehlukwayo to Carey, OUT full on off stump, Carey throws everything at it but it flies straight up into the air... Faf sets himself at backward point, it comes down with snow on it but he takes an excellent catch before falling onto his back! Relief, after what seemed like an eternity under the high ball Steyn to Wade, OUT slower ball, length outside off, huge blow high into the air, but it's not got the distance on it to clear the long side of the ground... Miller settles underneath it at deep midwicket, and takes the catch! De Kock's aggressive move does the trick as Steyn strikes Ngidi to Marsh, OUT length outside off, clubbed very high into the leg side, and Steyn takes a brilliant catch! Looks to mow one over midwicket, top-edged it towards square leg, where Steyn ran in and round, before diving to take the chance... EDIT: only just clung on, landed in the fingertips and very nearly popped out! Cummins to van der Dussen, OUT slapped straight up, h-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g-h towards third man... and taken by Starc! He had to plunge forward as the ball threatened to land short of him, but held it well, a spiralling chance into the Joburg night sky as RVD? flung the hands at a miscued drive. Cummins strikes second ball Agar to Rabada, SIX runs whumped into the empty stands at deep midwicket! Cleanly struck slog-sweep from KG, gives the crowd something to cheer Starc to Rabada, 1 wide slides a length ball down the leg side for a wide Player of the match is Ashton Agar, AUS","Australia 196 for 6 (Smith 45, Shamsi 2-31, Steyn 2-31) beat South Africa 89 (du Plessis 24, Agar 5-24) by 108 runs Ashton Agar claimed the 13th hat-trick in T20I cricket and the second for Australia after Brett Lee as South Africa were dismissed for their lowest score in the format to lose by their biggest margin in a thrashing at the Wanderers. Agar finished with a career-best 5 for 24 to take Australia to an eighth straight T20I win, and to the top of the ICC's rankings. They extend a successful run that dates back to February 2019, and take the lead in the three-match series. While South Africa's batting implosion will hog the headlines, their fielding should also come under scrutiny after a wayward performance, with too many short, wide deliveries against a rampant Australian line-up. Aaron Finch and Steve Smith galloped along at 10 runs an over in a second-wicket stand of 80 and even though South Africa pulled Australia back, 49 runs in the last five overs left them with a big total to chase."
"McKay to S Dhawan, 3 wide he bowls a fuller outswinging delivery again, and like the last over, it swings too far down the leg side, Haddin only gets a hand to it Faulkner to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs and this one is lobbed too, lobbed all the way to the stands over long-off, it's just a beautiful aerial cover drive and the timing gives it all the distance Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, 1 wide he targets the pads, but he pushes it too far down the leg side Doherty to S Dhawan, OUT Dhawan's gone! Doherty has struck here. He's not been flighting the ball much and pitched this one around middle from round the wicket and the ball turned into the batsman after pitching. He played across the line and missed it, plumb he was! Doherty to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs another one goes all the way. Rohit is targeting the spinners. Tossed up on middle and Rohit drove it straight down the ground for a six Doherty to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs another full ball, this time towards leg and Rohit leans forward, plays against the spin and sends it over wide long-on for another six Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs he's unleashed after the fifty! Full ball and he launched it wide of long-on for six more Maxwell to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs take that! Length delivery on the leg stump, Rohit comes out for eh crease and blasts this over deep midwicket now. He's dealing only in sixes now Doherty to Raina, OUT Doherty gets another left-hander lbw! Pitched it on length on middle, Raina put his right foot forward to defend and there's where the ball hit him, it would have hit the stumps and Raina is unhappy wit the decision for some reason Coulter-Nile to Yuvraj, SIX runs short ball, Yuvraj pulls and a top edge has gone for six! He didn't connect it at all, it wasn't timed properly as there wasn't much room and it went high up in the air but all the way over the fine leg boundary Faulkner to Yuvraj, OUT oh this is unbelievable by Haddin and Yuvraj doesn't get any respite! It was a fuller length delivery widish outside off, Yuvraj goes for a loose drive without getting anywhere near the line, gets a thick edge that Haddin plucks off his left hand with a quick reflex dive .. Stunning catch. He turns and hurls the ball in the air McKay to Rohit Sharma, OUT he comes round the wicket and bowls a full delivery on the pads and Rohit flicks it beautifully to fine leg where the fielder takes a forward diving catch. He gets a wink from McKay as he goes back, a wink of appreciation ... Australian fielders congratulate him as he trudges off the pitch..What an innings!! 6.15pm The Australia openers are out for the mammoth chase and Bhuvneshwar Kumar will bowl to Aaron Finch with two slips Vinay to Maxwell, SIX runs and Vinay Kumar gets the flavour of the day, this one is one amazing shot, he picked it up from the middle stump and sends it to the second tier at deep square leg Vinay to Watson, SIX runs now he connects and connects very very well, Watson is very serious, no smiles at all as he smashes it way way deep into the cow corner stands.. Looked like it was heading out of the ground at one stage Shami to Watson, SIX runs length delivery outside off and the batsman doesn't care what pace it is or where it's coming from, he just slaps it over the non-striker's head, it goes over long-on, it was a slower delivery too Jadeja to Watson, OUT that is the end of Watson! Jadeja hurls some words at Watson's end after the wicket, totally unnecessary! Here is what happened! It was a shorter and flatter delivery on off, the batsman went for a cut, he chops it on to Dhoni's thigh and it ricochets to lob gently for the fielder at short third man. Watson wasn't sure what happened, but he has to go. Jadeja to Faulkner, SIX runs full and closer to off, Faulkner lofts is down the ground over long-on, Rohit is running to his right and it goes through his hands for a six. Not an easy catch that one Ashwin to Faulkner, 1 wide flighted and full well outside off, another big wide Bhuvneshwar to Faulkner, SIX runs and what happens when he's on strike? It's full again, and he sends it high up in the air, it looked like a mis-hit but it's gone all the way. SIX more That's all we have for you all today, it was great to have yo here and we'll look forward to more feedback as India head to Kolkata for the Test against West Indies and Australia will go back home for the Ashes. Till then, it's goodbye from Vishal Dikshit on behalf of Devashish and scorer Binoy George. Ta ta! Player of the match is Rohit Sharma, INDIA","India 383 for 6 (Rohit 209, Dhoni 62, Dhawan 60) beat Australia 326 (Faulkner 116, Maxwell 60) by 57 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The 200-club: Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, and now Rohit Sharma BCCI It is an indictment of how skewed the contest between bat and ball has become that for 2961 ODIs, no batsman broke the 200-run barrier and now three have done it in the last 467 matches. Rohit Sharma was the latest entrant to the club, after Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, and he hit 16 sixes - a world record - during a ransacking of Australia in the deciding match of a series that bowlers on both sides will be glad to leave behind. Incredibly, Australia lost because they were out of wickets and not time. India hit 19 sixes as they racked up 383; Australia replied with 326, the ninth time in 11 innings that a team passed 300 this series. And though they lost by a sizeable margin in the end, they did not lose the six-hitting contest."
"10.15am Cook and Carberry will be in the dressing room strapping on the pads with Australia's new-ball attack eager to get at them. Will be interesting to see if there's a change of mindset from the England batsmen after the success of Ben Stokes at the WACA who showed some intent. Siddle to Carberry, 1 leg bye sliding down the leg side, attempted pull shot, with the front leg in the air, deflects off thigh pad for a leg bye Siddle to Cook, OUT pushed across, Cook nibbles and he's gone! Caught at second slip, an indecorous prod from Cook that seemed to betray the muddled state of mind he has got into with his batting, gulled into hanging his bat out and a thick edge flew to Clarke. Like a man reaching for another chocolate late on Christmas day, Cook couldn't resist temptation there Siddle to Carberry, 1 leg bye Siddle slides down the leg side and Carberry attempts a glance, the ball rolls behind square off the pads Harris to Carberry, 4 byes wayward start, round the wicket, fired down the leg side (like Mitchell on a bad day) and Haddin has no chance to reach it Harris to Carberry, 1 leg bye short of a length, straighter but still angled towards the pads, doesn't make contact with the bat as Carberry tried to work towards square leg Watson to Carberry, OUT That's right on target! Superb bowling. Followed the outswinger with the inswinger. Completely does Carberry who shoulders arms and sees the ball clip off stump. Another start not built on for him. Terrific skill from Watson Harris to Root, OUT lovely outswinger, right on the money and that's out! Root has been making half-promises and forget-me-not motions at balls outside off all innings and finally he gets something on one, pulled on to the front foot, bat dangling away from the pad and a thin but audible nick sails through to the keeper Lyon to Panesar, OUT leaves a straight one and is bowled, Lyon ties a bow on the England innings. We'll kindly call that a misjudgement from Monty, who planted the front foot and confidently lifted his bat in the air as an arm ball drifted on to rattle the top of middle and off Broad to Harris, OUT eight down! Short leg had been brought in after the previous short ball and now he takes the catch. Wasn't a full-on bouncer, instead short of a length and Harris tried to work it away but couldn't roll his wrists in time and it was a sharp grab by Root who held his nerve and didn't turn away from the shot although it didn't come very quickly. Stokes to Siddle, 1 leg bye short of a length, defects off the thigh pad towards square leg Anderson to Haddin, OUT that will do it! Dug in and chasing Haddin as he backs away, cramping an attempted pull and the ball loops off the top edge, possibly via the helmet, Bairstow jogs to backward square leg to take a comfortable catch - his fourth of the innings - and England, despite a few flutters, have wrapped up the innings with a lead of 51 Innings Start Ram: ""England last 5 for 6 and middle 3 for 1.

So there was rare joy experienced by Australia, Rogers and another bounteous MCG crowd as both events came to pass, with the considerable assistance of a staggeringly listless England. A successful chase offered vindication to Michael Clarke, who sent England in to bat in the knowledge that the drop-in pitch would improve across the match. A first Test century in Australia provided rich satisfaction for Rogers, plus the assurance that he will be on the plane for next year's South Africa tour. But another day of humiliation left England in a state of total despair, having coughed up their fourth defeat from a day three position that had looked close to impregnable."
"Bresnan to Haddin, SIX runs pitched up on off stump, belted back down the ground by Haddin, nonchalant swing of the arms and it goes into the stands Stokes to Haddin, OUT short and pulled and misues it to midwicket and England have a long-awaited breakthrough, mighty relief for them, they check the no-ball and once again Stokes is ever-so-close to the Popping crease but he's got a minuscule of a boot behind the line. It was banged in by Stokes, Haddin was hurried into pulling and spooned it to Anderson who got down to take the catch sliding forward Stokes to Johnson, 1 wide bumper but this is too short and called wide Stokes to Johnson, 1 leg bye off the thigh pad down leg side, Prior scrambled across and saves more than one Anderson to Smith, OUT this cuts through Smith as he props forward, there's a thin sound, Anderson goes up immediately... Umpire Marais Erasmus isn't convinced but England ask to review straight away. Smith stood his ground, unruffled, but we're going to find out what technology thinks Anderson to Harris, OUT pushes at a length ball in the channel and this one goes to hand, caught in the gully! Harris is cut down before he can do too much damage, another wicket for Anderson and England are close to rounding up the innings Watson to Root, OUT beats the bat again, a subtle curve away from Root as he plays forward ... Australia go up in unison and after a moment's thought, Erasmus gives it. Root, however, goes straight to the DRS, he seems certain he didn't hit it. We're getting numerous replays, can't see a mark on Hot Spot, no visible deviation. Real-Time Snicko doesn't prove anything either, though there is a sound, apparently after the ball had passed the bat. Tony Hill appears to be telling Erasmus he can't be cert Siddle to Cook, 5 wide huge bumper, right over the keeper's head, from Siddle? Apparently so. Brings the 100 up Johnson to Pietersen, 1 bye good bumper, Pietersen gets out of the way, Haddin leaps up but only parries it and they take a bye Siddle to Pietersen, OUT slightly short, Pietersen goes after Siddle - but he can't quite clear mid-on, where Johnson takes a brilliant leaping catch! Massive wicket for Australia and Siddle knows it, the veins in his temples pulsing, letting out a primal roar as the WACA goes bananas. Pietersen sticks his bat under his arm and heads off, it's the way he plays but he'll know that shot wasn't really what England needed. Superb snag by Mitchell Johnson, though Lyon to Bell, 2 leg byes extra bounce for Lyon, outside leg stump, Bell looks to glance it off his hip and it deflects via the thigh pad behind square Harris to Bell, OUT the in-ducker this time, Bell is hit on the front pad but Erasmus shakes his head... Might have been outside the line? Height could also come into it Johnson to Prior, 1 bye short and aiming at the cracks mid-pitch, bullseye for Johnson, though the results are unpredictable and Haddin has to leap to his right to get a glove on the ball as it shoots away from the batsman, manages to keep them to a single bye Innings Start","Australia 385 (Smith 111, Warner 60, Haddin 55) and 6 for 369 dec (Warner 112, Watson, Rogers 54) beat England 251 (Cook 72) and 353 (Stokes 120, Bell 60, Johnson 4-78) by 150 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details As the Barmy Army sang mournfully of their desire to take the Urn home, Australia completed a pounding of England in Perth to regain the Ashes lost in 2009. Mitchell Johnson was a fitting taker of the last wicket, a short ball to James Anderson an equally fitting manner in which to take it. England have been bullied and battered from the second afternoon in Brisbane when Johnson blew the touring middle order away. In all it has taken only 14 days for Australia to end four years of torment. Of the current team only Michael Clarke had experienced an Ashes victory before."

Australia's 298-run victory was finalised when Nathan Lyon found the edge of Umesh Yadav's bat and Brad Haddin gloved the ball cleanly, which led to celebrations from the Australians. Not wild celebrations, though."
"""You've never posted any of my comments but hopefully this one makes it through. On this tour India have won 3 of 13 tosses in all internationals, Aus 9 of 13 and SL 4 of 6. This tour has confirmed my view of the failings of using a random activity to decide such an important part of each game. I think there should only be one toss at the start of each series. The winner chooses for the first game and then it alternates. This way there is at least Praveen to Watson, OUT If you remember the CB Series final from 2008, this is almost exactly how PK got rid of Ricky Ponting. Back of a length, a hint of wobble away from the batsman. Watson goes back and looks to bang it over the leg side, but miscues it, perhaps because of the deviation away from the bat, and the pull loops gingerly to mid-on. India have struck early, Watson goes back after a short-lived comeback. Praveen to Forrest, OUT PK does it again. Slower ball from PK, he rolled the fingers over and got it to stop on Forrest and go away. Forrest tries to push to the off side, but gets a thin inside edge that drops onto the stumps. Ashwin to Wade, 1 leg bye tossed up outside leg, turned with the angle to the leg side for one. Yadav to Wade, OUT Yadav has a wicket! He can't believe his luck, he turns back and appeals after getting a healthy edge to the keeper. A bowler with pace makes a different straight away. Wade tries to open the face and steer a length ball behind square on the off side. Extra pace and bounce, forces the edge straight into Dhoni's mitts. Jadeja to Christian, 1 leg bye huge lbw shout turned down. Christian was across the stumps and looking to nudge to leg, the ball struck him in front of leg, but it was sliding down. Yadav to Hussey, OUT Yadav is on a roll. He's brought India back into this game with a twin-strike. Bowling your fastest bowler seems to be a good idea after all. Short of a length, hustled by the pace, DJ goes for the pull but the ball is through him very quickly. Another edge, straight to Dhoni, even as DJ loses his grip on the bat.. Yadav smiles, this is the first bit of good news he's had in a long time. Sehwag to Lee, OUT and now Lee is gone. Having fired a couple through, Sehwag slows this one in the air and holds it back to hoodwink Lee as he charges out of the crease. He ends up swinging his swipe across the line, and the ball goes straight to Kohli at deep square leg. A thoroughly engrossing session of play, with all the ebbs and flows that make ODI cricket fun to watch. Swing from Praveen to start off, early damage to Australia, followed by a tempered 50 from Warner. His dismissal was pivotal to the course of the game, as it put Irfan out of commission, even as it took Warner out of the equation. India had to bowl part-timers to make up the over-rate and Irfan's quota. That allowed Wade and DJ Hussey to settle Dan Brettig has it all in his innings report. You guys read that, or Sid Monga's explanation of the DJ Hussey controversy, while I check out the entire transcript of the Dhoni presser chronicles. See you on the other side of the break. Sehwag is out there with the bat now, and he's there with Tendulkar. India's best opener in the series will bat at No. 3 again. Lee to bowl. Will Sehwag line up the upper-cut straight away? Two slips. Lee to Sehwag, 1 wide you almost saw that coming. Short and wide of off stump, Sehwag goes after it, but it was so wide that even he couldn't reach it. Third man is square, and is licking his lips. Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 wide bouncer over the leg stump line, Gambhir tries to swat it away and misses. Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, 1 wide slips this one well down the leg side and it is called a wide. Hilfenhaus to Pathan, (no ball) over-steps as he delivers a full ball wide of off stump. Play and a miss, but the upcoming free-hit could help. Right then, that completes our live coverage of this game. Here is Dan Brettig's report of the day's play. We'll soon have plenty of analysis and opinion from Sid Monga in Sydney. I'll be back on Tuesday to bring you India's last league game, perhaps India's last game on this disastrous tour. Sri Lanka will start off as favourites, and will only need to deny the bonus point to confirm their spot in the finals. Until Tuesday, on behalf of the ESPNc Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 9 for 252 (Warner 68, Wade 56, D Hussey 54, Sehwag 3-43) beat India 165 (Ashwin 26, Watson 2-9) by 87 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details It was another struggle for India's batsmen on tour Getty Images India succumbed meekly to the pressure of a chase of 253 - a chase they were required to nail to remain in serious contention in the triangular series - and were bowled out for 165 by an Australia side that eagerly grabbed the chance to seal its own spot in the competition deciders. Short of a bonus-point victory in their final match against Sri Lanka and a subsequent loss to the hosts by Mahela Jayawardene's flourishing side, India will fly home earlier than desired from an Australia tour that peaked all too early with Rahul Dravid's Bradman Oration and has disintegrated steadily ever since. Australia's stand-in captain Shane Watson compensated for a poor showing with the bat by nipping out Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina, and generally led his team soundly in the field in the absence of the injured Michael Clarke. He had a bonus point victory in front of 33,639 spectators to show for it. The folding of India's batting was a familiar tale of patterns and misadventures."
"Angelo Mathews to Clarke, OUT a stunning catch and Clarke's gone. Full ball angling into the pads, Clarke swipes it efficently over midwicket, and he times it well enough to give Thisara on the boundary a chance. And how well he took it.. He ran across and to his front, tumbled forward and plucked the ball just before it hit turf. Sri Lanka will breathe easy ... Perera to Forrest, 1 wide Thisara rolls down a legspinning slower ball down the leg side. It is called a wide. Angelo Mathews to Forrest, OUT Forrest holes out, without quite indulging himself in the post-century celebrations. As always, the slower ball does the job for SL. Mathews held it back, Forrest backed away for a carve, and was early into the loft over the covers and teed it straight up in the air. Simple catch in the deep cover area. Angelo Mathews to Hussey, SIX runs murder in Tasmania. Slower ball to David, who waits and waits before blasting it across the line miles over midwicket. The slower ball can be pesky to batsmen who commit themselves early, but David Hussey isn't one of those ... Kulasekara to Hussey, SIX runs what's worse than Hussey going bonkers at one end? Hussey going bonkers at both. Kula sends down a listless full toss, which ends up in Michael's slot as he moves across and lines up a lap. He ends up timing it so well, it flies out of the park. Stunning timing. Malinga to Hussey, OUT Malinga's making his worth apparent. The inch-perfect yorker from hell, full, ram-rod straight and destined to hit the base of the stumps. Michael was looking to play the cheeky dab to third man, but he was messing with the wrong man. Wrong ball in any case. It's through him, and the bails fly off. Herath to Christian, OUT a wicket to end a splendid over under the circumstances. Herath holds the length back sending Christan's rampant charge, and slips the ball past his murderous heave to the leg side. Sanga doesn't grasp the ball cleanly, but holds on to break the furniture. Hilfenhaus to Dilshan, 1 leg bye too straight, Dilshan flicks through square leg for a single. Hilfenhaus to Dilshan, 1 leg bye full ball slipping down towards leg, Dilshan misses the flick and it goes off the pad to the off side. Dilshan has 1 off 6 in this fireworks display! Christian to Sangakkara, 1 wide starts with a ball way outside off Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT a great ball to end what was promising to become a great innings. Doherty slows up the release, gets the ball to land just short of a length outside off, grip and spin. So far, Mahela has been adept at reaching the pitch and lofting over the off side, or pushing through for singles. This time too he was looking to reach out, but was about a foot away fr Hilfenhaus to Thirimanne, 1 wide poor start, a loosener that slips yards wide of off stump. Harris to Chandimal, OUT Ryano has done the damage, Chandimal pays the price for playing strange strokes under pressure. He walks across the stumps to a straight ball and tries to dink it square. Harris kept it straight and full and rapped him dead in front of the stumps. End of a good innings, but Chandimal needs to learn how to finish the job. Christian to Perera, 1 leg bye near perfect yorker, lands outside leg and hits the pad as Perera misses the heave to leg. He was through the shot too early. Leg bye taken. The permutations can wait awhile longer. India's fates still rest in their own hands, though at the moment they are a distant third in this tournament. We'll be back for the fun on Sunday. Before you leave, here is the match report by Brydon Coverdale. We'll soon have a lot more analysis and comment from the game up on the site. On behalf of the gang, this is Nitin Sundar signing out. Cheers! Sri Lanka won by 3 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mahela Jayawardene, SL","Sri Lanka 7 for 283 (Jayawardene 85, Chandimal 80, Christian 3-53) beat Australia 6 for 280 (Forrest 104, Clarke 72) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mahela Jayawardene made 85 in Sri Lanka's successful chase Getty Images Sri Lanka sure know how to keep things interesting. On a day when Peter Forrest announced himself as Australia's new No.3 with his maiden one-day century, Mahela Jayawardene and Dinesh Chandimal helped Sri Lanka complete a record ODI chase in Hobart, where Australia's 6 for 280 wasn't enough to book them a place in the finals. Sri Lanka jumped to the top of the points table with their three-wicket victory, which came with four balls to spare. In a tense finish, Sri Lanka appeared to be throwing the match away and after Angelo Mathews holed out for 24 they needed 14 off nine balls with only three wickets in hand."
"Khan to Wade, 1 wide that wasn't too far from being a wide. Back of a length, well outside off stump and it them seams away prodigiously. Ah it was called a wide after all. Khan to Wade, 1 wide no confusion this time. Another big wide from Zaheer, and Davis call is there for all to see. Vinay to Warner, 1 leg bye Vinay strays down the leg side now from round the stumps, and Warner can't get the glance away. Dhoni trots across to field the leg bye. Vinay to Wade, 1 leg bye Wade walks right across the stumps and looks to ship, and the ball is again outside leg stump. Another leg bye taken behind square. Pathan to Warner, 1 wide that didn't swing. It landed outside leg and kept floating further down. The loosest loosener you will see, at 117 kph. Pathan to Warner, OUT Irfan has struck. Tendulkar has taken a catch, and Rohit Sharma isn't anywhere near him this time. Soft dismissal, Irfan dangles it full with no pace on the pads, and Warner contrives to chip it uppishly straight at midwicket. India will breathe easy now. Warner looke Khan to Ponting, OUT Ponting's struggle ends! He falls for the trap thanks to some intelligent field placing, drifts on the pads and he tries to loft over the leg side but ends up finding Irfan at deep backward square leg Khan to Forrest, 1 wide he loses control of that slower ball and slips it very wide outside off Rohit Sharma to Wade, OUT the bowling change works for India, Rohit cut back on the pace a bit, drew Wade forward for the chipped drive but he ended up spooning it straight back at Rohit, easy catch Rohit Sharma to Forrest, 1 wide too wide down the leg side and he fails to make contact Pathan to Christian, 1 leg bye good comeback, the yorker and he plays all around it, can't steal a leg bye Lee to Gambhir, OUT Lee has got rid of the in-form man! Peach of a delivery on the corridor outside the off stump, Gambhir was tentative on the defense, didn't move his feet across and he was beaten for a bit of extra pace too, thin edge taken by Wade Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, OUT Doherty again! But this time he hangs on to it easily! Tendulkar arches backward to a short delivery to play one of his signature shots - the upper cut over the slips and third man - didn't get the elevation and Doherty at third man barely had to move Lee to Rohit Sharma, OUT slashed and edged! Length ball outside off, Rohit is tempted to slash it away and he does by staying rooted to the crease, thick edge to Wade and Bowden raises the crooked finger and immediately cautions the batsman to wait, just to check if it was a front-foot no-b Hilfenhaus to Kohli, OUT Appeal for a catch at slip, Kohli isn't sure if that carried to David Hussey at slip, outside edge travels low to Hussey's right and the catcher was certain he took it cleanly, the umpires have a chat and refer it upstairs, from the square leg angle it looked alrig Starc to Dhoni, 1 leg bye shuffles and clips him down to square leg Starc to Raina, SIX runs about time for India, Starc pitches it up on the off stump and Raina has the space to reach out and scoop it over the sight-screen Christian to Dhoni, 1 wide full and too wide of the off stump, we've seen quite a few extras today Starc to Dhoni, 1 leg bye drifts on the body and the ball rolls to the on side off his pads Lee to Dhoni, 1 wide the slower bouncer and it's too high for Dhoni to chase Hilfenhaus to Dhoni, OUT now even 230 looks like a mirage for India, short delivery again and on the body, Dhoni tries to pull that in front of square on the on side, ends up finding Christian at midwicket, it appeared like a slower ball Lee to Vinay, 1 wide strays too wide down the leg side and wide called The debate over India's rotation will continue before their next match on Tuesday. Player of the match is Ben Hilfenhaus, AUS","Australia 5 for 288 (M Hussey 59, Forrest 52, Irfan 3-61) beat India 178 (Dhoni 56, Hilfenhaus 5-33, Lee 3-49) by 110 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Michael Hussey and Peter Forrest were involved in a century stand AFP Ben Hilfenhaus and Brett Lee splintered India to return Australia to the top of the table with a 110-run victory that reaped a bonus point at the Gabba. On a day when Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar both glimpsed their mortality in the limited-overs game, Australia's 5 for 288 proved far too tall a target for India's batsmen, who looked as uncomfortable as ever when faced by Brisbane's bounce and a home side recovering from two straight losses. Making use of a hard, fast pitch and the early swing offered by the new ball, Lee and Hilfenhaus nipped out four wickets between them to slide India to 4 for 36, and had snared eight by the end of the night. Hilfenhaus was playing his first ODI since November 2009, in place of the ill Clint McKay, and made a strong case for his retention by moving the ball at good pace on a disciplined line to take five wickets for the first time. He had an ideal counterpoint in Lee, who offered slippery pace and plenty of aggression."
"Zampa to Morgan, OUT and he gets the breakthrough! Morgan looks pretty unimpressed with himself, and so he should. He struck it well, but attempting that short with Starc stationed at mid-off was much too risky Maxwell to Bairstow, 1 wide sliding past the legs as Bairstow leaves it deliberately to coax the wide Cummins to Bairstow, 1 leg bye crashes into the pads, but too straight and too high on first impressions. No reviews left either way... Maxwell to Bairstow, 1 wide fired in flatter, outside leg, and Bairstow misses his pull as Carey wears the ball on his shoulder to gather it. Turn and bounce... Marsh to Bairstow, 1 leg bye leg-sided, England settle for another nurdle off the hip Starc to Billings, SIX runs well, no one's stopping that. It was in the slot, poor delivery, in truth. Billings rocked back and gave it a thump, and this time gets it perfectly right. Sails away past cow corner and into the car park. They might need a new ball here. Cummins to Bairstow, SIX runs that's an unbelievable shot, even more so given it brings up his hundred. Just a short-arm jab to a ball at 89 mph. So casual, and yet it clears the square leg boundary comfortably Zampa to Billings, OUT reverse sweep and Billings gives it away!. He didn't get that anywhere near the middle Cummins to Bairstow, OUT Makes the breakthrough. Rolled his fingers over it and it spins in sharply to pierce the gap between bat and pad and knock off stump back! He has to go for a magnificent century, and Australia have a bit of wind in their sails now Marsh to Woakes, 1 wide loose ball down legside Hazlewood to Tom Curran, 1 wide drags this down legside. Australia have been a bit untidy today with the extras Starc to Tom Curran, OUT gets his revenge. Sends down one of those unplayable yorkers he's the best in the world at. Got revrse swing to moves it away from the bat and clatter into the base of off stump Starc to Rashid, SIX runs Ho ho ho! That was as premeditated as they come. Rashid moves across and shows all three stumps, but smashes it over square leg. That came cleanly out of the middle, and he's joined in the fun Woakes to Finch, OUT massive appeal, bang in front! Gone! Finch doesn't blink as he turns on his heel, shaping in, thumping a pad that was positively Watto-esque in girth. That was smashing the lot, and England have their breakthrough! Root to Warner, OUT bowled him! Wow, Warner has been opened up like a can of peaches! Big spin as Warner retreated to leg to make room, but was utterly undone from a middle-and-leg line. Gripping, ripping, clipping the top of off. Wow! Who needs Archer as your nemesis, when Joe R Root to Marsh, OUT flicked across the line, is there an inside-edge on that? You bet there is! A fat deflection, onto the knee-roll, a simple lob to Buttler as he jogs round from behind the stumps. And suddenly Australia's challenge is in free-fall! Archer to Carey, (no ball) he holes out this time! Soft, soft dismissal. Oh, wait, that's a big, big no-ball. Carey survives! He had chipped that straight to third man where Adil Rashid took an easy catch, but Australia have a reprieve Root to Maxwell, SIX runs he won't rush through them now Maxwell's slapped him over his head for a colossal six. That was right in the slot, and Maxwell couldn't have asked for a better ball to clobber away Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 wide wide yorker that's a touch too wide Tom Curran to Maxwell, SIX runs doesn't matter this is a long boundary, that's clobbered to the long onside boundary. Got into position and found it was right in the slot, and picked it up and sent it the way of the car park! Wood to Maxwell, 1 wide another wide, Wood bending his back and going for it, but straight occasionally veers to the leg-side Wood to Carey, 1 leg bye thumps the pad hard on a full length, but outside leg, and deflected into space at short third man Archer to Carey, 1 wide round the wicket, fired down the leg side as Archer followed Carey's shimmy to the leg side, but overcompensated Wood to Maxwell, 1 leg bye tucked up on the back foot, but another single as Carey calls him through with the ball at his feet Wood to Maxwell, 1 run pushed back onto the stumps, flicked off the hip to backward square. That's nine off the over, and concerns for Morgan now. Woakes has been reliable, and Curran is a gun at the death. He's got six left ... and here he comes. Woakes to Maxwell, 1 leg bye thumps the pad on a leg-stump line, Buttler scuttles to limit the damage Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 run hoicked to the leg side, a bit of a biff, but it's effective enough. That six basically won the over... Rashid to Maxwell, OUT another mow, another top-edge, and that's the wicket! Oh my! Rashid went for the slow wide one, tossed right up to tempt the glory wipe... and Curran at short third man just about clung on with a juggle as he leapt forward! Archer to Carey, OUT stunning catch at third man! Mark Wood! Tumbling forward, like a mirror image of Simon Jones at Edgbaston ... swooping low, as Archer banged in the short wide one! The umpires are taking a look to make sure, but that reaction was unequivocal! Dipping out of t Australia won by 3 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 305 for 7 (Maxwell 108, Carey 106) beat England 302 for 7 (Bairstow 112, Billings 57, Woakes 53*) by three wickets Twin tons to Glenn Maxwell and Alex Carey carried Australia past a precarious start to ensure a match and series victory against England in the final ODI at Emirates Old Trafford. Their 212-run partnership rescued the tourists from 73 for 5 and resigned England to their first bilateral ODI series defeat at home since 2015. Both fell in the dying stages, leaving it to Mitchell Starc to bring up the winning runs with a cool head and a swinging bat. The result overturned Jonny Bairstow's powerful century, which had lifted England to a commanding total from their own troubled beginning. Early wickets to Chris Woakes and an inspired turn by part-time spinner Joe Root had Australia in dire trouble in their pursuit of 303 before Maxwell's 108 off 90 balls and Carey's 106 sealed the series 2-1."
"Malinga to Warner, OUT Malinga's hoodwinked Warner in some style here. The pace has yo-yoed from the mid 140s to the low 120s, without any discernible change in action. Warner wasn't spotting them, and tried to take a start down the track this time for the chip. Malinga's offcutter came in slow motion, and Warner was through the shot when it pinged the bat. Too late to properly check the shot. Warner tries to, but ends up popping it straight to Maharoof at Maharoof to Ponting, OUT and he's got him! Ponting's poor form extends. He's yet to get to 10 in this series. What a lovely slower ball that. Maharoof sucked Ponting into a drive down the ground with a 117 kph slower ball, and he played it right back at him. Maharoof put his hands up and snaffled it, this is such a fine comeback for him. Kulasekara to Wade, OUT Australia in a hole now. Wade's gone after a mix-up of epic proportions. Thisara Perera has done a Jonty Rhodes in the short cover region. Full length ball outside off, Wade pushed it into the covers, a good five yards to Thisara's right, but he moved like a panther and dived full length to gather it in his palm. Forrest saw Thisara moving and started reluctantly for the single, but chose to go full tilt after Thisara stopped it. Wa Angelo Mathews to Hussey, OUT and he's gone next ball. Mathews is beside himself with glee. He keeps this on a length just outside off, and Hussey tries to be cheeky as he plays a cut close to the body. The ball kisses the outside edge and heads straight into Sanga's gloves. Perera to Christian, OUT Another one bites the dust. Thisara has pinned Christian in front with an indipper. He was looking to get across to middle stump and work it to leg, but the ball burst through to hit the pad. Was it missing leg stump? I want to see a replay of that. Right, Hawk-Eye shows it would have missed leg stump. Herath to Hussey, 1 wide slings the first ball down the leg side, and it is called wide. Herath to McKay, OUT on your bike, young man. Classic left-arm deception from Herath, whose tossed up the left-arm spinners all over. He slyly slides in the arm ball, faster and straight from a slightly shorter length this time. McKay didn't pick it as he thrust the pad forward and played outside the line. The ball thuds into the foam in line with off, and it seems to be crashing into middle. Malinga to Starc, 5 wide The Malinga meltdown continues. He thumps down a bouncer that takes off well over the batsman and Sanga. Five wides. Horrible bowling. The rain seems to have put the radar out of operation. Maharoof to Forrest, OUT Things getting worse for Australia. At this rate, this game will be over before the rain comes. Maharoof keeps it on a nagging line just outside off, and Forrest flirts with it perilously. The ball kisses the outside edge and settles in the hands of the widish fly slip, who couldn't have been positioned more accurately. Perera to Hussey, OUT at long last, Thisara has got DJ caught deep on the off side. He should have had him with his first ball today. Another full ball angling across wide of off stump, Hussey had to reach out and try to carve it in the air. He picked out the sweeper on the off side, who took the catch well. DJ has played his part here, reviving Australia from the doldrums. They have a chance now. Sri Lanka will chase 152 to win. On the whole, Australia will be pleased with what they have done since the rain break, but Sri Lanka are still the favourites to win here. That Australia have a chance is down to David Hussey. In a sense, Australia must be relieved that there was a rain break. They would have struggled to bat out 50 overs after losing their top six cheaply, and the adjustments have cost them almost nothing in hindsight. We'll be back by about 7.45 Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide too short that bouncer. Mahela easily ducks under it. McKay to Sangakkara, 1 wide McKay tries to bowl Sanga behind the legs, but the ball is called wide as Sanga skips across. Christian to Sangakkara, 1 wide Christian's turn to keep Sanga waiting. Wide down the leg side now. Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 leg bye Mahela looks to sweep and edges onto the pad. The umpire misses it and signals leg byes. The Sri Lankans have absolutely stomped Australia here. I wonder how much more comprehensive this may have been, if David Hussey hadn't been dropped and Malinga had bowled properly in the death overs. The series is now wide open, and thank god for that. Could have been a complete bore-fest if SL lost today. Right, that winds up our coverage for today, with the series wide open. Here's hoping the second half of the league phase is just as intriguing. Dan Brettig's report is getting updated here, and we'll soon have lots of analyses from our on-field writers.

Despite the best efforts of David Hussey, the hosts were rumbled out for 158, their lowest at the ground since 1997 and fourth-lowest in all ODIs in Sydney, in a match reduced to 41 overs-per-side by a two-hour rain delay that took place when Australia were a punch-drunk 6 for 88. Tillakaratne Dilshan and the captain Mahela Jayawardene then removed all doubt about the contest with a stand of 74 inside 12 overs. Jayawardene was still there when the winning runs were collected with 16.5 overs to spare, surprising a crowd of 22,365 and pushing Sri Lanka back into finals contention with seven points after four matches."
"Vinay to Ponting, OUT the opening experiment fails for Ponting, Vinay does well to pitch it up on the off stump, moves it away slightly, Ponting drives inside out and spoons it Kohli at point, Ponting looked at bit awkward at the crease when he played that and the follow through too Yadav to Clarke, OUT not sure what Clarke was trying to do but full credit to the bowler for this, he saw Clarke making room and taking a few paces down and cleverly slipped in a slower ball at 121 kph, Clarke had to change his shot and tap it away with soft hands, had to really stretch out and he ended up chopping it onto his stumps Jadeja to Christian, 2 wide moves right across his stumps and tries to paddle it away, the ball hits Dhoni flush on the knee Khan to Hussey, OUT good reflexes from Sehwag! Zaheer fires it full on the pads and Hussey tries to work that away past square leg with his wrists, he chips it and Sehwag at square leg has to time his dive well to his right, which he does, and takes it an inch from the ground Vinay to Wade, OUT Wade's scratchy knock ends, he backs away to cart that over the on side and misses a slower ball, hits the leg stump, Wade is very frustrated for not making the most of the conditions Vinay to McKay, OUT McKay moves right across and tries to slog him, he doesn't pick the slower ball and misses it, Harris was already off the blocks so McKay had to hurry, Dhoni correctly threw it to Vinay who flicked it at the stumps, the ball deflected off the stumps and the third umpire took a look, he was a yard short Harris to Sehwag, 1 wide bangs it in short down the leg side and the umpire calls it one bouncer for the over McKay to Sehwag, OUT the opening stand is over, Sehwag is gone, an ordinary delivery from McKay, short of length ball that was slanting down the leg side, should have been easily helped away, instead Sehwag closes the face too early, leading edge results, and the ball pops up for a simple catch to point, a sign of the poor form he is in McKay to Gambhir, 1 wide too wide down the leg side and Gambhir can't chase that McKay to Gambhir, OUT the bowling change works! Lands it on leg, Gambhir had already shuffled across the stumps a bit and had exposed the leg stump, the ball nipped in slightly and hit his pads, the umpire reckoned that was hitting leg, on seeing the pitch map, the ball looked like pitching on the border of the leg stump line McKay to Raina, 1 wide strays really wide down the leg side and wide called Doherty to Dhoni, 1 wide tossed up outside the off stump and it's too wide So McKay crumbles under pressure in the final over. With 13 needed, Australia would have fancied their chances but Dhoni quietly saved his best for the last over. It was a strange old knock but in end India got home in a heart-stopper. India won by 4 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Gautam Gambhir, INDIA","India 6 for 270 (Gambhir 92, Dhoni 44*) beat Australia 8 for 269 (Hussey 72, Forrest 66) by four wickets Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details India's chase was anchored by Gautam Gambhir's fluent 92 AFP A supremely calm MS Dhoni guided India to victory, with two balls to spare, over a sluggish Australia in the ODI at Adelaide Oval. Dhoni's composure was best measured by how he paced his innings. It bordered on the statuesque early, before he raised tempo with swift running between the wickets. He saved his one stroke to the boundary - a towering six over long on - for when he most needed it: the third ball of the final over delivered by Clint McKay, which began with 13 still required. The next ball was a high full toss that Dhoni swung to deep midwicket, but the no-ball - called for height - gifted India a third run in addition to the two scampered between the wickets."
"Kulasekara to Hussey, OUT Sri Lanka have bettered their brilliance in the field, Kula ups the standards with a leaping blinder, Hussey pushed half-heartedly at a pitched up delivery, it popped in the air down the pitch to Kula's right, the bowler recovered from his followthrough to leap at the ball one-handed and did not let go of it as he land Senanayake to Hussey, SIX runs more flight, Hussey repeats the shot, with more power, with more conviction and this time Tharanga can watch it go sailing over his head for six over long off Malinga to Hussey, 1 wide slings it in full and wide outside off, called wide for width this time Malinga to Christian, 1 leg bye fired in full on leg, dribbles square off the pad Senanayake to Christian, OUT down the track to the flighted delivery, misses the heave as this one does not turn in, Sanga does not miss the take even as the ball bounces, he hops in the air as he collects and the bails are off Angelo Mathews to Clarke, OUT gone! with more than nine overs to go, Mahela takes out Clarke who is furious at getting out, he worked this length ball in the air from middle and Mahela went low to his right quickly to take the catch at midwicket Senanayake to Harris, OUT Australia continue to lose wickets, the top spinner bounces a lot outside off stump, and Harris cuts it straight to backward point Prasad to Starc, OUT taken at long off! Starc tries to clobber the length ball down the ground, ends up slicing it in front of long off, the fielder comes in, misjudges the take initially, but does well to tumble forward and grab it in the end Prasad to McKay, OUT outstanding catch in the deep ends the innings, McKay had backed away, Prasad angled the short ball in, McKay smoked it off the middle of the bat, it seemed headed for six over deep midwicket but Thirimanne came screaming in to his left, and reached out with both hands to pouch the ball just as it was about to sail over the India almost made a mess of a similar target against Sri Lanka on this ground a couple of days ago before a seventh wicket stand got them through.

The selectors had consciously chosen a squad that blended fresh faces with veterans and while Wade top-scored, David Hussey's brisk fifty, a fast 45 from Michael Hussey and a pair of blinding catches from Ricky Ponting were key factors in the win.

Australia pushed their score up to 5 for 216 after a shaky start and the total remained unchanged under Duckworth-Lewis, but it was the sort of target India should have felt was achievable. But two early wickets to Mitchell Starc, followed by a pair of strikes in Clint McKay's first over left India expecting too much of MS Dhoni and the lower order."
"Vinay to Warner, 1 wide he's lucky again, Vinay sprayed this one far down leg side, Dhoni had to dive full length to his right to prevent five wides Praveen to Warner, OUT caught at deep square leg! Warner took on Praveen, trying to pull off the front foot and clear what is a huge boundary. He didn't make proper contact and sent the ball soaring. Gambhir back-pedaled to get into position and judged the catch well a few yards in from the boundary Praveen to Marsh, OUT edged and juggled once, juggled twice and finally caught! Marsh pushes forward at a delivery that slants across him and edges to Virender Sehwag's left at first slip. Sehwag fumbles on the first attempt and tumbles, as he tumbles he reaches out to tap the ball further in the air, so Dhoni, who moved to his left, can take the catch Praveen to Finch, 1 wide Praveen strays down leg side, Finch misses the glance Ashwin to Wade, 1 wide that's a quicker ball down leg side Jadeja to Hussey, 1 wide strays down leg side, that's a wide Jadeja to Hussey, OUT caught and bowled! Hussey's popped one straight back to the bowler, one of the easier return chances Jadeja will take in his career. He slower the pace on the ball and it stopped on Hussey as he tried to drive on the leg side Sharma to Marsh, OUT that is a lightning stumping from Dhoni. He collected the ball so close to the bails that he barely had to move to take them off, just a mere push forward. Marsh had stretched forward to drive on the off side and dragged his back foot out of his crease just a little Vinay to Wade, OUT a direct hit from cover and Wade's gone! The ball was full outside off, Wade drove it with power along the ground to Rohit Sharma, who was in the circle. He fielded cleanly and, seeing that Lee had sent Wade back, took his time, lined up the stumps and threw them down. Wade dived full length but it wasn't enough Vinay to McKay, OUT edged and caught! McKay pokes at a good length ball that leaves the right-hander and Dhoni dives to his right to take a low catch Sharma to Hogg, OUT Hogg moved across his stumps to work the ball on the leg side but was trapped plumb by a fuller ball Sehwag and Gambhir are out there, beginning this chase. Brett Lee stands at the top of his mark, he's going to steam in from over the wicket. Gambhir to face ... Marsh to Dhoni, 1 wide short ball down leg side, Dhoni swivels and tries to pull but can't make contact 10.50 pm No major celebrations from Gambhir and Dhoni, a shake of the hands and smiles as they walk off the MCG. India won this game pretty comfortably, and the victory was built by a superb fielding effort that began with Gambhir taking a good catch to dismiss Warner. Gambhir then held the chase together with a measured half-century. He'd be a favourite for Man of the Match but I'd give it India won by 8 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Ravindra Jadeja, INDIA","India 2 for 135 (Gambhir 56*) beat Australia 131 (Finch 36, Praveen 2-21) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Praveen Kumar got things started for India, with two wickets in the third over Getty Images India finally broke through for their first win of the tour thanks to a dazzling display in the field. Ravindra Jadeja provided the spark - and did no harm to his chances in Saturday's IPL auction - with a pair of run-outs as Australia's batsmen were constricted by intense pressure from the fielders, and were dismissed in the 20th over for 131. That was always going to be hard to defend and so it proved, India reaching the target with two balls to spare and eight wickets in hand to draw the series 1-1. They began the chase needing only a fraction above six an over and as a result spent much of their innings in cruise control, Gautam Gambhir able to amble along at less than a run a ball without ever letting the pressure build. The only time a hint of worry might have entered the Indian camp was when five dot balls came towards the end of the chase, and George Bailey had all his fielders in the ring in the final over with one run required."
"Ashwin to Warner, SIX runs Ashwin stops at the crease jusgt before delivery, doesn't confuse Warner as he gets on his knee and lofts over the sight-screen Ashwin to Birt, OUT low full toss outside the off stump, Birt makes room to try and slice it over the infield on the off side and he ends up spooning it hard to cover, sharp catch Raina to Wade, OUT quicker delivery and much flatter, Wade exposes his stumps and is totally cramped for room as he tries to cut, loses his leg stump, end of a blistering knock Sharma to Hussey, OUT Hussey aims for the big slog but Rahul pushes it flatter and on the stumps, swing and a miss and it hits the timber Sharma to Marsh, 1 leg bye another quick and flat delivery and Marsh swings and the ball clips his pads and rolls to the off side Lee to Sehwag, OUT didn't take Australia too long to strike! Sehwag completely squared up outside the off stump, pacy delivery and he gets a thick leading edge that lobs to Hussey at first slip, Sehwag tries to work that to the on side Lee to Gambhir, 1 leg bye nudges it off the hips down to short fine leg and they set off for a quick single Lee to Kohli, 1 wide down the leg side again and Kohli glances at the umpire, wide called this time Hussey to Gambhir, OUT soft dismissal! Extra flight from Hussey, Gambhir makes a bit of room to carve it with the turn over the infield on the off side but he scoops it inside out to Marsh at cover Hogg to Kohli, OUT Warner takes it at the edge of long-on! Hogg drops it a bit short and Kohli stays back and pulls, he realises instantly that he may not have got the required distance, Warner jogs back at long-on and doesn't have to look back, Hogg take Hussey to Rohit Sharma, OUT Rohit falls first ball! Hussey bowls from round the wicket, bowls it flat and quick, lands on middle, spins towards the pads, he tries to tuck it but leaves a gap, the ball deflects off his pads and onto the stumps Christian to Raina, OUT not too sure where Raina was trying to hit that, he made room to a delivery angling across him from over the wicket, tried to swing him across the line instead of going over the off side, inside edge crashes onto the stumps Christian to Ashwin, 1 leg bye clips his pads and rolls to the on side as he tries to flick it away The teams head to Melbourne for the second and final T20, on Friday.

Watched by a crowd of 59,659, the largest ever for a cricket match in Sydney, Australia's new Twenty20 captain George Bailey enjoyed the winner's plaudits in his first match, just as Dave Gregory had done in the very first Test in 1877 when he was the last Australian to make his debut as captain. His ingenuity in the field rather contrasted with India's captain, MS Dhoni. In the penultimate over, with the target well out of reach, Dhoni's bat flew from his hands as he attempted to make a defiant swing at Brett Lee. The tour has gone the same way, and it did not improve in the format of the IPL."
"Toss: West Indies have won the toss and they will bat first. They have made three changes. Santokie, Bonner and Darren Bravo make way for Samuels, Fidel Edwards and Danza Hyatt. McKay to Charles, 1 wide attempted slower delivery but sprays it wide outside off Watson to Smith, 1 leg bye slower delivery hits him on the pads but down the leg side, Watson appeals Watson to Charles, OUT Charles tries to go downtown over the sight screen, makes room and it looked like there was a change of pace, couldn't clear long-off, Christian takes the catch Lee to Pollard, OUT that's a massive wicket for Australia, Lee continues to keep it a bit short of a length and Pollard is cramped for room outside off, tries to dab it to third man but gets a faint outside edge to the keeper Pattinson to Smith, 1 wide attempted yorker but wide down the leg side, fast yorker though Doherty to Smith, SIX runs Smith has some lucrative deal with that on-side! Flighted and he gets on his knee and smacks it over deep midwicket Doherty to Smith, OUT Smith goes for another big hit, he made room and tries to loft him over the sight-screen but turned the face of the bat and couldn Watson to Sammy, 1 wide misdirects the slower ball down the leg side McKay to Sammy, OUT soft dismissal for Sammy, McKay bowls the slower one outside off, Sammy was at the crease trying to swing it away over the on side but ended up getting an inside edge that pegged back the middle stump McKay to Hyatt, OUT the captain sets a good example! Hyatt doesn't pick a slower ball bowled from the back of the hand, makes room and sends the ball skywards, it swirls in the air for a long time and Bailey cupped it in the region of mid-off and went tumbling back Lee to Baugh, OUT Baugh backs away to smash that over the off side but gets a thick outside edge to the keeper, quite a soft dismissal, Lee pitched the ball up a bit Watson to Bravo, OUT another wheel comes off, makes room to a length delivery and swings across the line, didn't get the timing or the elevation and finds Christian at long-on Lee to Narine, OUT jams out a full delivery towards the right of mid-off and risk the single, there' s a direct hit by Bailey and Narine is yards short, looked obvious at first glance but the third umpire had a look Lee to Edwards, OUT West Indies fail to bat out the overs! Lee fires in an inswinging yorker on middle stump, too good for Edwards who makes room and misses, the bails are all over the place Edwards to Hussey, 1 wide well outside off and the batsman can't get anywhere near that Samuels to Wade, OUT caught and bowled! It was basically a full toss and Wade smacked it straight back at Samuels, who anticipated the catch and took it comfortably moving to his right. But hold on, they're checking whether was a no-ball on height ... No, it was close but he's been given out That's it from me - have a great weekend and do join us for the first Test, which starts on Saturday April 7. Bye!

Dwayne Smith and Johnson Charles started the day with a strong, aggressive opening partnership and despite Australia's bowlers fighting back to dismiss West Indies for 160, it proved to be sufficient for the hosts as Australia's batsmen stalled in the chase after David Warner's quick opening. Too much was left for the final few overs for Australia, who needed 50 from the last five overs and then 19 from the last six balls, bowled by Dwayne Bravo. David Hussey was the only specialist batsmen left at the crease but he couldn't launch the boundaries required off Bravo, who picked up two wickets in that final over as Australia fell well short of their target. Hussey was caught at deep midwicket for 19 trying to clear the boundary and Clint McKay was bowled next ball by Bravo, who finished with 2 for 27 from his four overs and changed the course of the match by running out Warner with a direct hit from side-on."
"Lee to Charles, 1 wide woosh, that's swung almost off the strip - Charles bends double trying to get the toe of his bat on it in vain Lee to Smith, OUT slightly short again and this time Smith perishes! Lee slung a fast delivery well outside off, the batsman tried to cut but got just a sliver of bat on it, Matt Wade taking a comfortable catch Watson to Charles, OUT pitched up, misses with a swipe across the line ... gone! Watson didn't do anything spectacular with that delivery but it was on target and that's sometimes all you need. Charles goes lbw after a colourful cameo Christian to Bonner, OUT bowled him, top of middle! Another wicket for Christian and the wheels are falling off for West Indies! Bonner's somewhat ponderous innings ends with a skip down the wicket, missing with his attempted swipe and seeing his bails go pop Christian to Bravo, OUT lofted drive and taken at long-off. Bravo doesn't have quite the same muscle as Pollard and he got under a punched shot off a length ball, unable to clear the man in the deep Lee to Pollard, 1 leg bye superb ball from Lee, yorker-length and hitting Pollard's back leg outside leg stump, the ball rebounding behind point Lee to Sammy, OUT holes out to long-off! Pitched up by Lee, again well outside off, Sammy wasn nowhere near the pitch and his heave down the ground came off the bottom of the bat Santokie to Hussey, 1 wide loses his line down the leg side Santokie to Watson, SIX runs pitched up on the legs - cutting his fingers over the ball to take the pace off - but Watson fetches it into the crowd at deep midwicket, a lovely clean hit, whipping his wrists through the ball Mathurin to Hussey, 1 wide spears it down the leg side Santokie to Watson, SIX runs full, on the leg stump, scooped high over deep midwicket. Watson has taken a liking to Santokie's slightly odd style of delivery ... Mathurin to Watson, OUT shorter this time and Watson gets under it, looping the ball high out to deep midwicket again but this time it's not got the legs and Kieron Pollard pouches. West Indies get the breakthrough they need - but is it too late? That, folks, is your lot. Join me for the second and deciding match on Friday. After all, what else will you have on?

Kieron Pollard's 20-ball fifty, the fastest by a West Indian player in a Twenty20 international, proved to be in vain as the target of 151 was easily overhauled by the Australians with 11 balls to spare. West Indies were left to rue their slow start, and in particular their struggle to rotate the strike in the first half of their innings after Darren Sammy won the toss and chose to bat. It was not until Pollard arrived at the crease that their run-rate started to lift but he ran out of time, finishing unbeaten on 54 from 26 deliveries, and Australia's innings was more complete than that of their opponents. Australia lost David Warner in the first over of the chase when he tried to flick Krishmar Santokie through the leg side and was bowled by an excellent ball that angled in and then straightened, but that was the only early success for West Indies."
"Sammy to Warner, 1 wide strays wide of the leg stump and wide called Narine to Warner, OUT but revenge is a swift as it is sweet! Narine gets his man! This one was just held back a little, Warner suffered a rush of blood to the head and swatted in ungainly fashion across the line, only to loop a thick top edge to short third man. A victim of his own success there, Warner, but credit to Narine for continuing to tos Russell to Forrest, 1 wide bouncer, Forrest ducks, though he needn't of bothered - wide on height Russell to Watson, OUT and now they have one! Russell rolled a bouncer out of his hand and Watson opened the face and guided it to third man like it was on a string. There just wasn't enough pace on it to go all the way ... and Watson, like Warner, fails to go on Russell to Bailey, 1 bye leg-stump bouncer that veers even further in the air and Carlton Baugh channels Peter Schmeichel to fingertip the ball round the post/prevent a boundary Roach to Bailey, OUT Roach gets a wicket off a full toss, lucky break for the West Indies, Roach angles it in, Bailey tries to clear the infield off a low full toss, can't beat Russell at mid-on, easily taken Narine to Lee, OUT through the gate! Looked like the off cutter, landed on middle and turned in slightly, clipped the pad and hit the stumps, Lee left a big gap between bat and pad, Roach ran across to congratulate Narine and he ran quite close to Lee Roach to Hussey, 1 wide drifts wide down the leg side and he tries to flick it away Russell to Forrest, OUT the bowling change works for West Indies, Russell bowls a length ball which rises, short enough to pull but Forrest ends up placing it straight to Roach at midwicket Russell to Hussey, OUT and Russell is on a hat-trick! He gets David Hussey with a snorter, short delivery which fizzes past the batsman and forces him to weave backwards, Hussey tries to upper cut him over third man but the ball hits the face of the bat and the keeper takes it easily Samuels to Wade, 1 wide fires it wide down the leg side, fails to get bat on it Russell to Wade, SIX runs bangs it in short and Wade swivels and clubs it just over Pollard's reach at deep square leg, just enough elevation Russell to Hussey, OUT Russell has something to shout about after the hammering, change of pace, slower ball, Hussey makes room and tries to clear deep midwicket but Pollard's there Roach to McKay, OUT McKay makes a lot of room to swing a short delivery over the on side, didn't time it well and the ball swirled to deep midwicket, Darren Bravo ran forward to take the catch Roach to Wade, OUT Bravo takes another! This time just inches off the ground, Wade makes room and tries to slap it over deep cover, the ball dips to Bravo and he gets his fingers underneath it even as his hands were touching the turf Roach to Hilfenhaus, 1 bye makes room and swings and they scramble a bye, Baugh's throw is to the bowler, Roach breaks the stumps but he's in 1.50pm: The clouds have reappeared at the end of the innings. Ground staff are ready. Not a bad comeback by West Indies but Australia should be pleased with this. It's going to challenge the hosts. If Duckworth-Lewis comes into play, chasing could be more of a challenge. But West Indies are high on confidence. Russell's four wickets and dynamic fielding Hilfenhaus to Barath, 1 wide angled across and drifting down the leg side Hilfenhaus to Bravo, 1 wide down the leg side, wrong line to the lefty McKay to Bravo, OUT he's gone, feathering through to the keeper! Bravo's struggles had been masked by the giddy hitting at the other end but, after scratching around for 20 deliveries, Bravo attempted another glide to third man and nicked off. He's out of there and West Indies slide further into trouble ... Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs that's the Pollard we know! Tossed up outside off and he stays at the crease and lofts crisply just over the wide long-off fielder Lee to Baugh, OUT a collision! Wade unfortunately has hurt himself! Ouch, that will sting. Baugh tried to go for broke over the leg side, not sure where he was aiming but he got a top edge that swirled high down to fine leg, it was Hilfenhaus' catch all the way but Wade ran across from his position, two fielders claiming it, Hilfy managed to hang Lee to Sammy, SIX runs my, oh my, Sammy has dumped Lee into the car park over deep midwicket! It was another rank full-bunger and the West Indies captain connected sweetly as he hefted through the on side. Why is he coming in at No. 9?! McKay to Sammy, SIX runs another massive heave from Sammy, swinging across the line and sending McKay over wide long-on McKay to Sammy, SIX runs that's a monstrous blow and it takes Sammy to the brink of fifty from 19 balls! McKay tried to get it up in the blockhole but Sammy got right underneath it and hammed the ball over deep midwicket. Carnage! Doherty to Russell, OUT forward press on the stumps, Australia appeal for lbw - they're going to review it. The question is whether it was bat or pad first ... the side camera angle suggests pad, and the ball was going on to hit ... Russell is gone and Doherty has claimed a potentially crucial wicket! Russell goes for a rapid 41, ending a century Lee to Sammy, SIX runs he goes again, another six! Play it again, Sammy! Lee sent down a slow bouncer but Sammy read it, stayed back in the crease and hoicked the ball over deep square leg Hilfenhaus to Sammy, OUT full, heaved away into the leg side once again ... but this time he finds a fielder. Sammy perishes in the deep and West Indies suffer heroic defeat! He swung hard but this time without quite the same venom, looping a high catch to Mike Hussey at deep square leg. A valiant innings from the captain but his side fall short That, folks, is a wrap. Cheers for your comments, we'll be back for more of the same for the first of two T20 internationals on Tuesday. Player of the match is Daren Sammy, WI","Australia 281 for 9 (Warner 69, Watson 66, Forrest 53, Russell 4-61, Roach 3-53) beat West Indies 251 (Sammy 84, Lee 3-42) by 30 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brett Lee's early strikes set Australia on the winning path Associated Press Somehow, a 2-2 draw seemed a fitting result for a series that was so closely fought. That was the outcome after Australia's best all-round performance of the tour so far finished in a 30-run win, although the West Indies captain Darren Sammy did his best to carry the hosts home on his shoulders with a powerful 84 that gave his team unexpected hope. But in the end, Australia had more performers: half-centuries to David Warner, Shane Watson and Peter Forrest set up a big total of 281 for 9 and Brett Lee led a disciplined bowling display to wrap up the victory. It left the series with a sense of symmetry: it began with an Australian win, then a West Indian victory, then a tie, then a West Indies win and ended as it started, with an Australian victory. It must also have left both teams unsatisfied, Australia at their inability to gel through the middle of the series and beat the No."
"Toss, 9am This is a surprise. Australia have won the toss and Shane Watson has decided to bowl. The pitch in St Vincent was so spinner and slow-ball friendly that batting first was the way to go. I wonder if this surface is different. Lee to Charles, 1 wide the first ball is down leg side, Charles lets it pass. Lee's unhappy with that call because it may have clipped the thigh pad as the batsman let it go McKay to Barath, OUT caught behind! McKay, like he so often does, has picked up the wicket. The ball pitched on a good length just outside off and seamed away from the right-hander. It bounced a bit more as well. Barath stayed in his crease and prodded away from his body, getting a thick edge to Wade McKay to Samuels, 1 wide that's wide outside off stump, Samuels goes after it with a flamboyant front-foot cover drive, reaching far away from his body, he makes no contact Watson to Charles, 1 leg bye length, on the stumps, tickled towards midwicket Lee to Samuels, OUT the lights finally go out for Samuels! The watching world can sleep easy ... Lee fizzed one through, Samuels fenced and got the thinnest of nicks through to Wade. I can't see that disappointing the crowd too much - a scratchy innings has scratched its last Hilfenhaus to Bravo, 1 wide loses his line down the leg side - not the best start Doherty to Charles, OUT the St Lucia crowd falls silent: Charles has holed out to long-on. It was a length ball and Charles skipped out eagerly to meet it but his slog didn't quite come off the middle - the ball ending up in Brett Lee's middle as he took a jumping catch on the boundary Doherty to Bravo, OUT Dwayne Bravo faces a review first ball ... and he's gone! Doherty tossed one up around leg stump, Bravo leaned forward with his bat against his pad. The ball thunked just below the knee roll - and replays showed it would have gone on to break the wicket. That's two in two for Doughy! Watson to Bravo, OUT Bravo's been caught! He drove hard at a length ball angling across him, playing away from his body, trying to hit on the up and through the line. He ended up slicing it high in the air towards the edge of the circle at cover. There was a fielder steaming in from the deep but David Hussey ran back from the in-field McKay to Pollard, 1 leg bye tries to flick a one that's nearly in the blockhole off his pads but doesn't make proper contact Watson to Russell, OUT caught at extra cover! Watson bowled a full ball outside off stump, Russell stayed in his crease and drove hard, he made good contact, hitting the ball well but in the air towards Bailey, who took the catch to his left McKay to Pollard, SIX runs watch out in the stands beyond deep midwicket! McKay's back of the hand slower ball is too short and it sits up for Pollard, who wallops it flat over the boundary with a powerful pull Lee to Pollard, OUT he's gone this time, the delivery was fuller outside off and Pollard swung hard at it, slicing it in the air towards deep cover where Hussey ran in and took the catch. Pollard's played a special innings and he gets a warm ovation from this crowd Lee to Sammy, SIX runs Sammy's pulled a short ball and what's happened there? The ball went high in the air and cleared Forrest on the boundary. He's not having much joy out there Bravo to Forrest, 1 wide Forrest's first ball is a bouncer but it is too high Bravo to Hussey, 1 wide Bravo strays down leg side Roach to Bailey, 1 wide down the leg side, Bailey can't get anything on it Russell to Hussey, OUT caught down the leg side and the umpire Brathwaite gives it out after a long thought! Russel pitched short of a length and Hussey tried to pull, the ball was too close to the body and he was cramped for room, he ended up edging it to the keeper. Russel and Baugh appealed confidently and eventually the finger wen Samuels to Hussey, 1 wide slides down leg side with his first ball Pollard to Wade, OUT gone! Wade slogs high into the St Lucia sky and is caught at long-off! It was a pitched up delivery, outside off but Wade could only get underneath it. After his contribution with the bat, Pollard has secured a key breakthrough with his loping medium pace. This will be known as Pollard's ODI in years to come Roach to Lee, (no ball) ouch! Roach bowls a beamer that strikes Lee flush on the glove. It's a no-ball and Roach goes down the wicket to apologise ... Lee jerked away from that like he'd been scalded. He dropped his bat as the ball struck his left hand, then dropped to his knees. He initially walked away from Roach, as if to compose Russell to Lee, SIX runs another one goes the distance! This time straight down the ground, rather than over long-on. Holy Moly Narine to Hilfenhaus, 1 wide dragged down the leg side Roach to Lee, OUT gives it the old heave-ho again but this time Lee can't clear long-off. That's it, West Indies have won! Roach removes Lee by legitimate means - though he probably regrets winding him up in the first place. A heroic innings from Lee, his best score in ODIs, but the task proved beyond him and his team-mates And with that, we'll be signing off. Thanks for your comments and have a good morning/afternoon/night. Join us for the fifth and final ODI on Sunday ... Cheerio! Player of the match is Kieron Pollard, WI","West Indies 294 for 7 (Pollard 102, Barath 41) beat Australia 252 all out (Lee 59, Hussey 57) by 42 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kieron Pollard scored his second ODI hundred with a brutal display of power hitting in St Lucia Associated Press Kieron Pollard at his most brutal left Australia with an insurmountable challenge at the Beausejour Stadium in St Lucia as West Indies took a 2-1 lead with one to play in an ODI series that is rivalling their wildest dreams. Pollard produced a memorable display of power hitting, 102 slugged from 70 balls to vanquish an Australian side that West Indies had come to regard as virtually unbeatable. After a demoralising run against Australia of 13 defeats in 14 ODIs (the other being a no-result), West Indies now have two wins and a tie from their last three games. No side had ever scored more on this ground batting second than West Indies' 284 for 5 to beat England in 2004 and Australia had little chance to buck the trend once they had lost half their side for 112. That they got so close owed much to a considered half-century by David Hussey and a wrathful late assault by Brett Lee, who was struck on the arm by a beamer from Kemar Roach and, despite fulsome apologies, was sore enough in mind and body to take 24 from Roach's next over, following three fours with two sixes flayed over long-on."
"Starc to Bairstow, OUT edged, gone! 90mph/145kph, pushed across the right-hander, and Bairstow nicks off. Starc had been hooping the ball into the batsmen but this one held its line and took the edge of Bairstow's apologetic prod. Australia get their breakthrough Marsh to Root, 1 leg bye fuller sliding down leg, misses the flick but it takes the pad to backward square leg and they get a single Zampa to Root, OUT caught at slip. The move works, both to bring in Zampa and to have a slip for the right-hander. Nicely tossed up, Root's taking a step forward, but the ball dips before he can get to the pitch and turns just enough to take the outside edge. Smart take from Finch, to his right. Cummins to Buttler, OUT trapped in front but Buttler reviews immediately. Inside edge? After moving the last one away, Cummins brought this one back in. Buttler was pushing at it and it beats his bat. No inside edge. Hits in line and umpire's call on hitting the stumps! Buttler will have to go, what a great bowling change once again from Finch. Zampa to Morgan, OUT huge shout not given and Finch reviews. Great loop on this, pitches on a length on middle and turns past his forward defensive to hit him on the knee roll. and it's three reds so that's a fabulous review and an extremely critical wicket. Excellent bowling. Drew him forward, got the ball to dip and turn enough to beat bat but not enough to be missing the stumps Zampa to Billings, OUT chopped on! Billings gave himself room to cut but this was too straight and cramped him for room. A flat legbreak, just a hint of turn and it zipped through, taking the bottom edge and diverted onto the stumps. Slightly fuller than Billings anticipated Starc to Sam Curran, OUT nicks him off! Or does he? Gough, standing in his first game since the third Test vs Pakistan, isn't sure if it carried through to Carey. Starc ran his fingers down the side of this, hitting a length on fifth stump, and drew an outside edge as Curran looked to steer towards third man. The catch is a tight call, but it looks like it's going to be given, as Carey had just about got his gloves under the ball. Curran Hazlewood to Woakes, OUT length ball in the channel, and Woakes is the latest man to nick off! Classic Hazlewood, banged in on a length on fourth or fifth stump, and there's just a fraction of movement away off the seam. That's enough to take the edge as Woakes shapes to punch through the covers, and Carey gobbles up an easy chance. England reeling at 149 for 8! Cummins to Rashid, 1 wide short ball, which Rashid ducks underneath, and Saggers says it's too far down the leg side, much to Cummins' chagrin Cummins to Rashid, SIX runs banged in, back of a length, and Rashid swats at it, sending it over the rope for six! Didn't quite get up as he'd have liked, and Rashid cleared the front leg, hooking towards the shorter boundary. The wind carried it over Labuschagne on the rope, and it's half a dozen more! Marsh to Tom Curran, 1 wide slower ball bouncer at the left shoulder, Curran swings at it but can't get bat on it. Gough has a long think, and belatedly calls wide Archer to Stoinis, OUT that is just amazing fast bowling Short leg was put in place so the batsman was expecting a short one, but Archer is so quick and so accurate that he manages to get a wicket with a short ball anyway. Banged in back of a length and hisses up like a cobra towards Stoinis who is all in a tangle against that. Fends awkwardly and it takes the shoulder of the bat to loop up for an easy catch behind him. Archer's bowling w Sam Curran to Labuschagne, 1 wide loopy bouncer outside the off stump at 84mph/135kph. Labuschagne lets it go, and it's called wide Archer to Labuschagne, 1 leg bye cross-seamer which nips away from Labuschagne as he looks to work to leg. He yelps in pain as he is struck on the back thigh pad, and Archer lets out a wry smile Woakes to Labuschagne, OUT trapped on the pad, Woakes lets out a desperate appeal but Gough says no. Morgan reviews immediately. This struck both pads as he looked to work a length ball to leg, but crucially hit the front one first. No bat, Ultra-Edge confirms. Hits him in line, and would have smashed into middle two-thirds of the way up! Marnus has to trudge off, and Woakes has the breakthrough Tom Curran to Cummins, 1 leg bye back of a length on leg stump, takes the pads to roll towards leg gully Rashid to Hazlewood, 1 leg bye quick single taken. Tossed up googly that Hazlewood didn't read, was trying to tickle it fine, goes into the offside Player of the match is Jofra Archer, ENG","England 231 for 9 (Morgan 42, Zampa 3-36) beat Australia 207 (Finch 73, Labuschagne 48, Woakes 3-32, Archer 3-34, S Curran 3-35) by 24 runs England's bowlers answered every question asked of them to snatch an unlikely victory and level the series 1-1 as Australia capitulated in the second ODI at Emirates Old Trafford. Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer gave England every hope of avoiding their first bilateral ODI series defeat at home since 2015 by claiming three crucial wickets each before Sam Curran chimed in with three wickets of his own after a staggering Australian collapse to seal the win and keep the series alive going into Wednesday's final encounter. Aaron Finch and Marnus Labuschagne put on 107 for the third wicket to build on the solid foundation set by Australia's bowlers, who restricted England until a late partnership worth 76 between Rashid and Tom Curran gave the hosts something to bowl at. Chasing 232 for victory after England had won the toss, Australia stumbled to 37 for 2 and then lost four wickets in the space of 21 balls - three of them to Woakes - to give England more than a sniff of the victory which had seemed so distant after their performance with the bat and again when Finch and Labuschagne were cruising. Archer defied a used pitch which had been keeping low with devastating speed and bounce in an excellent five-over opening spell which delivered 2 for 22."
"Sammy to Warner, OUT this time the edge finds a man and Warner is gone! He leaned into a cover drive but the ball didn't quite reach him as quickly as he expected, Warner stretching and the ball flying off the toe to the safe hands of Pollard at point Roach to Hussey, 1 leg bye outside leg, pushed through midwicket Samuels to Bailey, OUT swings hard on the pull - but he's sent it straight into the hands of square leg! It was a clean connection but unfortunately for Bailey he picked out Dwayne Bravo, who coolly pockets the ball Samuels to Hussey, OUT got him! Cannily done by Samuels, dragging his length down as Hussey advanced, getting a bit of bounce past the bat and leaving Hussey stranded. Baugh does the handiwork Roach to Hussey, OUT Another one goes - a fabulous slower ball from Roach castles the younger Hussey! The batsman backed away, aiming for a swipe down the ground, but Roach rolled his fingers over it, the ball dying as it reached the crease before spinning into middle stump, half way up Roach to Lee, OUT two in the over! Lee plays on! Roach sent down another slower ball, this not as well-directed, but the pace did for Lee who was through his windy drive too quickly, getting a thick bottom edge on to the timbers Roach to McKay, 1 leg bye steered into the leg side Roach to Christian, OUT Darren Bravo shows footballing skills Dwight Yorke would be proud of to run out Doherty! Christian dropped it short on the off side, Bravo hared in and side-footed the ball into the stumps from about six yards. GOOOOOAL! Narine to Christian, SIX runs this time he connects! That's huge six - though he was nowhere near the pitch. He simply stood and smoked it over long-on Narine to Christian, OUT Christian is given out lbw - but he calls for the review. It hit the batsman full on the toe, in front of leg stump. Christian was hoping it was sliding down leg ... but it didn't have far to go and the replays suggest the ball would have thunked into the stump. He has to walk and West Indies have rounded up the last six 1.05pm: That's a quite remarkable comeback from West Indies, after toiling for so long in the heat of the Hussey-Bailey axis.They claimed the first three wickets for 58 and the last seven for 50 - but the filling in Australia's sandwich was pretty meaty. Have the hosts' bowlers done enough for the batsmen to win it? Find out with me and George in about We're all set to begin. Johnson Charles and Kieran Powell to open for West Indies. Brett Lee with the new ball, from over the wicket. West Indies will need to score the highest total of the series to win this game. Australia are playing the extra spinner today as well. It won't be easy for the hosts. Doherty to Powell, SIX runs shot! Powell goes down the pitch, didn't get to the pitch of the ball but still hoisted it off his pads over the midwicket boundary Doherty to Powell, OUT he's been stumped now! He came down the track again, once again didn't get to the pitch of the ball, and was beaten by the straighter one. He pushed forward to try and defend but was beaten as the ball skidded past his outside edge. Wade whipped off the bails with the batsman well short Watson to Samuels, OUT that looks plumb lbw and the umpire agrees. Samuels is on his way, he's decided not to review. Watson pitched full and straight, Samuels defended from his crease, as he usually does. He missed and was hit around the knee roll on the back pad. Absolutely plumb. That held its line instead of angling into the right-hander Lyon to Charles, SIX runs that is a colossal hit into the stands beyond long-off, Charles came down the track, wasn't to the pitch of the ball, but still swung hard, freeing his arms. He made good contact and timed it beautifully Lee to Pollard, SIX runs full toss and BOOMED out of the ground! Pollard set his shoulders and swung straight through the line, sending the ball whistling back over Lee's head - and over the roof of the stand at long-on Lyon to Russell, 1 leg bye straighter line, pops up off the pitch and loops past short leg off a pad Christian to Baugh, 1 wide fuller length but the line is down leg side Watson to Baugh, 1 leg bye shorter length angling into the body, Baugh fends towards square Doherty to Baugh, 1 wide he's fired that down leg side and Wade yelps in pain because that ball's smacked him on the knee cap Watson to Russell, (no ball) Watson's 150th wicket is likely to be a game-breaking one. The pressure tells on Russell, he backs away and slogs at a good length and straight ball. He misses and Watson hits the stumps. Russell begins to walk off but then waits, the umpire wants to check if Watson has over stepped. He has! Huge break for West Ind Lee to Narine, OUT splendid catch at short cover! David Hussey throws the ball in the air in celebration. Length delivery angling into the right-hander from round the wicket, Narine drove at it and hit the ball on the up, he middled it but the ball went straight to Hussey who took a low catch 5.30 pm West Indies were out of this contest having lost five wickets for very little but they've fought back admirably. They couldn't quite get over the line though, so the series remains 1-1 with two to play. Match tied Player of the match is Michael Hussey, AUS","Australia 220 (M Hussey 67, Bailey 59, Narine 3-32) tied with West Indies 220 (Charles 45, Watson 3-30) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson and Darren Sammy shake hands - but neither was satisfied by the result Associated Press Any lingering thoughts of a Caribbean holiday were swept decisively away from Australia by a thrilling and courageous West Indies chase to force a dramatic tie at a heaving Arnos Vale Ground. Tuesday had been declared a public holiday in St Vincent and a sold-out crowd was kept on its feet throughout as the two sides finished locked on 220 apiece on a pitch almost as lively for spin bowling as for dancing at the boundary's edge. The West Indies needed only one run from the final three deliveries to be bowled by Brett Lee, but a mix-up between the captain Darren Sammy and the last man Kemar Roach saw both stranded at the striker's end as Lee broke the stumps at his. However, the hosts' fight to level the scores having been mired as deeply as 78 for 5 will provide plenty of belief for Sammy's men, while also showing Australia's players that they cannot afford to misstep quite so badly as they have done at times in the three matches so far. This time the fault lay with the batsmen, who squandered the best of the conditions and failed completely to cope with the crafty spin of Sunil Narine."
"9.20am: The coin has been tossed - and Darren Sammy has won it (for the first time in 10 attempts, no less). He's decided West Indies will have a bowl, perhaps influenced by the conditions. I'm presuming he has not based his decision on the success of his team's chasing a Roach to Warner, OUT bowled him! The delivery was back of a length but shot through low, clipping Warner's pad as he tried to play back before rattling into the stumps halfway up. The batsman was done by the bounce (or lack thereof) - but he had already misjudged a c Roach to Forrest, OUT another one gone! Roach lures Forrest into a jab outside off, the bat well away from his body, and a thick edge is safely pouched by second slip Bravo to Hussey, 1 wide down the leg side, Bravo losing his radar Sammy to Watson, SIX runs shot! Sammy was a fraction short and Watson seized on it like a prizefighter spotting a gap in his opponent's guard, swinging an uppercut over the deep midwicket fence for a Dorothy Sammy to Watson, OUT Watson falls to the slower ball! Sammy rolled it out of the hand again - though it almost turned into a full toss - and Watson's clip flew off the toe of the bat to Devendra Bishoo, the substitute fielder, who took a low catch at midwicket Narine to Hussey, OUT he's been caught behind! Narine bowled it quicker and pitched it fuller, Hussey came forward to drive and edged it as the ball spun across him. Baugh took a sharp catch. He had little reaction time. Bravo to Bailey, OUT caught at point! Bailey's cut the slower ball straight to the fielder. Bravo pitched it short of a length outside off and got the ball to bounce a bit more - tennis-ball type bounce Narine to Hussey, 1 leg bye lots of turn into the right-hander but the ball ends up on the pads, allowing the batsman to work it behind square Narine to Wade, OUT Wade lunged on to the front foot and tried to slog sweep, top-edging the ball in the air to Roach at square leg Narine to Hussey, OUT bowled him! Two in the over. Hussey went back to cut and the ball spun back into him, inducing the bottom edge on to the stumps Narine to Lee, 1 bye Lee backs away outside leg and then tries to hit through midwicket. He misses and the ball goes between body and leg stump and beats the keeper Narine to McKay, OUT McKay's been stumped. He charged out of his crease and swung hard, the flat and quicker ball sped past the bat, and Baugh had an easy job to do Lee to Powell, OUT that's an abysmal leave! Lee's first ball is straight, on a good length and Powell shoulders arms! He's stuck in his crease, smack bang in front and that's the easiest decision Gregory Brathwaite has ever had to make, I imagine. What a start - West Watson to Samuels, OUT full ball ... yorked him! Looked like Watson might have rolled that out the back of the hand but Samuels played over the top of the ball and the bails pinged into the air as if popped from a toaster Watson to Bravo, 1 wide slanted down the leg side - another extra to the West Indies total Doherty to Bravo, OUT this was inevitable. Darren Bravo has been bowled off the inisde edge trying to drive the ball through cover. Doherty tossed the ball up outside off stump from round the wicket, drawing the batsmen into driving away from his body. Bravo reached Christian to Pollard, SIX runs after five dot balls, Christian drops one short and Pollard is quick to capitalise, staying back and heaving the ball over the midwicket boundary So, we now have a contest, with episode three scheduled for Tuesday; do join us again then. Bye! West Indies won by 5 wickets (with 10 balls remaining) (D/L method) Player of the match is Sunil Narine, WI","West Indies 163 for 5 in 38.2 overs (Pollard 47*) beat Australia 154 for 9 in 40 overs (David Hussey 37, Narine 4-27) by five wickets on D/L method Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Dwayne Bravo's 30 was an important contribution to West Indies' victory Associated Press Kieron Pollard blazed West Indies to a first ODI victory over Australia since 2006, his stand with Dwayne Bravo swallowing up the tourists' modest total in a rain-affected match at the Arnos Vale Ground. Set the Duckworth/Lewis-adjusted target of 158 from 40 overs after holding Australia to 154 for 9, the hosts made the worst possible start when Kieran Powell shouldered arms to Brett Lee's first ball of the innings and was palpably lbw. But from an uncertain 74 for 4, Pollard and Dwayne Bravo constructed the most assured stand of the match, and took West Indies to a deserved win with five wickets and 11 balls to spare. Pollard's innings was punctuated by three sixes in one critical four-over burst, and it was a spell of scoring that would prove decisive."
"Toss, 9.00 am Shane Watson has won the toss and Australia are going to bat. Bravo to Watson, 1 wide short ball and far down leg side, that's the first extra of the day Bravo to Watson, 1 wide that's another wide down leg side, two in as many overs for Bravo Bravo to Watson, OUT this time the umpire's given Watson lbw and Australia have asked for a review. It's quite similar to the appeal in Bravo's first over, which the umpire said was not out and West Indies reviewed unsuccessfully. Watson came half-forward to a delivery that nipped into him off the pitch. He was beaten on the front-foot defence and hit in front Russell to Warner, 1 wide a wide down leg side, the third of the innings Samuels to Forrest, OUT breakthrough for West Indies. Forrest's struggles are over. He came down the pitch and the ball beat the outside to provide Baugh the chance of a simple stumping. Samuels to Warner, OUT gone! Superb catch from Pollard and two in the over for Samuels. Warner punched it off the back foot and Pollard flung himself low to his left at cover to grab it inches from the turf. Anything in the air near Pollard is always dangerous, he's an incredible fielder. Roach to Hussey, 1 leg bye wow, where did that come from? An excellent bouncer from Roach which really climbed and took Hussey on the shoulder as he tried to sway out of the line. Baugh took the catch and West Indies were confident, but a good decision from umpire Dharmasena Roach to Hussey, OUT West Indies right on top now. In the channel outside off from Roach, Hussey pushed without much footwork and got a thin edge to the keeper Roach to Bailey, OUT Bailey's fallen two short of a half-century on debut. He backed away towards leg to create room and hit on the off side. He ended up scooping the ball high in the air and the fielder from the cover-point boundary came in to take a well-judged catch Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs that's been dropped beyond the long-off boundary! Samuels stepped out of his crease and blasted the ball flat and far, hitting it with a lot of power Doherty to Samuels, SIX runs that's the biggest of them all, Samuels has stepped out of his crease, got to the pitch of the ball, and lofted it straight over the bowler's head again, I don't think we'll be seeing Doherty during the Powerplay any more Christian to Bravo, OUT and there's his reward! A lovely delivery from Christian, another off-cutter which bites in the surface and zips between bat and pad to take off stump. Bit of a loose shot, but credit to the bowler for his consistency. Just what Australia needed as West Indies had settled nicely with this stand Lee to Roach, 1 wide pushed too far outside leg stump and an easy call for a wide McKay to Sammy, 1 wide starts with a slower-ball gone wrong that loops out well wide of off stump Australia, though, will be delighted with the winning start on a tricky surface. The batting wasn't and its best but they mustered a decent total. Early wickets then gave them a lift then Doherty responded superbly from a tough first over that cost 18. Player of the match is George Bailey, AUS","Australia 204 for 8 (Bailey 48, Bravo 3-58) beat West Indies 140 (Sammy 35, Samuels 35, Doherty 4-49) by 64 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details George Bailey's 48 on debut proved very important for Australia AFP Xavier Doherty enjoyed his first taste of cricket in the West Indies, playing a key role in Australia's 64-run victory in the first ODI in St Vincent. After the debutant George Bailey top scored in Australia's 204 for 8, a total that was difficult to assess at the halfway point on a sluggish pitch, West Indies capitulated to be all out for 140, and their failure was all the more disappointing for the self-inflicted nature of several of the dismissals. Batting was clearly not easy on a surface with such little pace, but too few of the West Indian batsmen showed the discipline required to stick around and chip away at the target. Darren Sammy displayed some late fight and compiled a 36-run partnership for the last wicket with Kemar Roach, but until that point they had lost their previous six wickets for seven runs. Prior to that collapse, the chase appeared to be going well as Dwayne Bravo and Marlon Samuels built a confident 64-run stand and went after the spin of Doherty and David Hussey."
"Toss: Sri Lanka have won the toss and they have opted to bowl first. They are not playing a second spinner, so Dilshan should bowl his quota. Watson says he would have batted anyway. He will continue to bat at No.3. Forrest returns. Kulasekara to Wade, 1 wide Sanga has done well to stop four certain wides there, too wide down the leg side Maharoof to Warner, OUT Sri Lanka will be mighty relieved at that because it's Warner! Things get a little tasty as Maharoof walks past the batsman, Maharoof angles it across the left-hander, the batsman gets a thick outside edge and it's well taken by Sanga falling to his left, Maharoof says something to Warner who Dilshan to Watson, 1 wide that was too wide down the leg side, poor ball Kulasekara to Wade, OUT direct hit and he's gone! Excellent work by Dilshan there, Wade sliced it down towards short point and wasn't sure about the single, Hussey was off the blocks but Dilshan was too quick for him, picks up and throws flat at the stumps in one motion, just short of his ground and the third umpire Kulasekara to Hussey, 1 leg bye drifts on the pads and he tucks it towards square leg Herath to Wade, OUT can't keep Herath out for too long! Strikes with ball No.1, comes round the wicket, Wade makes room to cut but he ends up getting a thick outside edge, good reflexes nevertheless as he takes it in the second attempt. Good knock by Wade Herath to Forrest, OUT Forrest looked quite flummoxed there! Herath got it to grip and Forrest was looking to drive towards mid-off but the ball spun just a bit and hit the off stump, Forrest playing down the wrong line Maharoof to Hussey, OUT hits him a touch high but Asad Rauf's convinced! Maharoof gets it to nip back in off the pitch, the ball skids through and hits his thigh but Rauf was convinced with the height, took a few seconds before raising the finger Malinga to Lee, 1 wide loses control of that slower delivery and sprays it wide of the off stump Maharoof to Christian, OUT Maharoof strikes again! He continues bowling the slower ball, Christian chips down the track and has to check his shot, ends up spooning it straight to mid-off, Jayawardene takes it Herath to McKay, OUT McKay perishes trying to go over the top on the on side, he gets on his knee for the slog and he ends up hitting it flat to Maharoof at deep midwicket, he falls forward and takes it Kulasekara to Lee, OUT knocks off the leg bail! Kula bowls another yorker on the leg stump, Lee makes room to flay that anywhere but the ball hits his boot and shaves the leg stump Kulasekara to Lyon, OUT not the best start to Lyon's ODI career with the bat! Kulasekara bowls it full on the pads and Lyon makes room and chips it high over midwicket and Senanayake the substitute times the dive well and takes the catch Still, such is the nature of these teams that even 231 might turn out to be competitive. Don't count Australia out yet. They will come out charging. Whatever it is, we should expect another absorbing chase. Join us in 30 minutes. There was some debate whether SL gambled by not taking the extra spinner, but Maharoof responded well and justified his inclusion. It could have been a lot worse for Australia, if not for their lower order. McKay to Chandimal, OUT and there is no escaping the dreaded finger this time around! Fuller ball on the off and middle line. Chandimal leans across and looks to flick it. He misjudges the length and is struck on the pads.The umpire doesn't waste a second in raising the index finger. Sri Lanka does need the batting de Christian to Upul Tharanga, 1 leg bye drifts on the pads and he clips it off his legs to the on side Lee to Upul Tharanga, 1 wide he ducks under that quick bouncer and the umpire penalises him Doherty to Upul Tharanga, 4 wide slides it down the leg side and it beats the keeper Watson to Upul Tharanga, 1 leg bye full on the pads and he clips it with his legs to deep square leg Lee to Kulasekara, 5 wide big lapse from Lee as he sprays this one wide down the leg side and beats the diving Wade, can't blame the keeper at all Presentation time: Player of the match is Clint McKay, AUS","Australia 231 (Wade 49, Warner 48, Herath 3-36, Maharoof 3-40) beat Sri Lanka 215 (Tharanga 71, McKay 5-28) by 16 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Clint McKay's career-best effort wrecked Sri Lanka's chase AFP Smart stats Australia won the tri-series for the first time since their triumph in 2005-06.

"Dilshan to Wade, OUT bowled him! Dilshan's been skidding his balls through to the batsman, and Wade tried to pull this one when it wasn't that short, he missed and Dilshan hit off stump Maharoof to Warner, SIX runs Warner's smashed it! He wound up and swung hard at a length ball on the front foot, clearing the wide long-on boundary comfortably. That's a long boundary at Adelaide Oval and Warner hit the ball into the stands. That was measured at 99 metres. A monster of a hit. Herath to Clarke, 1 wide that's down leg side and a wide Malinga to Hussey, OUT bowled him! Hussey comes out of his crease and towards the leg side, trying to drive through the off. Malinga beats him with a full and fast ball and hits the stumps Malinga to Hussey, OUT bowled him, Malinga lands another perfect yorker and beats Hussey's slog with the swing into the right-hander, the ball clips leg stump 5.20 pm Australia have finished with a strong total on a slowish pitch, with Clarke and Warner scoring contrasting centuries. Warner was the slower one, Clarke was quick and quite terrific. Sri Lanka were poor in the field, several fumbles, some overthrows and five dropped catches. They aren't out of this yet though, because Australia could have easily Brett Lee will opening the bowling for Australia, from over the wicket. Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 leg bye length ball on the pads, Mahela plays the glance from his crease towards fine leg McKay to Mahela Jayawardene, (no ball) caught behind! But the umpire is checking to see if it's a front-foot no-ball. It is, McKay had overstepped. It was a wide ball outside off and Mahela slashed at it, reaching far away from his body. He got a thick edge through to the keeper. The Australians began to celebrate but the umpire Bruce Oxenford Pattinson to Dilshan, 3 wide whoa, that's sprayed far down leg side, massive swing past the right-hander and Wade does superbly to dive to his left and get some glove on it McKay to Dilshan, 1 leg bye another slower ball, Dilshan tries to turn the ball towards the leg side but gets hit on the thigh for a leg bye on the off side Pattinson to Dilshan, 1 wide a full ball on the pads, Wade dives to his left to collect 9.30 pm As far as chases of substantial totals go, this is as strong as they come. Sri Lanka, through a poor performance in the field, were faced with a target of 272 and they've gunned it down with eight wickets in hand and 34 balls to spare.

Chasing 272, the visitors galloped to the target with 5.4 overs to spare, benefiting greatly from a rollicking start when the first three overs reaped 30 runs. Dilshan alternated between the brazen and the cheeky, crashing 10 fours and also being struck on the helmet when he attempted his patented Dil-scoop. The captain Jayawardene was more cultured, but outpaced his partner in a princely innings that would have ended in the second over if not for a Clint McKay no-ball."
"Kulasekara to Wade, OUT An outstanding catch by Herath, for a moment it seemed Wade had struck it cleanly to send it over the ropes but it wasn't timed as well as initially thought, Herath was at long-on and Wade had enough on it to get it past him as he was standing a few yards inside the ropes, Herath thou Malinga to Warner, SIX runs Six, Malinga bowls it short on middle with a fine leg up, Warner stays his ground and pulls it well behind square and it has enough on it to clear the ropes, just about Maharoof to Watson, OUT Watson goes, it's been a quiet Powerplay so far, that landed on leg stump, was a slower ball, tried to flick it square but ended up playing uppishly and it appeared to come off the top edge as well, Thirimanne ran in from deep square leg and took a safe catch Prasad to Christian, OUT Christian goes!

Short of a length delivery that hurried Sangakkara who began to swivel pull but then checked his shot, the ball went off the top edge high in the air and straight to Peter Forrest. The partnership ends on 123, it's been a splendid one. Pattinson to Chandimal, OUT caught at mid-off! Chandimal's gone this time. He was on the front foot and he tried to hit down the ground, the length wasn't short enough for that shot and he holed out to McKay at mid-off. He's made 75, an excellent innings. Pattinson's taken his third wicket. Christian to Angelo Mathews, OUT caught, splendidly caught! The ball was a slightly slower one outside off stump and Mathews was on the front foot and into his shot too early. He tried to check it but ended up spooning the ball in the air down the ground. Doherty ran quickly from mid-on towards the boundary, covered a lot of ground, and took the catch as the ball dropped over his head McKay to Thirimanne, 1 leg bye nudged off the pads behind square for a single Christian to Perera, OUT caught on the deep midwicket boundary! Michael Hussey takes a special kind of catch, one that is becoming less rare these days. Perera swung hard and hit the ball high towards deep midwicket, Hussey ran back and settled under the ball and took the catch inside play. He realised he was going to go over the boundary so he threw the ball up, stepped over the rope, stepped back in, and caught the ball again. Christian to Senanayake, OUT lbw! The ball is full and straight, Senanayake moves across his crease and tries to play on the leg side by closing the face of his bat, he misses and is hit in front, that would have clipped leg stump Christian to Kulasekara, OUT a hat-trick for Christian! He bowled a full ball that swung into the right-hander, Kulasekara did what Senanayake did, moved across and tried to flick. He missed and got hit on the pad, this looked like it was missing leg but the umpire didn't think so. Christian is mobbed by his team-mates. Pattinson to Herath, SIX runs Herath swings hard at a length ball outside off and gets a top edge that flies down to third man and clears the boundary. Doesn't matter how they come, eh? That ball landed on the rope Pattinson to Thirimanne, OUT he's been bowled off the middle of the bat! Thirimanne moved across his stumps to try and scoop the ball over fine leg, he made decent contact, but deflected the ball on to his stumps Christian to Herath, 1 bye Herath swings and misses, Wade collects and throws at the bowler's end and misses, he concedes an overthrow towards long-off Christian to Malinga, OUT bowled him! Christian finishes with five wickets. Malinga moved way across his stumps to glance towards fine leg and he missed. The ball was straight and hit middle stump. 6.10 pm Sri Lanka have finished with 238, a score that is less than par on this pitch. They were set for at least 40 more when Sangakkara and Chandimal were steering the innings. But they fell away after that partnership. Christian wrecked the innings with a hat-trick and finished with 5 for 31. Pattinson was making a comeback from injury and he took four wickets as well. Malinga to Wade, 1 wide that is a harsh call for wide outside off stump, it wasn't outside those guiding tram lines Kulasekara to Wade, OUT lbw! Kulasekara pitched the ball in line with the stumps from over the wicket and angled it across the left-hander, Wade moved across his crease to play on the leg side and was hit on the back pad. Height might have been the only issue but that looked pretty good. The umpire thought so too. The MCG comes to life, there are so many Sri Lankan fans today and they are cheering themselves hoarse. Replays indicate that height was no p Kulasekara to Forrest, 1 wide that's down leg side and Sangakkara leaps to his left to collect Malinga to Hussey, 5 wide Malinga loses his line, firing it down leg side, Sangakkara should have stopped that though, but it's cost Sri Lanka five extras Herath to Watson, 1 wide bowled flat and down leg side, that's a wide Dilshan to Hussey, 2 wide his first ball is short and extremely far down leg side Senanayake to Pattinson, 1 wide that's down leg side and a wide Kulasekara to Hussey, OUT Sri Lanka have won! Hussey has been caught at long off, and listen to the MCG erupt! Mahela Jayawardene is ecstatic. Hussey decided to attack Kulasekara and lofted him down the ground, he hit the full ball flat but not far enough, Dilshan was the man at long-off and he held the catch to send the fans at the MCG into wild celebrations. Sri Lanka have played a tremendous game and are in the finals Dinesh Chandimal is the Man of the Match for his half-century. He's the top scorer of the series, and batted with admirable temperament today after Sri Lanka had lost two early wickets. He scored briskly, taking pressure of Sangakkara, and kept Sri Lanka going. 10.25 pm Sri Lanka needed to prevent Australia from winning to make the finals of the triangular series. They were on course for a huge total before the middle and lower order failed and they finished on 238. Mahela Jayawardene then lost two bowlers, Perera to a side strain and Mathews to a calf injury. He kept his nerve and maintained attacking fields throughout to lead his team to a superb victory. They have qualified for the final on top of the league. A f Player of the match is Dinesh Chandimal, SL","Sri Lanka 238 (Chandimal 75, Sangakkara 64, Thirimanne 51, Christian 5-31, Pattinson 4-51) beat Australia 229 (D Hussey 74, Watson 65, Malinga 4-49) by nine runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Daniel Christian picked up a hat-trick, but it was Sri Lanka who finished on top Getty Images Sri Lanka entered this match with their fate in their own hands. It turns out those are pretty safe hands. Not even a hat-trick from Daniel Christian, a four-wicket comeback from James Pattinson, a captain's half-century from Shane Watson or a remarkable, late, fighting fifty from David Hussey could prevent Sri Lanka from winning the last qualifying match at the MCG. Lasith Malinga led a strong bowling performance to complete Sri Lanka's nine-run victory, which propelled them into the tri-series finals. No doubt Australia were disappointed, for they must now enter the best-of-three deciders knowing they have lost their previous three games to their Sri Lankan opponents."

And it's a five-for for Shillingford as well, Wade goes another of his slogs but doesn't get the distance, went flatter to deep midwicket and Bravo caught it, threw Shilling to Hilfenhaus, OUT well make that six for Shillingford! Tossed up generously and Hilfenhaus tries to hoick him away over the on side, misses it and the ball hits the middle stump Paul pointed out that England's Phil DeFreitas was also born in Dominica. Lunch: So West Indies just about sneak in the last two wickets before lunch. They really should have done a lot better and the inability to finish things off will be addressed before they leave for England. Warner to Bravo, OUT and he goes to a part-timer! Simplest of catches, Bravo is forward to defend but he doesn't cover the line properly, big inside edge onto the pads, lobs up and Cowan had all the time in the world to catch it Lyon to Powell, OUT short but dragged it on a real bonus wicket for Australia. Maybe it kept a touch low but the cut stroke has dragged a back of a length ball onto the base of off stump and that is a poor dismissal and a major blow for the West Indies Harris to Deonarine, 1 bye bouncer, ducked and fumbled by the keeper Lyon to Baugh, OUT bat, pad and taken at short leg and heavens are the Aussie's on top now!

Yes, great work in the covers, Sammy's full length dive is not enough and West Indies slump again and what a silly way to give away another wicket Starc to Shilling, OUT bowled first ball! A fabulous full, inswinging delivery that is far too good for Shillingford, he's so late on it and didn't move his feet, getting a little inside edge onto the off stump Hilfenhaus to Rampaul, 1 leg bye ducks a bumper and off the helmet, flush blow on the lid Lyon to Rampaul, OUT Lyon has his fourth, and Rampaul has gotten himself out needlessly, came down the track to try and hit Lyon over midwicket, against the spin, and with so much turn around for the offspinner, Rampaul manages a thick edge off a heave, wh Starc to Chanderpaul, OUT that looks gone, that was shaping up to be an outswinger to the left-hander, it straightened in the air too from over the stumps after being angled in, Chanders cannot be blamed for pushing at the original line, but it then moves Innings Start Nathan Lyon, whom the left handers played far easier, also opening up...","Australia 328 and 259 beat West Indies 218 and 294 (Chanderpaul 69, Sammy 61, Clarke 5-86, Lyon 3-87) by 75 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Darren Sammy fought hard but couldn't prevent Australia from wrapping up a 2-0 series victory AFP In the end, the final day of the tour followed the same script as the rest of the series: West Indies fought hard and provided Australia with a few headaches, but their efforts came to nought. Instead, Michael Clarke's second five-wicket haul in Tests helped the Australians wrap up a 75-run victory and they took the series 2-0, despite some powerful striking from the West Indies captain Darren Sammy. It took Australia two hours on the fifth morning to take the five wickets that remained after the critical breakthrough in the last over of the fourth day, when Shivnarine Chanderpaul was lbw. With each four and six that Sammy produced the West Indian fans dreamed of a famous win, but too much had been left to the lower order and a steady stream of wickets meant Sammy and the No.11 Shane Shillingford came together with 125 runs still needed."
"Shilling to Pattinson, OUT after one time, it is two time. They have waited hours for one edge, but like buses two have followed each other. Both set batsmen gone. Shilly bowls a slow offbreak on middle and leg, Patto's bat turns early, and it lobs off the leading edge. They nearly make a meal of it as nobody calls for it. Barath has takes a few steps back from silly point to catch, but hang on. Bravo moves in late from cover, and takes the catch. Barath is wondering where the ball is.

Hits the thigh pad outside the line of leg, but the ricochet hits the stumps Roach to Beer, OUT Beer reviews now. He has been given out lbw as he has shuffled too far across. This is short of a length, nips in from outside off, Beer is across, his inside edge is beaten, and he is hit high on the pad, in front of middle and leg. Erasmus gives him out immediately, Beer reviews immediately. The replays show it to be hitting the top of leg, which means he is gone, and Roach gets five 9.35am A good start for Australia. They have answered the first call of duty, which was to take this last wicket. They now have a lead of 54 on a breaking pitch, but do they have enough time to force a result?

Set 192 to win in two sessions, the Australians started their chase slowly and were almost derailed by middle-order wickets, but Michael Hussey's calm and rational approach ensured they narrowly outpaced the setting sun to win by three wickets. In a tense conclusion, Hussey was bowled by Kemar Roach for 32 from 26 balls with three runs still required, but Ryan Harris and Ben Hilfenhaus saw the Australians home and denied West Indies a satisfactory outcome despite them dominating the first three days. Hilfenhaus struck the winning run with a single scrambled to the off side and a direct-hit at the bowler's end was sent to the third umpire, who found Hilfenhaus in his ground by a few inches. All the while, the players were keeping an eye on the umpires, who were keeping an eye on the light and under the new ICC rules have complete authority to determine whether play continues or ceases."
"Wood to Stoinis, OUT edged and taken! Bowls full, tempting Stoinis to drive, but the ball takes the outside edge and Buttler needs to dive to his right to take the catch. That was quick! A good innings from Stoinis in a position he usually doesn't bat in, but with the start he got, he will feel disappointed not capitalizing Rashid to Labuschagne, OUT full just outside off and the googly comes into him. Big stride forward to defend, but hits his front leg, and the lbw appeal is given out! Marnus reviews right away No bat involved, and that's pitched just outside off, and hit off stump. Labuschagne needs to go. Rashid gets the wicket via the googly. Australia in all sorts of trouble Ali to Marsh, no run fullish, on off, and fended off the back foot. Moeen's economy under six for the first time Archer to Maxwell, SIX runs in the slot on the stumps, Maxwell frees his arms looking to go leg side and sends it sailing high and mighty over the rope! Lots of elevation, but enough distance on it to fly over the midwicket boundary Archer to Maxwell, OUT chopped on! Slower ball, slightly short outside off, Maxwell looked to heave over the leg side but only managed to drag it onto his stumps via the toe of the bat. Big moment in this match Archer to Cummins, OUT length outside off, slashed miles up into the air, and the man at cover in the ring holds on! Archer is laughing - did Morgan nearly drop this?! Ooft, yeah, almost slipped out as he went Australian-style with the hands up. This looked like a knuckleball - plenty of room for Cummins to free his arms, but he was through the shot far too early Wood to Marsh, OUT struck on the pad, and the finger goes up! Marsh reviews immediately. Looked pretty good to the naked eye, and Ultra-Edge says there's no bat involved. Hit in-line, and hitting middle-and-leg three-quarters of the way up! Marsh has to depart after a gritty 73. He was looking to get off strike with a push into the leg side towards midwicket, but Wood did him for pace. Wood to Zampa, 1 leg bye length ball, nudged towards the covers as Zampa backs away. They take on a sharp single, Wood kicks towards the stumps at the keeper's end but Starc is comfortably in even as the ball hits the stumps Woakes to Zampa, OUT short ball, back of a length, and Zampa top-edges the pull straight up into the air... Woakes pouches it! Australia lose their ninth, and Woakes has a wicket to show for his efforts 5.12pm Hello and welcome back to the chase. If this was any other side, on a tired batting track, we'd say the chasing team's backs are against the wall, but not when England are the team trying to raze this total down. But the way Mitch Starc ended the Australia innings, if he could bring that momentum into his opening spell and take a wicket or two... then it's game on.Bairstow's doing his final str Starc to Roy, 1 wide back of a length, on leg stump, and shaping further down. Roy considered flicking it fine... Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 wide good length, outside off, and angling further away. Wide given Hazlewood to Roy, OUT what a stunner! A one-handed grab... on his followthrough, that's epic from Hazlewood! Not full enough for the drive, yet he drives, but the ball comes off the actual middle of the bat - which isn't really the sweet spot - and Hazlewood maintains his balance to stick his right hand out and the ball stays in his palm. Big wicket t Hazlewood to Morgan, SIX runs here we go! Full, outside off and he runs down the ground to smash a six over wide long off! He Zampa to Morgan, 1 wide good length, on leg stump. Sharp turn down the leg side though Zampa to Morgan, 1 leg bye good length on leg, and Morgan comes down the wicket. It hits his pads and rolls away to the leg side Marsh to Billings, 1 leg bye length ball on the pads, clipped to square leg for a leg-bye Marsh to Billings, SIX runs aggressive!

They'll need to check up on Billings for a prospective concussion as per new rules. Short ball, angling into leg. Plenty of you rightly pointed out how valuable Starc's cameo - 19 off 12 balls - ended up being for Australia. If Woakes, Rashid or Archer had managed that, it could have been very different.

A century stand between Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh helped salvage a stuttering effort with the bat, and the bowlers then closed the door on England despite a characterful maiden international hundred from Sam Billings. Australia's efforts with the ball were exemplified by Josh Hazlewood, whose spotless 3 for 26 helped keep England just beyond social distance. Hazlewood's first wicket came via an instinctive one-handed catch in his follow through, and he later contributed to the removal of Jonny Bairstow, for 84, with a diving take at long-on. Such excellence in the field, maintained until the final ball when Billings was held by David Warner running in from long-on, only served to steepen England's climb."
"Lee to Bell, OUT oh no, Bell MK II suffers a familiar glitch, hit in front of off and he has to go, no matter how attractive his 41 was! It was another testing ball from Lee, nipping back just a shade and Bell tried to drive back down the pitch, looked like a good call from Cummins to Cook, OUT Lord's falls quiet as Cook chases one outside off and nicks off. Cummins has his first international wicket against England (the first of many?) and Australia's bowlers are finally getting the rewards for their disciplined approach Cummins to Trott, 1 wide loses his line this time, attempted slower ball which doesn't come out right and is dragged very wide McKay to Bopara, OUT gone! Strikes first ball with a lovely delivery. Squared up Bopara on off stump and the edge flies comfortably to Michael Clarke at slip who is rewarded for still attacking Cummins to Morgan, SIX runs big blow! Morgan breaks free by launching a full delivery high straight down the ground and it comfortably clears the boundary Doherty to Trott, OUT tossed up on leg stump and bowled him!

Strange dismissal, that, Hussey mistimed his pull completely, was hit on the shoudler, then the helmet, the ball finally plopping on to the wicket Bresnan to Smith, OUT length ball, in the corridor and Smith fences weakly at it, nicking through to the keeper! That won't convince the doubters, pushing away from his body, perhaps trying to guide the ball to third man ... but failing Swann to Clarke, SIX runs shot! Massive strike into the Tavern stand, picked up from outside off and timed superbly into the crowd Bresnan to Clarke, 1 wide slower ball and a leg side wide Bresnan to Clarke, OUT got him this time!

Bresnan to Lee, 1 wide and now a slower ball wide Broad to McKay, OUT down the pitch, straight up and caught by Kieswetter.

First blood in the NatWest series went to England, but the match felt closer than the final 15-run margin would indicate. Australia's chances departed with their captain, Michael Clarke, who had made 61 from 67 balls when he walked across his stumps, not for the first time, and was aghast to fall plumb lbw to a swinging, low full toss from Tim Bresnan. It aggravated the hurt of the previous over when Australia lost Matthew Wade to a run out. Wade had just lifted James Anderson into the Mound Stand, Clarke had deposited Graeme Swann's offspin into the Tavern and another 69 from 49 balls felt just about gettable."

So dominant with the bat in his recent appearances as ODI captain of England, not to mention a 766-run Ashes jaunt down under in the last Ashes series, Cook lasted only 15 balls for 5 as the tourists routed Essex at Chelmsford in their final warm-up for the looming NatWest Series which begins at Lord's on Friday. Cook's conqueror here was the Victorian seamer Clint McKay. Cracked to the backward point boundary early on, he persisted with a back-of-a-length line outside off stump and was rewarded when Cook edged an attempted forcing stroke to Michael Clarke at slip. By that point Mark Pettini had already departed, slicing Brett Lee to third man, and the Australians' towering 313 for 9 was never to be threatened."
"5.15pm England win the toss and bowl, no real surprise there. Tim Bresnan has a sore elbow so misses out and England play both James Tredwell and Samit Patel. No rest for either Stuart Broad or James Anderson. Still no game for Woakes, either. Finn to Warner, 1 wide extravagant seam movement and bounce as Warner is beaten playing another cut...but it's a fraction too wide Broad to Wade, 1 wide loses his fine down the leg side so that's an extra ball Tredwell to Warner, OUT tossed up, misses with the sweep and gone! Warner often looks a little uncertain trying to work slower bowlers around and he falls to a plumb lbw decision, the ball was full and straightening on middle and he didn't get anything on it. Hawk Eye showing pretty big turn Tredwell to Wade, OUT flighted, spinning past the bat as Wade advances and stumped! Lovely dismissal for Tredwell, who lured the struggling Wade out of his crease, beat him with the turn - in fact almost bowled him - and Kieswetter was alert to whip off the bails Bopara to Smith, OUT loosener, down the leg side - and Smith gets a tickle through to Kieswetter! Australia hit another bump in the road and that's a gimme for Bopara, whose gentle medium pace somehow foxed Smith Bopara to Hussey, OUT Bopara strikes again as Hussey feathers through to the keeper! It was another innocuous delivery, slightly short and wide, Hussey tried to dab it through the off side and nicked off. Bopara's golden arm could probably refloat the European economy right now Finn to Pattinson, OUT big appeal and not out...England are convinced Pattinson edged the slower ball as he heaved to leg. No reviews left for England. There was certainly a noise. Oh, hang on, the umpires are conferring about whether this has carried. So it could be out after all. This isn't Anderson to Bailey, SIX runs that's a clean strike! Picked it up beautifully and launched it over long-on...been a very good innings from Bailey. Anderson just missed his length McKay to Bell, OUT full and straight, Bell advances, clips off the pads straight to midwicket! Bailey takes it comfortably and that's a first failure for Bell in his latest incarnation as an opener. Slightly soft dismissal but an early wicket is just what Australia needed Hilfenhaus to Cook, 1 wide pushed through outside off, no swing and that's a wide Clarke to Trott, OUT this one spins, beats Trott's sweep and bowls him! Clarke held it up a bit this time, Trott was through the shot and the ball gripped, straightened and rattled into the top of off. Nice bowling from the captain - if only he could trust the frontline left-arm spinner in his Pattinson to Bopara, 1 wide a bouncer that's too short for Dar's liking and it's called wide...way over Bopara's head Right, this one has dragged on long enough.

Australia remain top of the ICC one-day rankings solely because of the abandoned match at Edgbaston, spared by Pommie rain. England were set 146 for victory in 32 overs, a target reduced to 138 in 29 as rain tumbled for the last time from churlish Lancashire skies. There was potential for it to be awkward as Australia took two quick wickets, but Alastair Cook, looking more and more like a one-day captain of status, and Ravi Bopara, in one of his most bullish innings in an England shirt, timed England's seven-wicket victory with 11 balls to spare with aplomb. Cook fell with 12 runs needed, caught at slip off Ben Hilfenhaus for 58, but Bopara, his Essex colleague, saw things though."

He was cramped for room and ended up bottom edging on to middle stump Bopara to Bailey, OUT that is a terrific ball and it's bowled Bailey! Bopara pitched the ball on a good length around middle stump and got it to straighten and leave the right-hander just enough to beat the outside edge of Bailey's forward push and clip the top of off stump. McGrath Finn to Clarke, OUT cleaned him up now though and this is a cracker, a length ball seams back and takes the off and middle stumps.

It was mistimed and Broad came in to take a comfortable catch. Having just taken a six was another big heave required? Five singles, 11 off the over would do. After a lovely little innings Bresnan to Hussey, OUT caught on the boundary and Hussey falls trying to find the rope again, slugging a length ball towards long off, Anderson comes round and claims the comfortable chance Brett Lee has the first new ball, and will sprint in from over the wicket. Alastair Cook and Ian Bell are opening for England. McKay to Bell, OUT chopped it on. Bell, rather like Wason earlier today, drags a ball onto the stumps as he looked to guide it to third man, maybe just drifted in but it was too close for the stroke probably, Bell didn't go back to make room for the shot and ended up awkwardly crampe Hussey to Trott, 1 wide down the leg side, Wade whips off the bails and they'll go upstairs to look for the stumping but Trott lifted his foot a few hours after Wade had removed the bails, not out A comfortable chase and England win by eight wickets and absolutely hammer Australia, It was a super performance with the ball and a chase that was never in doubt... Today the toss was crucial but England were so good with the ball, once again they ripped out the Australian top order and it was left to Michael Clarke to try and create something which he did. At least today, David Hussey stepped up in the middle order to put some sort of score on the boa England have the series then, can they make it 4-0? Find out on Tuesday for the final match of this series from Old Trafford, 2pm start so join us then.

Their last series win against Australia came in 2010 at home when they won 3-2. Since the beginning of 2010, England have played seven home ODI series and have won all of them. In three of the seven series, they won by a margin of 3-2. This is only the fourth occasion that England have managed a win by a margin of eight or more wickets in an ODI against Australia."
"10.15am Australia won the toss and will bat Peter Forrest replaces Steve Smith and Johnson confirmed as Cummins' replacement. For England, Jade Dernbach on his home ground comes in for James Anderson. ""I'm very sorry to hear that Pat Cummins is out of the tour, injured yet again. The prospect of having discovered a new Dennis Lillee was thrilling, but unfortunately it seems Australia might have discovered a new Ryan Harris."" Indeed disappointing John, hopefully he's a young man who will get stronger an Finn to Warner, 1 leg bye too straight now and off the pad wide of Kieswetter for a single Finn to Warner, OUT and there is the wicket! Pulled straight up and into the hands of square leg. It was short and slightly wide, Warner tried to fetch it to leg and was late on the stroke, getting a top edge that looped up to square leg. Big wicket for England and the extra pace of Finn tells again Broad to Forrest, OUT great catch! And Broad strikes, it was dug in and Forrest looked to pull, it came off the face of the bat and a diving Kieswetter snaffled it with one hand, superb take. Seemed to be beaten for pace there Forrest, he looked to help it on its way but ended up brushing it behind Bopara to Clarke, OUT but this is edged behind! Goodness me I did not expect that, a little cutter outside off and Clarke feathers it low to Kieswetter. It was a good length and Clarke pushed at it and got a thing edge through to the keeper, good area from Bopara and a mistake from Clarke Swann to Watson, OUT lofted, high towards deep midwicket and Finn takes the catch low the ground ... Watson goes! Swann tempted Watson out of his crease, maybe dragged the length down a smidge, the batsman heaved high but it's a long boundary and Finn plunged forward to claim it Dernbach to Bailey, 1 wide slides down the leg side - that's a wide Dernbach to Bailey, 1 leg bye good slower ball from Dernbach, hits Hussey on the pads as he tried to work through midwicket, would have missed leg but chalk that up as a victory to the bowler Bresnan to Bailey, OUT another full bunger and bowled 'im! Excellent death delivery from Bresnan, pitched up and asking the batsman to take a chance - Bailey did but his heave-ho was unsuccessful, the timbers sounding a death rattle Bresnan to Wade, OUT another one down, caught a short fine leg trying to ramp the ball over the infield! Bresnan's length has been hard to hit, Wade tried to improvise but couldn't clear the man. Bresnan looks like a man who's found a twinkie down the back of the sofa Bresnan to Lee, SIX runs low full toss and this time Lee middles it, fetching the ball a long way over the rope at long-on. BOOM! Dernbach to Johnson, 1 leg bye length delivery, Johnson has a golf swing at it, hit on the pad and it slides away towards the slip - Dernbach appeals but it probably pitched outside the line Finally out come the umpires for the second half this afternoon...Brett Lee to open the bowling and Alastair Cook on strike... McKay to Cook, OUT and there is a wicket with Cook caught on the crease and plumb lbw. Boy did Australia need that. Excellent delivery, good length around off stump, it shaped back to beat the forward push of Cook and caught him around the knee roll bang in front of middle Watson to Trott, OUT Trott advances on Watson, gets a faint inside edge, and the ball rattles the stumps! The ball was pretty similar to the one Bell hit out of the park but Trott played with an angled bat - where Bell's was straight - and Watson skidded it through the gap to disturb wicket. Trott' Johnson to Bell, 1 wide wide of off stump this time England won by 6 wickets (with 26 balls remaining) Player of the match is Ravi Bopara, ENG","England 252 for 4 (Bopara 82, Bell 75) beat Australia 251 for 7 (Watson 66, Hussey 65, Bresnan 2-50) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ian Bell made passed 50 for the third time in his last four ODI innings Getty Images It is one of the ironies of England's recent resurgence in all formats of the game that, for all their meticulous planning, two of the crucial ingredients of their success have come through luck. Just as it was only the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores as captain that brought Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss together as captain and coach, so it has only been the ""retirement"" of Pietersen from limited-overs international cricket that presented another chance to Ian Bell as an ODI batsman. It is not just luck, of course. It is how England have adjusted to circumstance and overcome the obstacles that have arisen. But it remains true that, had Pietersen not departed the England limited-overs set-up recently, it is most unlikely that Bell would have returned to the top of the England order."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. Australia are unchanged. Abdur Rehman replaces the injured Afridi and Junaid Khan replaces Aizaz Cheema. Junaid to Wade, OUT well Umar Akmal needn't beat himself up for that drop! Soon after being let off, Wade chases a full and wide delivery outside off and drags it to his stumps, not exactly a wicket-taking delivery though, the shot didn't come off r Junaid to Clarke, 1 wide drifts down the leg side and wide called Tanvir to Warner, 1 leg bye tucks it away off his thighs to the leg side Tanvir to Clarke, 1 wide struggling with the extras here, this was outside the off stump and he safely left it alone, too wide Ajmal to Warner, OUT and the long, long vigil comes to an end! Pitching on the leg and middle, hitting on the pad and struck low on the pads. Ticks all the boxes required to dole out an LBW decision. Ajmal is ecstatic. Warner is asked,by his captai Ajmal to Hussey, SIX runs Ajmal decides it's time to generous and bowls him a friendly full toss, Hussey moved across and clubbed it across the line and sent the ball sailing over deep midwicket Ajmal to Hussey, OUT Pakistan have struck with two lbws in quick succession! Hussey looked a bit surprised, he was a long way across his stumps and hence exposed the leg stump and a part of middle, the ball spun back in and hit him low on the pads, Abdur to Bailey, OUT soft dismissal! Rehman tossed it up on middle and off and Bailey was looking to chip it to the on side but ended up spooning it back to the bowler Tanvir to Johnson, 1 leg bye full on the pads and squirted away down to midwicket Hafeez to Hussey, 1 leg bye floated on the pads and it skids through, hits the pads and rolls to the off side, there was an appeal but that was missing leg Junaid to Christian, OUT that was a sharp catch by Jamshed! Christian fetched that from outside off and pulled it flat and fast towards deep midwicket, Jamshed ran across to his right and plucked the ball on the dive Junaid to Johnson, OUT ends his spell with two wickets in as many balls! Junaid bowled that full and straight on the stumps, Johnson had a wild swing and missed it completely, crashed onto off and middle Pattinson to Hafeez, 1 wide starts off with a wide and he slides it down the leg side Pattinson to Jamshed, 1 wide another wide down the leg side, Jamshed tried to flick it away Starc to Hafeez, 1 wide pitches it up but down the leg side and wide called Maxwell to Jamshed, 3 wide once again he errs by sliding it down the leg side, tries to sweep, the ball deflects off Wade Christian to Hafeez, OUT Hafeez has fallen for the trap! There was a fielder at deep square leg and he hit it straight to him, it was short outside off and Hafeez chose to club it across the line, ended up pulling it flat and Mike Hussey did well t Christian to Azhar Ali, 1 wide Azhar decides to chip down the track before delivery and a distracted Christian bowled it too wide of the off stump Johnson to Jamshed, 1 wide terrible delivery down the leg side, Jamshed swung his bat at it but it was too wide Christian to Azhar Ali, 1 leg bye gets away with a half volley on the pads and the ball nearly evades a diving Wade Johnson to Jamshed, OUT he's fallen three short of a century! Johnson pitched it up outside the off stump, Jamshed wanted to clear the infield again on seeing mid-off up, didn't time it at all and didn't get the elevation, tamely chipped it to Star Pattinson to Shafiq, OUT timber! The middle stump is flattened, Shafiq reaches out a drive a length ball through the off side, gets a thick inside edge and his middle stump is knocked back by a couple of yards Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 wide lands it full and wide outside the off stump and he leaves it alone because it was too wide to chase Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 leg bye drifts on the pads and he tucks it down to short fine leg Starc to Azhar Ali, 1 wide yet another wide, 20th so far, down the leg side and Pakistan inch closer Having said that, a deserved victory for Pakistan. A crucial DRS reversal proved the turning point as Jamshed wisely challenged the LBW early in the innings and went on to score an entertaining 97. He should never have been given out in the first place. A That's it from us here. It's been a really really long night. Goes without saying really. Catch the decider in Sharjah on Monday.

Despite being confounded by Saeed Ajmal again, Australia's batsmen posted a reasonable total of 248 for 9, but Jamshed and Azhar Ali helped Pakistan secure a seven-wicket win that meant the series would be decided in the final match. Jamshed fell just short of a century, lobbing a catch to mid-off when he had 97 and Pakistan needed a further 82 runs, but Azhar and the captain Misbah-ul-Haq ensured Jamshed's fine work was not wasted. Facing Mitchell Johnson after 2am should be a daunting prospect but the humidity appeared to sap Australia's bowlers of all their energy - at one point Mitchell Starc hunched over and left the field exhausted during his over - and Azhar and Misbah were able to cruise to the target with 38 balls to spare."
"5.30pm Australia win the toss and bat first today. They are unchanged. As are Bangladesh. Mahedi Hasan to Carey, OUT taken at mid-on! Mahedi gets Carey again. Full outside, looked to drag it over the leg side but the bat twisted and it took a thick inside edge Mustafizur to Philippe, OUT takes leg stump! Magnificently done from Mustafizur. Philippe got in all sorts of a mess. A short-of-a-length delivery, he moved across the crease a touch and shaped to play to the leg side but was completely done by the slower ball. Brilliant bowling. Quick spin bowling. Shakib to Henriques, OUT slows it down and Henriques misses the slog sweep totally. Full just outside off but angling in with the arm. Henriques goes across and gets down to hammer it through the leg side. Under the bat, past his body, and into off stump Shoriful Islam to Marsh, OUT big swing to the leg side but outside edge to the keeper. Length ball on off, and tries to hit it over midwicket, but with the ball angling away he had to get closer to the line to play it in that direction. Faint edge to the keeper and that's Marsh out on 45 for the second time in two days Mustafizur to Wade, OUT leg stump cartwheeling! Full on off, and he walks across to the off side to try and paddle it to fine leg. Misses the shot, and the ball crashes into leg Mustafizur to Agar, OUT Ashton leaves Ashton! Good length, outside off. Agar tentatively looks to cut it square, but there's a bit of extra bounce despite the slower ball, and it hits the glove. Pops up in the air towards the keeper and that's something his five-year old self could've also taken Mustafizur to Starc, 1 wide slower ball, full outside leg, and rolls towards the keeper Shoriful Islam to Turner, OUT back of a length outside off. Angling away and he tries to cut it over the off side. Spooned up in the air, and cover backtracks to take a simple one Mustafizur to Tye, 1 leg bye full, pitched outside leg and hits the pad before rolling over to point. LBW appeal turned down but no way that was out What Australia now need are wickets at the top, and then get Shakib-Mahmudullah early as well, to have any chance of a win. Batting isn't easy over here but given Bangladesh know what rate they have to score at, they will feel comfortable earning the W. Zampa to Mahedi Hasan, SIX runs that's more like it! No doubts this time, that's well back over long-off...good footwork and a clean swing through the line Tye to Nurul, 1 wide back of a length on middle, and goes over his shoulders to the keeper. Just down the leg side, reckons the umpire Starc to Afif, 1 wide full, outside leg and going further down leg. Misses the flick, and wide once more Tye to Afif, 1 wide back of a length, outside leg stump. Walks across to pull towards fine leg but misses. Gets the wide though 9.30pm A fist pump between the two youngsters who have dragged Bangladesh out of a very deep hole. Even Justin Langer is applauding them. A lone fan is flying the flag on a nearly building's roof. Imagine if we had a full crowd today! The partnership is unbeaten on 56.... to win from 67/5 with Australia's bowlers roaring, it needed a special effort. That's all from myself Sreshth, Andrew McGlashan and Ranjith P. Remember there's plenty of cricket happening. England v India and the Hundred. Hop over there to enjoy more cricket. See you! Bangladesh won by 5 wickets (with 8 balls remaining) Player of the match is Afif Hossain, BDESH","Bangladesh 123 for 5 (Afif 37*) beat Australia 121 for 7 (Marsh 45, Mustafizur 3-23) by five wickets You wait years for a T20 victory over Australia then two come along at once. Bangladesh stumbled but eventually found composure in their chase to take a 2-0 lead in Dhaka with Afif Hossain and Nurul Hasan guiding them home with eight balls to spare. The pitch - a new one - was again slow, although looked rather less slow when Mitchell Starc was racing in with the new ball after Australia's batting had laboured to post 121, in which Mustafizur Rahman was outstanding. At 67 for 5 the chase was wobbling significantly but with such a small target, the required rate was never an issue and the sixth-wicket pair managed to show a calmness that had eluded a few others. After struggling in the Powerplay, Australia had given themselves a foundation to launch in the closing overs with a stand of 57 between Mitchell Marsh and Moises Henriques, and with a fair wind 140 would have been achievable."
"Starc to Bairstow, 1 wide wanders way down leg and it's credit to Wade's prep behind the scenes that he's able to dive across and stop five wides. Hazlewood to Banton, OUT caught behind!. Brilliant work from Hazlewood. Pitching it up. Inviting the drive. Batsmen in this format need no second invitation but Banton here finds that a little bit of away movement is enough to take his outside edge. As he walks back, he may even wonder if that was full enough to be going gung ho like that. Hazlewood to Bairstow, 1 leg bye fired in straight, 84mph/136kph and deflected behind square on the leg side Starc to Ali, OUT swung high into the leg side, Smith is under it at deep midwicket... taken on rope despite a juggle! Or was it? The TV umpire is going to take a long look at this. Smith was very close as he took catch, his heel right on the boundary marker, and did it just touch? He then tossed the ball up and walked in to catch it a second time, just to be sure. But there's no conclusive evidence and after Rashid to Finch, 1 wide slider down the leg side, Finch sweeps at it and Bairstow bellows out an insistent appeal! Not given, umpire Saggers signals wide, but England review. Did Finch catch up with it on the way past? No, says the technology! Very close but he didn't get anything on it Wood to Marsh, SIX runs nailed over cow corner for a flat six! Wood digs it in but Marsh was waiting for it and properly smoked his pull Australia won by 5 wickets (with 3 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Marsh, AUS","Australia 146 for 5 (Marsh 39*, Finch 39, Rashid 3-21) beat England 145 for 6 (Bairstow 55, Denly 29*, Zampa 2-34) by five wickets A cool-headed knock by Mitchell Marsh handed Australia a consolation win worth more than just that to the tourists in the third and final T20I against England at the Ageas Bowl. A superb spell from Adil Rashid yielded three wickets and gave Australia a big scare, especially given their failure to chase down a modest target in the opening match of the series. But Marsh, playing his first T20I since February, carried them over the line by five wickets with just three balls to spare with his unbeaten 39 off 36 balls. Aaron Finch sends a pull off Jofra Archer soaring AFP via Getty Images There's nothing like bragging rights (of sorts) being on the line to fire up an Australian team. With England already having sealed the series, Tuesday's result made it 2-1 but also wrested back the World No."
"Toss: Misbah has won the toss and Pakistan will bat first. Two fast bowlers and three spinners are in and so is Kamran Akmal. Clarke's not that disappointed to be bowling first. He says it's cooler than yesterday. Pattinson to Azhar Ali, OUT and another soft dismissal! Chipped to mid-on, it was shaping in full on the pads and Azhar was looking to chip it over the on side, the trouble was the bat turned as he made contact and hence mistimed it, Johnson jogged to his right and caught it on the fall Starc to Jamshed, OUT good comeback by Starc and better reflexes from Wade! Starc hit the deck harder this time to vary his length, there was extra bounce which Jamshed wasn't ready for, he tried to fend it off outside the off stump but the ball took the top half of the bat and Wade jumped to his left and took it Maxwell to Shafiq, SIX runs take that! Tossed up on middle and leg and he whams it with the turn over deep midwicket, lots of intent on that shot Christian to Misbah, OUT Christian breaks the stand and Misbah perishes trying to be aggressive, Christian took a lot of pace off the ball with his offcutter, the keeper was up to the stumps to stifle the batsman, Misbah tried to hoick it over the on side and got a thick inside edge to the stumps Pattinson to Umar Akmal, 1 wide starts off with a wide down the leg side, it's the first wide of the innings by the way Starc to Shafiq, OUT and the start of the Powerplay brings a wicket! Shafiq was trying to repeat the shot from the previous ball, made a lot of room to spank it through cover, Starc fired it full and on the stumps from round the wicket, Shafiq made no contact and lost his stumps Starc to Kamran, 1 wide bangs it in short down the leg side and wide called Pattinson to Umar Akmal, 2 wide bit of an anticlimax, Pattinson loses complete control of that one and sprays it well wide of the leg stump, work for Wade who does well Starc to Kamran, OUT very soft dismissal in the end! Starc pitched it on a good length from round the wicket, Kamran was trying to tuck it over the on side but he ended up playing it too early and tamely chipped it to Clarke at midwicket Starc to Afridi, OUT gone first ball! Clever move to bring in a slip because he has hit it straight there! Starc went back to over the wicket for Afridi, pitched it up on the off stump and drew him forward to drive, thick outside edge to Clarke, great captaincy and Starc has four wickets Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT Starc picks up five! Starc continues his round the wicket line to Umar Akmal, he sprays it full and wide and invites the lofted shot, Umar made room and tried to clear the infield but didn't get the elevation, straight to Bailey at cover Johnson to Tanvir, OUT the decline continues! Poor shot by Tanvir, not sure what he was attempting there, made room and tried to scoop it over mid-on, miscued it and Hussey ran across to his right and took a simple catch Johnson to Cheema, 4 leg byes drifts down the leg side from round the wicket, Cheema turned at the crease and the ball clipped the pads and raced to fine leg Pattinson to Ajmal, OUT well we didn't need the extra time after all! Pattinson fires it full and straight on the leg stump, Ajmal couldn't resist the big shot but played too early, the ball went straight through and pushed back the leg stump Tanvir to Warner, 1 wide slides it wide down the leg side, Pakistan have already conceded their first wide, Australia bowled their first wide late into the innings Tanvir to Wade, 1 leg bye drifts on the pads and the ball deflects off his legs to the on side Tanvir to Warner, 1 wide bad ball, too wide down the leg side, he couldn't have chased it even if he wanted to Tanvir to Clarke, 1 wide he slides down the leg side again, these wides won't help Pakistan's cause Ajmal to Hussey, OUT the spinners have really pulled things back here! Caught at slip, after inducing an edge off Clarle earlier in the over Ajmal gets one off Hussey, Hussey didn't read the doosra, he was forward to defend and the outside edge went straight to Misbah at first slip Ajmal to Clarke, 2 wide loses control of that and slides it wide down the leg side Ajmal to Maxwell, 1 bye that was down the leg side and Maxwell was trying an expansive reverse sweep, missed the bat and the ball clipped Kamran's pads and rolled to the on side, you should have seen Ajmal's glare at the batsman! Tanvir to Bailey, 1 leg bye bowls the leg cutter from round the wicket, hits him high on the thigh, they pick up a leg bye Ajmal to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell has thrown it away with a reverse sweep! Ajmal was bowling round the wicket, the batsman missed it completely and was struck in line with the stumps, not sure why Maxwell attempted this stunt yet again against Ajmal. But hang on...that pitched outside the leg stump, so Bowden didn't exactly get it right there Pakistan will look back at this and point to the fact that they failed to bat out 50 overs. Who knows what might have happened if they had added at least 20 more? Their bowlers and fielders did the best they could. The batsmen didn't. Stay with us for the presentation. That's it from us here. Thanks for the mails. You can read the match report once it's updated. Cheers!

The frenzied conclusion of Pakistan's innings contrasted with the composure shown by Michael Clarke's team, who took a major step towards preserving an unbeaten record against the subcontinental side that has lasted since 2002. While Clarke played a critical role, notching a fluent 66 when all around him looked fraught in the face of Pakistan's spin, it was equally heartening for the Australians that the less seasoned George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell supplied the game-clinching stand. Maxwell perished to an impetuous reverse sweep with the win in sight, but Dan Christian kept Bailey company until the final runs were collected, with four wickets and 10 balls to spare. Australia owed much, too, to Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson, who snipped the top off the Pakistan innings with the new ball then strangling the middle order in the batting Powerplay on the way to rounding up Misbah-ul-Haq's men for 198 in 45."
"Shapoor to Warner, OUT that's out, there was a noise, short of a length, tried to chop it through point, a faint nick through the keeper, big cheers all round, there's a trumpet blowing somewhere, Shapoor Zadran's ecstatic M Nabi to Wade, OUT Wade goes, a soft dismissal in the end, bowled it quicker and it was struck well but straight back to the bowler, Nabi reacted well to bend low and take it clean M Nabi to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell has holed out, struck it very well but didn't get the elevation he wanted, struck it flat, tempted by the flight and played it straight down long-on's throat Samiullah Shinwari to Clarke, OUT stumped, Clarke just kept walking, was done in by the spin, it turned away as he charged down the pitch to launch him over midwicket, missed, the keeper collected, he was in no hurry to take down the stumps as Clarke had given up and began walking, four down now Zadran to Hussey, 1 leg bye down the leg side again and Hussey misses out, fails to help it past short fine, one more leg bye Shapoor to Bailey, OUT gets the yorker right but after being hit around, in the blockhole on middle, Bailey fails to dig it out and the stumps take a beating Sadiq to Hussey, SIX runs full toss on the off and Hussey deals with it, thrashes it over long-on for another six, cleanly struck Sadiq to Hussey, OUT bowled'im, misses his half-century, shortish on the off, moves away to chop that through point, gets an inside edge onto the stumps Sadiq to Pattinson, OUT Another wicket for Sadiq, slogs at that one, it's a straight ball from round the wicket, misses it completely and is bowled Afghanistan seem fairly satisfied with that effort. A good performance from Sadiq, who was economical. But Australia have a very good score on a slow pitch. Afghanistan fought back to pick up those three wickets in the batting Powerplay, but that stand between Michael Hussey and George Bailey boosted them to a Starc to Sadiq, 1 bye goodish length outside off, tries to crash it through extra cover, misses and so does Wade, who concedes a bye, good carry there Johnson to Asghar, 1 wide drops that short, too high and it's called a wide, Stanikzai hooks and misses Pattinson to Mangal, OUT trapped in front, Pattinson pushes that full, on middle and leg, Mangal gets a little across, is on the crease when he misses and it strikes him on the pads, the only question was whether it missed leg. Unlikely, and that's what the umpire thinks as well, one more goes Johnson to Asghar, 1 leg bye angling in towards middle, clipped that behind square leg for a single into the deep Starc to M Nabi, 1 leg bye tries to work it away into the leg side, struck on the pads but it would have been going down, they collect a leg-bye Johnson to Samiullah Shinwari, 1 wide drops that short and it's down the leg side, called a wide Johnson to Samiullah Shinwari, 1 wide down the leg side again and the umpire isn't going to spare those Johnson to Zadran, OUT appeal for a catch, Bowden raises his finger after an eternity, there was an outside edge surely but did the ball bounce on its way to the keeper, poked at a fullish delivery. Did the ball bump into the ground before getting to the keeper? Bowden ultimately thinks not, we need ano Starc to Samiullah Shinwari, 1 wide shortish and down the leg side from round the wicket, called a wide Pattinson to Gulbadin, SIX runs what a shot! Naib and Pattinson are having a bit of a tiff here, short on middle and he got into position early to dispatch it over the deep midwicket fence Pattinson to Gulbadin, SIX runs another six, a full toss this time and he gives it the treatment, launches that beautifully over wide long-on Pattinson to Gulbadin, OUT short and Naib shapes up for a cut, there was an edge, a clear sound as he went for it, Wade dived low and to his left to catch that, the umpires are trying to verify if it carried, they've gone to the third umpire. Replays show it was a clean catch, he's got to go The four early wickets pegged Afghanistan back early but from there on we saw some fight from them.

But the key word is eventually, as Afghanistan proved a more than worthy opponent capable of exposing flaws in this Australia side during a spirited run chase. Australia were in control thanks to the contrasting styles of Matthew Wade and Michael Clarke, who each posted 75, and the indefatigable Michael Hussey (49), as they set an impressive total of 273 on a sluggish surface in oppressive conditions, before the pace and swing of Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson ripped through the Afghanistan top order to leave them reeling at 49 for 4. But this team that has ascended from rubble, through lowly ICC division five cricket to the World Twenty20, showed its incredible fighting spirit, exemplified by Asghar Stanikzai and Mohammad Nabi."
"3pm Time for the toss...heads call AB de Villiers but it lands a tail. Australia have won the toss and have decided to bowl first. Xavier Doherty comes in for Dan Christian to add an extra spin option for them. For South Africa, AB reckons he would have batted first anyway and brings in Wayne Parnell for Albie Morkel. Doherty to Kallis, OUT oh edged and gone and Doherty gets another. It's a cracking delivery, tossed up on a length just outside off, Kallis pushed at it and got a thin edge to Wade to held the chance very well, it was a decent edge. What a start for Doherty, what a selection. Beautifully bowled, flighted nicely and a little turn this time gets the edge of Kallis Watson to Amla, OUT step across the stumps, goes to pull and gloved behind! Amla falls and Watson does the job again. A shorter ball, again not coming on as the batsman might expect, Amla went across his stumps to pull into the leg side, but was through with the stroke too soon and gloved a ball to Wade and walked straight off, what a blow for Australia Doherty to Duminy, OUT and gets another one straight away! Duminy down the track gets beaten and is stumped by a country mile. More lovely flight by Doherty, drew Duminy down the pitch and he was no where near it, tried to adjust, I think the ball ended up going between his legs and my grandfather could have made that stumping with a cup of tea in one hand and a scone in the other Doherty to de Villiers, 2 wide floated up, a step to leg and a step back, goes down the leg side under the keeper's legs Cummins to Behardien, 1 wide good change of pace, it cuts down the leg side past Behardien's attempted swing to leg, called wide! Very harsh call, moved a long way from outside off that Cummins to Behardien, SIX runs and this extra ball goes out of the park, full toss outside off, and finally Behardien plays a shot in anger, swinging this wide of long on Starc to Peterson, 1 bye slower ball outside off, a huge swing from outside off is nowhere near but they go through for a bye to the keeper Steyn to Watson, 1 wide drops that one short outside off, a touch too short that and the umpire isn't going to spare that one, called a wide Morkel to Hussey, 1 wide down the leg side this time and he appeals in vain, Hussey tried to glance that down but made no contact, the umpire calls it a wide Kallis to Watson, 1 wide faint appeal for lbw, shortish outside leg stump and Watson tried to help it on its way fine but missed, may just have flicked his shirt sleeve, but the umpire reckoned that was a wide Botha to Watson, 1 wide flighted outside leg and he goes for the sweep, tries to sweep it fine, misses but it's called a wide, that spun down Parnell to Watson, SIX runs that's been hammered, he's been superb at spotting these short ones quick, pulls that high and handsome and long, over deep square leg, raises another half-century, some form he's in Parnell to Hussey, SIX runs this has been sent over deep square leg and it hits a policeman standing there after rebounding from the scoreboard, on the pads and that's picked up beautifully A comprehensive win for Australia in the end. South Africa reached a score they didn't look good to reach at one point, but despite reaching 146 they weren't able to contain a team in form. Watson, again, led the way and Hussey gave him superb support. Australia are in a great position to qualify for the semis, thanks to another convincing win. South Africa are not out, but much will depend on how the other results in the group go. A marquee clash Australia won by 8 wickets (with 14 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 147 for 2 (Watson 70) beat South Africa 146 for 5 (Peterson 32*, Doherty 3-20) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson powered Australia to another victory ICC/Getty Shane Watson has carried Australia in every match of this tournament and has now all but muscled them into the semi-finals with another outstanding all-round performance against South Africa. Watson picked up two wickets to help restrict South Africa and then crunched 70 from 47 balls to set up their successful chase of 147, as the Australians cruised to victory with 14 balls to spare. The South Africans were lacklustre with the bat and sloppy in the field, and while the result has not yet knocked them out of the tournament, they will need other results to fall their way if they are to progress to the semi-finals. For that to happen, Pakistan would need to lose to both India and Australia, and South Africa would need to beat India and then hope their net run-rate was good enough to sneak them ahead of Pakistan and India. By the same token, the win has not technically confirmed Australia's place in the semi-finals, but their very strong net run-rate meant that for them to miss out, not only would India need to beat both Pakistan and South Africa but Australia would also need a disaster in their last match against Pakistan."
"Maxwell to Pathan, 1 leg bye full, on the pads, turns a little, beats a half-sweep, concedes a leg-bye Cummins to Dhoni, OUT pressure of dot balls there. This is a wide half-volley, might even have been called wide had he not driven at it. No feet means he is reaching out, and manages just a limp hit straight to extra cover Watson to Yuvraj, OUT Bouncer is back. Hello. And so is Watson's golden arm. Digs this in, Yuvraj likes the drop in pace from Cummins, and he top-edges it to deep midwicket Watson to Pathan, OUT Watson strikes again. India might even be thankful that Pathan is out. Memories of Ravindra Jadeja's promotion all those years ago when he tried his best to hit out but just couldn't. This is full, on the pads, flicked away, straight to short midwicket Starc to Rohit Sharma, OUT played all around it. Wide of the crease, slightly low arm, angled in towards top of off, Sharma just misses the line completely, the bat coming down from slips, but looking to play straight. The off stump goes for a walk. Australia on a hat-trick 9.02pm Australia will be pleased with their effort here, but India are not entirely out of it either. They know if they can get a couple of wickets early, their spinners can control the game. An interesting second half is set up. See you in 10 minutes Khan to Watson, 1 wide big wide outside off, Watson tries to hit it, but can't Chawla to Watson, SIX runs welcome to the crease. You may as well give the red rag to a bull. Long hop, middle and leg, to Watson. Need I mention what happened after that? Chawla to Watson, SIX runs wide half-volley, Watson is not going to respect them. Slog-sweeps it dead straight for a flat six Australia enjoying it thoroughly. They have mauled India on a slow track after losing the toss. And before the start of the match, Australia were ranked No. 9 to India's No. 3 Australia won by 9 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 141 for 1 (Watson 72, Warner 63*) beat India 140 for 7 (Pathan 31, Watson 3-34) by 9 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson was again Man of the Match AFP Australia's captain George Bailey doesn't think his side is over-dependent on Shane Watson. Who'd be able to tell? Watson has hardly given any of his team-mates a chance so far in this tournament, and that continued in Australia's first Super Eights match as they crushed India by nine wickets in Colombo. To be fair, David Warner was also outstanding and Pat Cummins played a key role with the ball. But Watson was again the stand-out performer, as he has been in all of Australia's matches in the World Twenty20. Chasing 141, the Australians reached their target with 31 balls to spare."
"West Indies have won the toss, and have chosen to bat first. Here are the teams Starc to Smith, OUT that's a right riper from Start. A ball and a half. Length ball, just outside off, swings in late, leaves Smith stunned, and hits the top of off. Smith is clearly surprised by this late movement Hogg to Samuels, OUT Hogg gets Samuels who hasn't always picked the senior spinner. Samuels leaves the crease this time, the ball is flatter, falls slightly shorter than he expects it, and the mis-hit carries to long-on Christian to Gayle, 1 leg bye Gayle backs away, looks to pull, seems to have been beaten by low bounce, but gets a leg-bye Watson to Pollard, OUT Michael Hussey, what a cricketer. This is a low full toss, Pollard flicks it in the air, Hussey charges in from deep midwicket, and completes a low catch diving forward Cummins to Bravo, OUT timbahhh. Cummins bowls slightly short of a length, Bravo makes room, looks to go ever extra cover. Bravo misses, the ball hits the top of middle and leg Starc to Ramdin, OUT more timber. Ramdin backs away big time, Starc stays full and straight, and hits the base of middle and leg. Cant blame Ramdin much, but Starc is on a hat-trick West Indies would have taken 191 had you offered them that before the innings. Bit how they kept going despite falls of wickets. Gayle, Samuels, Bravo, Pollard, Sammy... they were like a battery. How much will they rue that dropped catch off Gayle. Watson was the culprit, and pretty soon he will get a chance to make up for it with the bat. Do stay around Rampaul to Warner, SIX runs this is a crazy game. Short, into the ribs, and he has short-arm pulled it over deep square leg. Top timing Edwards to Warner, OUT Warner is not going anywhere, but the finger has gone up. Stands, smiles wryly, and walks off. He is not happy, is Warner. This is a length ball outside off, Warner plays for the swing and tries the big booming drive. The ball doesn't quite come in, and Edwards and Ramdin are fairly certain he has nicked it. So is Asad Rauf. But Warner is raging. The 10.30pm Still sheeting down and David Hopps has spotted a fan in football jersey body-surfing on the covers. On a more serious note David lets me know the October monsoon is just setting in Sri Lanka, and this is not good news for the tournament. Also don't forget the Champions Cup that was washed out in Sri Lanka ended on September 30, which was roughly the same season. Not the Gayle, Samuels were superb, and so was Watson. For a nine-over innings, as it turned out to be, Warner was useful too. Unfortunate day for the bowlers what with mis-hits flying for sixes. Stay back for quotes from the presentation Okay so that's it. A cold tournament finally reaches biggish matches, and rain allows only 43 overs of cricket over two matches. I have got a bad feeling about this tournament. Hoping for a better day tomorrow, this is Sidharth Monga signing off. Cheers Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 100 for 1 (Watson 41*) beat West Indies 191 for 8 (Gayle 54, Samuels 50, Starc 3-35) by 17 runs (D/L method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson was Man of the Match for his 41 not out and 2 for 29 Getty Images Another fine all-round effort from Shane Watson steered Australia into the Super Eights as they claimed a Duckworth-Lewis victory over West Indies in Colombo. Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels both scored quick half-centuries to put up a hefty score of 191 but a strong start from Australia, who reached 100 for 1, was enough to ensure they were ahead when the rain started bucketing down in the tenth over of the chase. On a day when South Africa and Sri Lanka's match was reduced to an absurd seven-over-a-side battle, this game had all the ingredients for a thriller until the weather intervened. Australia were pursuing what would have been the fifth-highest successful run chase in T20 international history, while West Indies at the halfway mark appeared well-placed to open their campaign with a victory. They must now defeat Ireland on Monday to join Australia in the next stage."
"Ireland have won the toss and decided to bat. Just waiting on confirmation of their team. Apologies for the delay here, bit of a problem with information from the ground. Watson to Porterfield, OUT gone! First ball. Perfect start for Australia. Was dropped in short, Porterfield responded with a hook, gets a top edge and it is comfortably taken by long leg Starc to Stirling, OUT another catch in the deep, this time at third man. Was a hint of width outside off, Stirling through his hands through a drive and it skewed high down towards Watson who ran around the boundary and held an excellent catch Maxwell to Joyce, OUT very soft...tossed up on off stump, Joyce tries to go over the top but can only lob his drive straight to mid-off who was inside the circle Hogg to Wilson, OUT gone! Another departs. Hogg strikes second ball. It looked pretty good, full on the stumps, straightened a fraction and Wilson was trying to play to leg. Watson to N O'Brien, OUT that's the end of that. A full ball, perhaps a slower delivery, Niall aims to swing it through the leg side in the slog-sweep position and misses Watson to K O'Brien, OUT big wicket! Excellent over from Watson. A short ball, Kevin tried to upper-cut it down to third man and was a little half-hearted in the short which led to an edge to Wade. Cummins to Johnston, 1 leg bye flicked into the leg side Starc to Johnston, OUT on target! Perfect yorker from round the wicket, right at the bottom of off stump and hits the target as Johnston tried to give himself room Cusack to Warner, 1 wide starts down the leg side with a wide, Wilson takes it neatly and whips off the bails Cusack to Warner, 1 leg bye outside leg stump, the bowler is fortunate that this takes the pad into the leg side Stirling to Watson, SIX runs now he drops short and gets pulled over the deep midwicket boundary...Watson following his wickets with a very solid innings So, that's just about it for this match. I'll hand over to my colleagues for the India-Afghanistan match which starts shortly. Enjoy the action. Australia won by 7 wickets (with 29 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 125 for 3 (Watson 51) beat Ireland 123 for 7 (Kevin O'Brien 35, Watson 3-26, Starc 2-20) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson had an impressive day, and the O'Briens were among his victims AFP A commanding performance from Shane Watson delivered a handsome opening World Twenty20 victory for Australia over Ireland, as George Bailey's team showed aggressive intent to pursue the one trophy missing from the national team's display cabinet. Ireland had fancied their chances of upsetting Australia, but were left with their odds of progression diminished and their ears ringing from a few verbal barbs delivered by opponents in no mood to be accommodating to a team they had briefly been ranked below on the ICC's T20 rankings earlier this month. Watson influenced proceedings from the first ball of the match, a bouncer Ireland's captain Will Porterfield hooked to fine leg. He returned to the bowling crease to snuff out a mid-innings revival, then smashed 51 to ensure a modest chase that never assumed anything more than nuisance dimensions. Mitchell Starc and Hogg also delivered telling spells to help keep Ireland quiet, their 20 overs devoid of sustained momentum save for a rearguard stand of 50 between Kevin and Niall O'Brien from the depths of 33 for 4."

Abhishek Purohit signing off. Cheers Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 168 for 7 (Warner 59, Watson 47, Ajmal 2-19) beat Pakistan 74 (Starc 3-11, Cummins 3-15) by 94 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Starc picked up three wickets as Australia dismissed Pakistan for 74 AFP Australia began the series with one of their worst Twenty20 losses but they finished it with their second-best win in the format, crushing Pakistan by 94 runs in the dead rubber in Dubai. David Warner and Shane Watson set up the victory with an Australian-record opening partnership before Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc ran through Pakistan, who suffered their worst defeat in a T20 international and were all out for 74, their lowest total in the format. Pakistan still won the series 2-1 but if the old sporting clich? that you're only as good as your last performance can be trusted, the Australians will be reasonably happy when they arrive in Sri Lanka in the next few days for the ICC World Twenty20. The fact that Warner and Watson both fired and found their six-hitting rhythm would be especially pleasing for the captain George Bailey, although some more runs from the middle order would have been preferable. Cummins was outstanding with the new ball as Pakistan slumped to 19 for 5 in the chase, and Brad Hogg's 1 for 11 - the most economical four-over spell by an Australian in a T20 international - was another positive sign for the Australians."
"7.30pm Pakistan win the toss and choose to bat. Pakistan have made no changes to the side, that means they still have four spinners in the XI. Starc to Imran Nazir, 1 wide this time it is a wide, swinging down the leg side Starc to Imran Nazir, OUT brilliant delivery from Starc, that one swung one and Nazir was clueless about it, through the bat and pad gap and it crashes into middle stump, what a start to Starc's international T20 career, a duck for Imran Nazir Cummins to Jamshed, OUT sensational catch from Dan Christian, even he can't believe it, a massive grin on his face as he gets up after plucking that one-handed blinder, set to be a Youtube classic that, Jamshed scooped that one over mid-off, Christian had to back-pedal, he had plenty of ground to cover, he wasn't going to make it so he puts in a full-length dive and stretches out his left hand, it sticks, Watson to Hafeez, OUT this time Australia take the catch, David Warner at long-on,Hafeez plays an ugly slog, the boundaries are massive here, there isn't enough on that to clear the rope, Warner was waiting, takes a good low catch, Watson will be relieved his drop in the previous over didn't cost him team that much Christian to Umar Akmal, OUT starts the over with wicket, slapped right to deep midwicket and Umar Akmal has to go, a slower delivery, length, that is right off the middle of the bat, but that isn't good enough to clear the rope Hafeez to Hussey, SIX runs massive from Hussey, Warner started by smashing Hafeez's first ball for six, Hussey does the same, but this time he hits it even longer, much longer, on to the second tier beyond long-on Tanvir to Watson, SIX runs a length ball from Tanvir, Watson goes downtown, doesn't hit it as powerfully as his previous six, this time Umar Akmal was interested at long-on, but that had enough to clear that fielder Abdul Razzaq to Bailey, OUT Razzaq strikes first ball, the birthday boy can't finish it, a slower short ball outside off, Bailey goes for the pull, a top edge and that sails towards midwicket, the substitute Arafat is everywhere, he takes the catch, Australia's bowlers will have to do the job with the bat now, you wouldn't believe the noise levels in Dubai Abdul Razzaq to Cummins, OUT it's a Superover, it wasn't the best final ball form Razzaq but it was good enough, a full toss on the pads, Cummins was looking to work that to the leg side, a leading edge that ballons towards mid-off, Imran Nazir and Umar Akmal both went for it, Nazir called for it, Umar backed away, Nazir takes it, Cummins wrings his hands in disappointment, this has been some game Australia will bat first in the Superover. Match tied (Pakistan won the one-over eliminator) Player of the match is Saeed Ajmal, PAK","Pakistan 151 for 4 (Hafeez 45, Jamshed 45) beat Australia 151 for 8 (Bailey 42, Ajmal 2-20) through Super Over Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Pakistan's top order provided the platform for a big score AFP Seldom has the fickleness of Twenty20 been more evident. Pakistan claimed the series against Australia, but did so in circumstances as far removed from the hiding dealt out in the first match as could be imagined. Mohammad Hafeez's team celebrated their victory in the minutes after midnight in Dubai, yet George Bailey's Australians could also take solace from a much-improved display. Two days after being routed for 89 on the way to a seven-wicket hiding, Australia scrapped to an enthralling tie. They owed much to the captain George Bailey, who on his 30th birthday compiled the most critical and substantial innings of his T20 career to date, proving his worth as a batsman as well as a captain in the process."
"Archer to Warner, OUT given caught behind, and Warner has reviewed straight away! He made the call in the instant he was given. Another cracking delivery, short of a length, nips back at Warner and beats the inside edge, but the replay shows that glanced the glove! Wood to Carey, OUT edged, caught behind! What a start from England. Carey tries to give himself a touch of room to the leg side, shapes a drive at a good-length delivery but can only get a thin nick to Buttler Tom Curran to Smith, SIX runs clears deep square leg! Terrific pull shot by Smith, the delivery wasn't that short, just back of a length and swung away Rashid to Finch, SIX runs thumped down the ground! Finch leaves this crease and leaves a mark on Rashid, swung mightily over long-on, despite there being a man back Jordan to Finch, OUT dragged on! Short ball, coming back in at pace, Finch seems surprised by it and can only chop down into his timbers! Jordan roars in celebration, that's a big breakthrough, with Australia rebuilding nicely Rashid to Stoinis, OUT steered to slip, Rashid again finishes his spell with a wicket! Stoinis hangs his head but that was indicative of his struggles against spin... hung back, spotted too late that it was a big-turning legbreak, could only watch in horror as he directed it straight to Malan, diving to his right Jordan to Maxwell, OUT heaves at a length ball, nicked to the keeper! Unusual dismissal at this stage of the innings, but it'll work for England... Jordan hitting that hard length again, as he did at the death on Friday, and Maxwell is too leg side as he swings for the hills and edges through. Was seeing it well, but that's going to dent Australia's hopes of getting 150 Archer to Agar, 1 wide round the wicket, 90mph/145kph but sliding down the leg side Archer to Cummins, SIX runs Woof! Smoked down the ground! Cummins sets himself and thrashes another length ball back over the bowler's head... Shot, sir Archer to Cummins, 2 wide sprays this down the leg side, Buttler can't grab it cleanly... more extras in the over, Archer not enjoying this quite so much now Kane Richardson to Buttler, SIX runs and that breaks the run of dots...a dismissive thump over mid-on from a perfectly good length delivery, Buttler got onto the front foot and crunched it down the ground. Into the rope on the full Cummins to Malan, 1 wide banged in short, flies over Malan's head and it's called wide on height Starc to Buttler, 1 wide dug in short, Buttler swings and can't connect... wide on height Starc to Buttler, 1 leg bye speared into the pads, deflected into the leg side for a leg bye England won by 6 wickets (with 7 balls remaining) Player of the match is Jos Buttler, ENG","England 158 for 4 (Buttler 77*, Malan 42) beat Australia 157 for 7 (Finch 40, Stoinis 35) by six wickets Jos Buttler led England to a series win with seven balls and one game to spare against Australia at the Ageas Bowl, stroking a fluent 77 not out in a comfortable chase of 158. Buttler started surprisingly slowly in the run chase, reaching the halfway mark on just 25 from 24 balls, but put his foot on the gas in the back half, pacing his innings to perfection despite a slight wobble as England lost three wickets in 22 balls. Australia recovered from 3 for 2 and 30 for 3 to reach 157 after choosing to bat first, after Jofra Archer and Mark Wood ripped through the top order in a frighteningly quick new-ball spell. Aaron Finch and Marcus Stoinis' innings helped them to a respectable score, but it never looked like being enough. England lightning-fast start Powerplay wickets have been a real problem for England this calendar year: coming into this game, they had taken only three in 36 overs, and Eoin Morgan had repeated highlighted new-ball bowling as an area for improvement."

Not since the second T20 international ever played had Australia scored as few in an innings as the 89 for which they were dismissed in this match, and although Pakistan lost three wickets in the chase they were never in danger of losing. They cruised to the target with 31 balls to spare. Statistics don't always mean much in T20 but the story of this match could be summed up with a few numbers. It was the first time since another loss to Pakistan in Dubai in May 2009 that Australia failed to hit a six in a T20 innings."
"Johnson to Hafeez, 1 wide short, but miles down the leg side, he thinks to swing it around the corner for a moment, lets it go Maxwell to Jamshed, 3 wide that has been fired in round-armish from round the stumps, way down the leg side, little chance for the keeper, rolls off his gloves Pattinson to Hafeez, SIX runs that is an outstanding stroke from a batsman who has struggled for timing throughout his innings, short of a length, almost as if he was waiting for it, Hafeez stands in the crease and wallops it high over midwicket, there is a man Johnson to Jamshed, OUT another short ball, and this time he's got him, Mitch smiles widely, sharp sharp bouncer head high, Jamshed tried to hook, keeper takes it safely Johnson to Afridi, 1 wide angled across, wide outside off, too far Johnson to Afridi, OUT short ball hammered straight to deep midwicket, sigh, that is it for the crowd, pulling off the front foot, and picking out deep midwicket perfectly Clarke to Hafeez, OUT loud appeal and Clarke strikes second ball, big strike too, Hafeez lunging forward to paddle a full delivery, missed, and was struck in front of middle and off, given by the umpire, Hafeez reviews, not much doubt about that one, Pakistan lo Clarke to Shafiq, 1 bye missed stumping chance, Clarke beats him with lots of flight outside off, he drives expecting the turn, it goes straight, keeper fails to collect, back foot was out for some time Starc to Shafiq, OUT flicked straight to short fine leg, angled in on a length into the pads from round the stumps, he plays the stroke with a flourish and finds the fielder, walks back disappointed Starc to Umar Akmal, OUT that is a wicket thrown away, second ball to the crease, Umar Akmal wants to power a short ball over deep midwicket, hits it straight to the man in the deep Starc to Misbah, OUT holes out to long off, pitched up full, Misbah winds up for the big swing but mistimes it for the fielder to come in and take it Starc to Kamran, OUT another beauty, Starc is wound up, he is visibly tired, but he produces another ripper, angled in again, straightens just enough to beat the forward push and this time, it strikes off Pakistan were 140 for 1 in the 29th over. Honest. Shows just how well the openers, Hafeez and Jamshed, batted. Jamshed was in good nick, but Hafeez had a huge struggle initially. To his credit, he battled it out and prospered. And despite all the criticism he gets from Ajmal to Clarke, 1 wide, OUT got him, that instinct for skipping out gets the captain, sharp work from Kamran, Clarke misses the work to leg as the good length offbreak spins in past his pads, and Kamran is in position to take the ball and whip the bails off, Aj Ajmal to Bailey, OUT confusion, too much confusion, they have no clue what is hitting them, Australia, trying the sweep as a release stroke, doosra again, straightens on the middle stump, gloved in the air, slip has already moved to leg slip in anticipation of t Azhar Ali to Wade, 1 wide and Kamran misses a stumping, Wade walks out to one going down leg quickly, but Kamran fails to gather, Azhar has his hand on his face in anguish Abdur to Wade, OUT there is the breakthrough, Rehman has done it for Pakistan, big gap between bat and pad as Wade pushes forward eagerly to a flighted length ball, it spins in through the gate and strikes off Pakistan had their chances. They didn't review against Michael Hussey when he was plumb in front on 0. He turned the game around with Maxwell and Wade. Misbah took Ajmal off after he had bowled five overs for three wickets. Could he have given him another? Kamran misse That is all from us for this game. Abhishek Purohit signing off. Cheers. Australia won by 3 wickets (with 18 balls remaining) Player of the match is Michael Hussey, AUS","Australia 250 for 7 (Hussey 65, Maxwell 56*, Ajmal 3-37) beat Pakistan 244 for 7 (Hafeez 78, Jamshed 48, Starc 4-51) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mohammad Hafeez and Nasir Jamshed added 129 at the top Associated Press A little calmer when it mattered most, Australia completed a victory more testing than the scoreboard ultimately showed to defeat Pakistan in Sharjah and claim the overnight ODI series 2-1. It was a result achieved as much by perspiration as inspiration, Michael Hussey and the nerveless tyro Glenn Maxwell forming the critical union to rescue their team from the uncertainty of 159 for 5 when Matthew Wade fell to Abdur Rehman. Michael Hussey could so easily have been out lbw to Saeed Ajmal before he had scored, amid a mesmerising spell in which the offspinner claimed what appeared a pivotal 3 for 11. But Misbah-ul-Haq made a pair of judgements that were to prove too timid - failing to refer the umpire Billy Bowden's decision, and then taking Ajmal off after five overs when another wicket or two might have sealed Australia's fate. Pakistan's hesitation could perhaps be attributed to the weight of history, having not defeated Australia in an ODI series since 2002."
"Out come Darren Sammy and George Bailey along with Ranjan Madugalle, the match referee. Bailey spins the coin, Sammy calls heads and heads it is. So Sammy has won the toss and West Indies are batting first. Sammy says this pitch looks like a Trinidad wicket. Just the one expected change for West Indies: Dwayne Bravo in for his broth Starc to Charles, 1 wide this one swings away. Really full, and starts wide too, and called wide Starc to Charles, OUT Charles is gone. Starc has struck. Perhaps this attack is too good for him. Starc has been swinging the ball back in, but this is short of a length, and goes with the angle. All Charles manages is an edge through to Wade Watson to Samuels, 1 leg bye length ball, into the pads, that was a freebie, but he concedes just the leg-bye Watson to Gayle, 1 leg bye appeal for leg-before, but this is short of a length, not swinging, and hitting middle and leg, so it has to be pitched outside leg Cummins to Samuels, OUT Timbahhh. Slower ball at 116ks, and the middle stump lays flat. Samuels plays the odd ungainly slog this time, and is comprehensively deceived by the slower one Starc to Gayle, 5 wide you can't swing it from there. Full, well down leg, five wides Cummins to Bravo, OUT good field placement. It's Bailey himself at straight extra cover and Bravo has hit this length ball straight to him. Some relief for Australia, but West Indies keep coming at you with their big hitters: Pollard, Russell and Sammy to follow Watson to Pollard, 2 byes slower bouncer, Pollard sways out of it, Wade gets it on a half-volley, and lets two byes through. Gets the look from Watson Cummins to Gayle, 1 wide called a wide. Cummins bowls the bouncer, Gayle ducks under it. Too high it is Starc to Gayle, SIX runs Length ball, into the pads, gone. Can't bowl length to him. Gayle has flicked this, merely flicked this, into the West Indies dugout around the midwicket area Doherty to Pollard, OUT oh finally a mis-hit finds a fielder. Pollard is looking for a fourth straight six, but this time he slices it high, high, high, and Warner takes a safe catch at long-off. Warner will have to do much more with the bat if we are going to have a match tonight Starc to Charles, 1 wide this one swings away. Really full, and starts wide too, and called wide Watson to Charles, 1 leg bye Charles moves well across to a full delivery, and lucky the ball is too straight, otherwise he would have been lbw Starc to Gayle, 1 wide dug in again, looking to tuck him up, but strays too far down leg Starc to Charles, OUT Charles is gone. Starc has struck. Perhaps this attack is too good for him. Starc has been swinging the ball back in, but this is short of a length, and goes with the angle. All Charles manages is an edge through to Wade Watson to Samuels, 1 leg bye length ball, into the pads, that was a freebie, but he concedes just the leg-bye Watson to Gayle, 1 leg bye appeal for leg-before, but this is short of a length, not swinging, and hitting middle and leg, so it has to be pitched outside leg Doherty to Gayle, SIX runs this was on the cards, but to the first ball he aces from regulation left-arm spin? Doherty stays round the stumps to cut the angle, but he still lands it in Gayle's swinging zone, and Gayle sends it rows behind deep midwicket Cummins to Samuels, OUT Timbahhh. Slower ball at 116ks, and the middle stump lays flat. Samuels plays the odd ungainly slog this time, and is comprehensively deceived by the slower one Starc to Gayle, 5 wide you can't swing it from there. Full, well down leg, five wides Watson to Bravo, SIX runs and Bravo starts hitting sixes now. Length ball, middle and leg, and he moves forward to loft this over long-on: six sixes and three fours off the bat so far Hogg to Bravo, SIX runs wrong'un but too short, and Bravo goes right back into the crease to smack this for a flat six. Not too wide of deep midwicket, but you only have to miss them by a few feet if you hit so powerfully Watson to Pollard, 2 byes slower bouncer, Pollard sways out of it, Wade gets it on a half-volley, and lets two byes through. Gets the look from Watson Doherty to Pollard, SIX runs Gayle is dancing already. First 200 of the tournament. Full, middle and leg, smoked straight for yet another six. Gayle can't wait for after the match Doherty to Pollard, OUT oh finally a mis-hit finds a fielder. Pollard is looking for a fourth straight six, but this time he slices it high, high, high, and Warner takes a safe catch at long-off. Warner will have to do much more with the bat if we are going to have a match tonight Badree to Warner, OUT back and it skips past the cut stroke and narrowly avoids off stump, Ramdin had the bails off and they're going the check for the stumping, surely Warner didn't leave his ground here...oh it's not for the stumping it's bowled him! Who would have thought that, it nicked the off stump on the way through to Samuels to Hussey, 1 wide fired wide of off stump, left alone Samuels to Hussey, OUT oh swept straight up in the air and taken by the bowler in typically nonplussed fashion. Kicks the ball away, is that how one celebrates getting rid of Hussey in a semi-final? It is if you're Marlon Samuels. It was just outside off and Hussey swung hard at it aiming over the leg side but got it off a hug Badree to Watson, OUT goes for the shame stroke, again it skips on but this is straight and out goes leg stump. Right call to keep Badree going because he's slid one past the big man. That is a massive, massive blow. It was dragged down but skidded on to Watson and he was too late with the stroke Rampaul to White, OUT full and sliding now leg, Ramdin takes it and goes up for a huge appeal and up goes the finger! Rampaul strikes first ball with a strangle down the leg side, complete luck that is, White went to flick it to leg and must have got a thin touch on it, Ramdin was convinced and so was the umpire Rampaul to Hussey, OUT short ball into the body, the batsman gets into a total tangle and chips a catch back to the bowler. A disgusting dismissal. Got into a complete mess trying to defend it back to the bowler or turn it to leg, in the end, stood squared up and turned the face, it looped off a leading edge providing a simple Russell to Bailey, SIX runs another lovely strike from the skipper...where has this boy been...smashed a full ball just outside off over long off, lovely timing Sammy to Bailey, SIX runs swung over midwicket, another big strike from Bailey, taken off a length and gets it just over the fielder right on the rope, again cleared the front leg and swung hard Pollard to Bailey, OUT another step to leg and goes for the leg side fence taking on the deep fielder but this time picks him out. That's a very brave effort from Bailey but this time he doesn't quite time it and the man on the rope doesn't have to move to take the catch Badree to Warner, OUT back and it skips past the cut stroke and narrowly avoids off stump, Ramdin had the bails off and they're going the check for the stumping, surely Warner didn't leave his ground here...oh it's not for the stumping it's bowled him!

Gone again, clear the front leg and wallop it into the stands, timed superbly again, three out of four timed to perfection this over Sammy to Bailey, SIX runs swung over midwicket, another big strike from Bailey, taken off a length and gets it just over the fielder right on the rope, again cleared the front leg and swung hard Pollard to Bailey, OUT another step to leg and goes for the leg side fence taking on the deep fielder but this time picks him out. That's a very brave effort from Bailey but this time he doesn't quite time it and the man on the rope doesn't have to move to take the catch Pollard to Cummins, OUT first ball, steps away, goes to slap it miles but gets it straight up in the air and it's taken at extra cover. Can't blame Cummins for trying but didn't get this at all after giving himself room, straight up of a big top edge and extra cover took it simply on the edge of the circle So now we know, 12 teams whittled down to two and it will be Sri Lanka v West Indies in the final on Sunday, 7pm IST, once again in Colombo. And shortly beforehand the Women's final takes place between England and Australia, 2.30pm start for that one. We'll be here as per usual bringing you all the best coverage, reaction and analys Player of the match is Chris Gayle, WI","West Indies 205 for 4 (Gayle 75*, Pollard 38) beat Australia 131 (Bailey 63, Rampaul 3-16) by 74 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Chris Gayle anchored the West Indies innings ICC/Getty So lopsided was West Indies' obliteration of Australia in the second semi-final of the World Twenty20, the victors had near enough to 13 overs to bask in their looming progress to the final against Sri Lanka. Matthew Wade's departure in the eighth over of Australia's reply to 205 for 4 left George Bailey's team at a forlorn 43 for 6, their campaign collapsing in a few fevered minutes. Bailey was left to offer his team's last gesture of defiance, a breathless 63 from 29 balls, but it served only to narrow the margin. That they were chasing such a tall tally was down to Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard. Gayle was starved of the strike early and later battled an apparent muscle strain, but in between produced an innings of controlled aggression that helped foster a trio of partnerships with Pollard, Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo."
"Toss: George Bailey has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. They are playing an unchanged team. Hafeez said he too would have bowled first. He says a target of 150 plus on this pitch will be tough to chase. Starc to Hafeez, OUT you should have seen the swing! Starc comes over the wicket and gets it to swing back in sharply from the off stump line, Hafeez tried to flick it away but didn't read the movement, the umpire took his time, landed on off and replays showed that crashing into middle and leg Cummins to Imran Nazir, 1 wide hits the deck too hard and Nazir ducks under the bouncer, the bowler is penalised Watson to Imran Nazir, OUT Watson gets away with another full toss! Hardly a wicket-taking delivery but everything's going his way, Nazir meets it outside the leg stump and the ball hit the bottom half of the bat and spooned tamely to mid-off, easiest of catches, Nazir wouldn't want to see a replay of that, Nazir should have hit it straighter Doherty to Jamshed, 1 wide fired that really wide outside off and jamshed pulled out of the shot Doherty to Jamshed, OUT holed out to long-on! Tossed up and he stayed at the crease and tried to loft him downtown, the ball dipped and landed safely in Warner's palms in front of the rope Starc to Kamran, OUT Pakistan have lost their well set pair in a matter of three balls! Starc begins his new spell by bowling full from round the wicket, Kamran made room and tried to hammer it wide of extra cover but the fielder there, White, took a sharp catch falling to his right Cummins to Abdul Razzaq, OUT short ball outside off and Razzaq made himself a lot of room to carve that over the off side, he was targeting the third man boundary but the ball swirled just behind backward point, Watson takes the catch behind the circle Starc to Afridi, OUT that's as much as it gets with Afridi these days, Starc swung it in sharply from round the wicket, Afridi shuffled a long way across and exposed his stumps and his leg stump went back a couple of yards Starc to Hafeez, OUT you should have seen the swing! Starc comes over the wicket and gets it to swing back in sharply from the off stump line, Hafeez tried to flick it away but didn't read the movement, the umpire took his time, landed on off and replays showed that crashing into middle and leg Watson to Imran Nazir, OUT Watson gets away with another full toss!

Tossed up on the off stump and he gets on his knee and slogs with the turn and comfortably clears deep midwicket Watson to Jamshed, 1 leg bye goes for the slog and the ball clips his pad and rolls to the off side Hogg to Kamran, SIX runs sails away! Tossed up outside off and Akmal was on his knee and slogged cleanly over wide long-on, covered quite some distance Doherty to Jamshed, 1 wide fired that really wide outside off and jamshed pulled out of the shot Doherty to Jamshed, OUT holed out to long-on! Tossed up and he stayed at the crease and tried to loft him downtown, the ball dipped and landed safely in Warner's palms in front of the rope Cummins to Abdul Razzaq, SIX runs finally makes some solid contact, pitched up outside off and he makes room, gets under the bounce and lofts crisply over long-off Watson to Abdul Razzaq, 1 wide full and wide outside off and Razzaq sizes up to hit it but withdraws the shot Cummins to Abdul Razzaq, OUT short ball outside off and Razzaq made himself a lot of room to carve that over the off side, he was targeting the third man boundary but the ball swirled just behind backward point, Watson takes the catch behind the circle Starc to Afridi, OUT that's as much as it gets with Afridi these days, Starc swung it in sharply from round the wicket, Afridi shuffled a long way across and exposed his stumps and his leg stump went back a couple of yards Starc to Umar Akmal, 1 leg bye another inswinging yorker on the leg stump and he swings and the ball only hits his pads and rolls away If Pakistan can sneak in a few early wickets and expose the middle order, we will have a cracker. Join us shortly. Not a bad score but Pakistan would have been comfortable with so much more in this crucial game. The early wickets dented their plans and as a result at the end of ten overs they progressed at ODI pace, 5.5 an over and thereabouts. Jamshed provided the acceleration and Kamran Akmal gave him good support but Pakistan needed some big overs towards the end ideally. Ajmal to Hussey, 1 wide down the leg side and he tries to paddle it away and Akmal collects it and appeals confidently Raza Hasan to Hussey, 1 bye Hussey tries the reverse sweep and he doesn't make contact as well, hits Akmal's pads and rolls to the off side Ajmal to Hussey, 1 wide down the leg side and he tries to paddle it away and Akmal collects it and appeals confidently Pakistan will now be glued to the TV for the second match. India will need to win comprehensively to keep their hopes alive. Not over yet. Player of the match is Raza Hasan, PAK","The one that swung First ball of his spell, Mitchell Starc ran in and hurled it in full. Mohammad Hafeez knew it would swing in, and shaped up to work it to leg. But he hadn't accounted for it changing direction so much. The ball curled in past his bat and caught him plumb in front. The Watson moment Batsmen are finding new ways to fall to that man Shane Watson."
"Johnson to Elgar, OUT Mitchell Johnson has deserved this wicket, if not a couple more today, he's had Elgar expecting the short ball, sent in a few pitched up deliveries, and now he digs it into the body, it doesn't rise too much, Elgar pulls awkwardly, Wade settles under the tame top-edge Lyon to Philander, OUT Michael Hussey takes a skier that took ages to come down, Lyon tossing it up from round the stumps, Philander going after it, hitting it straight up, Hussey was under it at deep mid on as it eventually swirled down Johnson to Steyn, OUT Johnson strikes, Steyn wanted to leave that back of a length delivery, but was late on the decision, the ball takes the inside edge and crashes into the stumps even as Steyn was raising his bat Lyon to Morkel, OUT oh Morne, he sees a bit of flight on off, and swats it straight to mid on, third for Lyon Faf du Plessis goes back on a Test average of 266, and the last four SA wickets have tripled the score from 75 to 225. There was some help for the bowlers early on, but it is still not a wicket where you get bowled out for 225 on day one of a Test. Right, 14 overs remain for the day, Warner and Cowan are out to face the new ball, which is with Steyn. There are three slips Steyn to Cowan, OUT there is the outside edge and Dale Steyn has needed three balls to strike, Cowan stretching right forward to defend, it is a big stretch, the angle was taking the length delivery away from him, much like what happened to Smith, old man Kallis gobbles up the low catch at second slip Philander to Watson, OUT huge, long appeal for lbw, Philander kept appealing and almost reached the other end, umpire Rauf does not move, Smith goes for a review, length ball, Watson forward to block, it moves in to beat the bat and strike pad below knee roll, no doubt about that, it is hitting middle Steyn to Warner, OUT Appeal for a caught behind and he's been given out but Warner wants to review this! It was a loose drive outside off, slightly wide, Warner couldn't resist, de Villiers and the rest went up, Warner hesitated for a while and then reviewed after consulting Lyon, there was a noise, t Philander to Ponting, OUT Appeal for an LBW and he's been given! But Ponting's reviewing it. And Ponting loses out on the review because the third umpire is convinced that was hitting. Here's how it happened - Ponting was well across his stumps to defend, the ball swung in and hit him just below the t Steyn to Clarke, OUT Steyn's got the Big Fish with a peach! Clarke was all squared up there, good length on middle and off and moving away slightly, it was fired in at good pace and Ckarke had no time to get across and cover the line, just got the outside edge and taken by de Villiers, Australia 6 for Morkel to Hussey, OUT the constant probing over the last two and a half overs have paid off for Morkel! Morkel had complete control over Hussey over that period and really set this up, this was pitched up a bit more from round the wicket, on the channel outside off, Hussey had to play at it and got a Peterson to Wade, SIX runs and in no time at all Wade's got a fifty! What a way to get there, tossed up from round the wicket, on middle and leg and chips down the launches it over deep midwicket Steyn to Hastings, 1 leg bye on the pads and he clips it off his pads to fine leg Peterson to Johnson, OUT another left-hander is bowled off the slog! Is this an epidemic or what? Peterson's lapping it up, tossed up on middle and it didn't turn, held its line and hit the middle stump, Johnson holds the pose on his knees, head bowed, Australia nine down Peterson to Hastings, OUT wow! Super catch at the boundary to round off the innings!

South Africa embossed their No. 1 ranking with a fearful hiding of Australia in the series-deciding third Test in Perth, and not even the torrent of goodwill sent Ricky Ponting's way on his final day as an international cricketer could prevent resounding confirmation that the hosts remain a long way short of genuine aspirations to be the best team in the world."
"5.30pm Australia win toss and ... bowl Starc to Buttler, 1 wide wide length ball to start, outside off, left alone and it's called wide Cummins to Bairstow, OUT gone! Extra bounce, and the interesting field works! Jumped towards the shoulder of Bairstow's bat as he tried to defend this short-of-a-length ball. Great line, offering no room at all, and the edge pops up to that man at the gully-ish short third man position Agar to Buttler, OUT gone. Agar ends Buttler's fluent knock. Shortish, outside off, telling Buttler he's free to take the single to the fielder or fetch the pull from outside off stump. Takes on the pull, and hits it straight down deep midwicket's throat Maxwell to Morgan, OUT down the track, and that's a terrific catch from Smith! Floats it in towards middle and leg, and another batsman has lost his shape in the effort to hit inside-out. First it was Banton, now it's Morgan. May have stopped on the pitch a little, or maybe he just didn't get to the pitch of it. Ends up slicing high, back over the bowler's head more or less, Maxwell to Ali, OUT another for Maxwell! Again that little bit of in-drift, plus a misjudgment of length. Goes for the reverse-sweep off one that's probably a little short for it. And the drift ensures it pitches closer to leg-stump than Moeen expected. Ends up top-edging and offering a dolly to short third man Kane Richardson to Tom Curran, OUT short, wide, another slower ball, I think, and Curran waits and slaps it hard but can't control it because it gets up higher than he estimates, and he ends up hitting it straight to deep cover point Zampa to Malan, 5 wide Malan's been trying to make room to hit through the off side all through this over, and now he goes the other way, stepping across and exposing leg stump. Zampa looks to hit leg stump with a quick legbreak, but he gets his line wrong and beats everyone down the leg side as Malan misses the sweep Zampa to Malan, SIX runs bang. Not the worst ball, quickish length ball on leg stump, and Malan opens up at the hips as he stretches forward for the slog-sweep, and he hits it hard and square and all the way over the square leg boundary Zampa to Malan, SIX runs shot! Malan makes a bit of room again, and ends up having all the room in the world to free his arms as Zampa delivers a googly spinning away from off stump. Hits cleanly over the wide long-off boundary 7.41pm The lights are just taking effect. There will be a definite temptation to crank up Wood and Archer, and unleash hell for a couple of overs before Australia have gauged the wicket. But Moeen has opened in recent times to mix it up. We'll find out soon enough 7.45pm The players are out in the middle. Jofra Archer has the new ball, Warner is in his sights. Buckle up! Rashid to Maxwell, OUT flogged to short cover, and Rashid strikes with his last ball! That's a bad shot from Maxwell, no need to take on the dangerman at this stage. Making room and nailing a bottom-handed drive to Morgan. Suddenly Rash's figures look rather tidy, and well, England have the hint of the beginnings of a glimmer of optimism ... Wood to Agar, 1 leg bye round the wicket again, offering the left-handed Agar no width as he thumps the thigh pad with good lift from a tight line 9.50pm So, that's your lot for tonight. It's been a contest to live up to all its billing. Just a shame there was no crowd to lap it up, but we've been royally and remotely entertained. From Miller, Karthik, Chandan and the team, see you on Sunday for the rematch! Player of the match is Dawid Malan, ENG","England 162 for 7 (Malan 66, Buttler 44, Richardson 2-13) beat Australia 160 for 6 (Warner 58, Finch 46, Rashid 2-29) beat by two runs Australia imploded in their first international game since March at the Ageas Bowl, falling two runs short against England despite having needed 39 from the final 36 balls with nine wickets remaining in their chase. David Warner and Aaron Finch had put on 98 for the first wicket in the space of 11 overs to break the back of the chase, before Steven Smith flew out of the blocks at No. 3. But four wickets in the space of 14 legal deliveries gave England a foothold, as Australia went 5.4 overs without a boundary."
"Kleinveldt to Hussey, 1 wide too short too high too wide Steyn to Hussey, OUT and against all odds, Steyn has bowled Hussey and that will be stumps on the first day. Steyn pitched on a good length around off and the ball came back into the left-hander. Hussey was late in bringing his bat down and the ball hit the top of off stump. That will be small consolation for South Africa, they have received a severe hiding Steyn to Clarke, 1 leg bye length ball on the pads, Clarke was looking to whip that towards midwicket but misses, the ball rolls off the pads to the leg side Morkel to Clarke, OUT it's over! stop the press, Michael Clarke has been dismissed, yes he has, that was pitched up by Morkel, Clarke stays in the crease as he looks to play that one, he misses and the ball cannons into middle stump, that ball angled in, more than Clarke expected, between bat and pad, end of a classic from Clarke, end of a nightmare for South Africa Kleinveldt to Siddle, OUT Kleindveldt gets his first Test wicket, or does he? the no-ball check, that is tight, many replays needed to check whether it is behind the line, looks to be safe by mere millimetres, he is, Kleinveldt can finally savour a Test wicket, Siddle gets a healthy nick through to slip, that was a back of a length ball, Siddle might have been better off playing off the front foot, he hangs back in the crease, so Australia Morkel to Hilfenhaus, OUT and Morkel completes his five-for, the short ball does the job, this was headed for the helmet, Hilfenhaus goes for the hook, top-edges it towards deep backward square leg, a duck for the Hilf, Australia 504 for 9, not quite going to plan for them today Tahir to Pattinson, SIX runs Pattinson launches that over long-on for six, he has raced along to 39 now, in the slot from Tahir and that is bludgeoned beyond the boundary Steyn to Pattinson, OUT the innings is over, Smith takes his fourth catch of the innings, takes it on the second chance after missing it on the first, Pattinson gets a thick edge as he looks to thump a fuller one from Steyn, so Australia all out for 550 Stories from the prolific pair of Dan Brettig and Firdose Moonda expected from Adelaide shortly. you could occupy yourself before those arrive by checking out the Mumbai Test or the Khulna Test. For a better wrap of the day's proceedings check out Brydon Coverdale's report. Been quite a fightback from South Africa, but Australia are still the team in the stronger position. It started in the morning where Morne Morkel and Co took out the six remaining Australian wickets early on to keep the home side to550, when 650 was on the cards. Then their captain, Graeme Smith, led the way with a century on a track which still has almost nothing in it for the quicks. Clearly, South Africa's day but it would have been an even be Siddle to Smith, OUT Huge wicket, Smith's called for a review, pitched on a good length outside off and Smith tried to close the face on that one and drive it in the region of midwicket, there was a deviation, but the bat appeared to hit the ground just as the ball went past the bat. Bowden's given him out caught-behind. Did it move away just as the bat came down? Hot Spot shows a tiny heat signature on the outside edge, a very tiny one bu Clarke to Kallis, OUT Appeal for a caught-behind and it's been reviewed by Australia as the on-field umpire turns it down. Kallis went for a sweep, that was on leg stump and tried to sweep it fine. It definitely hit the pads but was there some impact with the bat as it lobbed up on its way to Wade? Gone. Struck the pads, then definitely struck the glove as it popped up to Wade. Hit the right thumb. Excellent hand by Du Plessis on debut, but Australia are in a strong position here, having gained a lead of 162. They have around 30-odd overs today and a good part of tomorrow to stretch that and put South Africa under pressure in the fourth innings. They were in a position to close out this innings for much lesser than 388, but that stand between Du Plessis and the injured Kallis was critical. Time for tea, and we'll be back with the Australian Innings Start Siddle has a short leg in place now","South Africa 388 and 8 for 248 (du Plessis 110*, Siddle 4-65, Lyon 3-49) drew with Australia 550 and 8 for 267 dec Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Faf du Plessis became the fourth South African to score a century on Test debut Getty Images Faf du Plessis would not have been playing in this Test were it not for JP Duminy hurting his Achilles tendon at the Gabba. And just as Duminy did on debut in Perth four years ago, du Plessis has grabbed his first chance at Test cricket to provide a remarkable result for the South Africans. At the WACA it was a near-record chase of 414 for victory; this time South Africa's challenge was to bat for four and a half sessions on a wearing Adelaide Oval pitch to salvage a draw. Thanks to du Plessis, they did so. Thanks to du Plessis, the scoreline remains at 0-0 heading into the decider in Perth, despite Australia having had the best of the first two Tests."

At last Australia have tasted victory this summer. It took until the fourth Test of their home campaign, and into the final hour at that, but Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle delivered a 137-run win for Clarke and their team-mates as Sri Lanka's tail-enders narrowly failed to hold on for a draw at Bellerive Oval. Despite the best efforts of Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan Samaraweera in particular, Sri Lanka will walk out on Boxing Day at the MCG 1-0 down. As the gloom began to close in, Australia entered the final hour needing two more wickets; Sri Lanka's victory target of 393 had become irrelevant during the morning."
"12.50pm Michael Clarke has won the toss and Australia will bat. Shahzad to Haddin, 1 leg bye swinging on to the pads now and Haddin gets a leg bye Shahzad to Haddin, 1 wide oh dear, well down leg again and this one goes through to Prior and is called a wide Shahzad to Haddin, 1 wide another bad ball swinging down leg from Shahzad, and Prior can't quite take it cleanly Woakes to Watson, OUT Woakes strikes! Watson goes for a hard cut behind point but he's picked out Collingwood, whose reflexes have not dulled at all! He takes a really good, sharp catch and Watson is on his way Finn to Haddin, 1 leg bye swinging on to the pads of Haddin, who gets a leg bye Finn to Haddin, OUT well, Brad Haddin's walking around in the crease has cost him now, and he's been bowled through his legs! Finn gets his first ODI wicket as Haddin tries to move across to the off side and clip through leg, but he's missed it completely and the ba Anderson to Marsh, 1 wide swings this one too far down leg and that's a wide PD Collingwood to Marsh, OUT And he's struck right away! He angled a gentle delivery into Marsh at 117 kph, it pitched on a good length and Marsh came forward to flick. He hit it cleanly but in the air towards midwicket where Strauss dived forward and to hi left to Woakes to White, OUT he's gone! And that is some delivery. Woakes pitched on a good length after angling the ball into the right-hander and got it to straighten off the pitch. White was squared up in his crease and his attempt at defending resulted in a sizeable edg Finn to Hussey, 1 wide ah, Finn gets this bouncer wrong as it sails down leg side and is called a wide Woakes to Hussey, OUT and Woakes' fine day continues! Hussey has dragged it on, trying to cut hard outside off and the ball cannons in to the off stump. The ball was there to be hit, he just didn't get it off the middle, and perhaps a touch of seam in to the batsman Anderson to Johnson, OUT Anderson strikes! Good bowling as he aims at the stumps - leg stump to be specific - and Johnson goes for the big hoick through the leg side and he's bowled Anderson to Smith, 1 bye that's an interesting one from Smith! He's tried the reverse hook to Anderson! Didn't get anything on it, but Prior has fumbled and they pick up a bye Woakes to Hastings, OUT Woakes gets five wickets! Hastings has lifted a slower ball over midwicket but straight to Collingwood in the deep, where he takes a pretty simple catch Woakes to Lee, OUT Woakes has six! And the 50th over may not be required after all. Lee has cut hard but in the air and third man takes the catch, it's the substitute fielder Luke Wright down there It was a funny sort of innings, Watson and Haddin looked like setting a good platform, as did Hussey and Clarke later on. But batsmen kept getting out after making starts. It should be a very interesting chase. Join us for the England innings in half an hour. Lee to Strauss, 1 wide pacy start, but wildly inaccurate from Lee. Hurled well wide of off stump, and one of those slips was almost in action to stop that - before Haddin moved across Lee to Prior, OUT bowled 'im! Lee has comprehensively won this battle, firing one at the top of off. Prior's feet went nowhere, the ball bursts past his attempted nurdle to gully and makes a mess of the stumps. Lee celebrates with a hop and a kick, and that's the fir Bollinger to Strauss, OUT two wickets in two balls! Both openers depart, England are in a hole now. Short, Strauss was quickly onto the pull but the ball didn't come off the middle of the bat, flying straight to Smith at square leg for an easy catch Lee to Trott, OUT gone first ball! Lee strikes again! It wasn't the best ball, a touch short and angling down the leg side. Trott flicked off his hip but in the air, and Bollinger tumbles forward at short fine leg to take the catch. England are in disarray. Brett Lee Hastings to Pietersen, 1 wide Pietersen charges down the wicket but Hastings spots him coming and responds with a canny slower-ball bouncer ... that's a bit too short though, and it's called wide Hastings to Pietersen, OUT Pietersen is gone! Oh, John Hastings has done it with the slower bouncer! It has absolutely stopped in mid-air on the way to Pietersen, who wants to pull hard but is playing too quickly and ends up swinging one-handed and gets a top edge t Johnson to Shahzad, 1 wide not the greatest follow-up, much too wide outside off stump Bollinger to Anderson, (no ball) ooh, that's nasty. That's slipped out as a very high full toss - a beamer really - at about sternum height. The ball evades Haddin too So, some consolation for Australia after the Ashes with a one-day series win secured with two games to spare. It was a team effort from them with both bat and ball today, Michael Clarke finding some semblance of form with his half-century. It looked like England would push Player of the match is Chris Woakes, ENG","Australia 249 (Clarke 54, Woakes 6-45) beat England 198 (Pietersen 40, Watson 3-25) by 51 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Chris Woakes took six wickets but it was in a losing cause Getty Images Australia secured the one-day series with two matches to spare after a comprehensive 51-run victory at the Gabba as England's batting once again flopped. The top order was rocked by the pace of Brett Lee, then John Hastings removed the key pair of Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell before the innings subsided rapidly to give Australia their first piece of silverware since March last year. The hosts' innings had been far from problem-free but Michael Clarke registered a much-needed half-century, which was his first since the Adelaide Test. He fell to the Man of the Match Chris Woakes, who took 6 for 45, England's best overseas analysis in one-day internationals, but he was a lone shining light. Although the visitors have twice nudged 300 in the series - at Melbourne and Adelaide - there has been far too much inconsistency and soft dismissals."
"Doherty to Prior, 1 wide Prior misses the sweep but that's because Doherty was down leg side Smith to Prior, OUT caught! Prior's cut one straight to point. The length was good and the line was outside off. Prior went back into his crease to cut, and found Doherty. That spun and bounced a touch and it hit the top edge Smith to Pietersen, OUT caught at long-on! The fielder was back on the boundary this time, but Pietersen went after Smith anyway. He came forward, got under the ball and hoisted it towards the boundary. Not enough distance on it though and Marsh ran in a few paces to take a simple catch Smith to Bell, OUT and he's been caught as well! Bell took two steps out of his crease to play the ball, Smith beat him in the flight and the ball pitched short of the batsman, Bell tried to readjust to dab the ball towards the off side but got a thick edge through to Haddin. Haddin almost wanted to complete the stump Hussey to Trott, OUT Hussey gets the breakthrough! Plenty of turn here for him, comes in a long way and cramped Trott as he tried to cut, took the bottom edge and cannoned onto middle stump. Excellent breakthrough to end a fine innings Hussey to Morgan, OUT Hussey gets his second! Morgan's reverse-sweep was timed well but straight to point, who jumped high to take the chance above his head. Wickets falling at ideal time and England are in danger of having the tail in for the Powerplay Lee to PD Collingwood, SIX runs heave ho! There we go! Collingwood has finally middled one and he's absolutely mullered it. Down the wicket and slugged into the stands over midwicket Bollinger to PD Collingwood, 1 wide Bollinger is struggling this over, and shoves this a long, long way outside off stump Hussey to PD Collingwood, OUT Collingwood tries to repeat the sweep/heave that got the boundary earlier, this time he timed it too well and it went straight to White who made no mistake this time. Ends an ugly innings but at least it showed signs of form Hussey to Shahzad, OUT Hussey gets another! What figures he has. Shahzad mistimes a full toss and it loops to midwicket who takes a very gentle chance So Australia will need 300 to win the match and seal the series. England started and finished well but again a mid-innings stumble cost them. It's a very good wicket and the outfield is swift so Australia should back themselves to do it. England, remember, only have three frontline bowlers. Peter English will have a bulletin About five minutes to go before the Australian openers come out and try to seal the series at the Adelaide Oval. If Australia get to 300, the last three games of this series will be dead rubbers. 300 is a long way away though. Anderson to Marsh, OUT caught and bowled! Anderson was testing Marsh with this angle into the left-hander from round the wicket. He was attacking the stumps constantly and not giving the batsman room. Marsh pushed a bit more at this one, the ball hit the bat a little low and went straight back to the bowler. Caught and Yardy to White, 1 bye aah, missed stumping, White charged down and Yardy fired it in much quicker and wide, beat White, and Prior spilled a certain stumping chance Tremlett to Smith, 1 wide strays down leg side, Tremlett will have to bowl that again Trott to White, OUT caught! And that might be it. White decided Trott had to go and muscled a length ball towards long-on. White had to create all the pace because Trott was giving him nothing to work with and he didn't hit it well enough. Yardy ran in from the boundary and held the catch. Anderson to Hastings, OUT well Strauss has caught Hastings now! Hastings had moved towards leg to make a bit of room, Anderson followed him with a shorter ball. Hastings was cramped but tried to pull it, the ball hit the top edge and lobbed up towards the leg side. Strauss took a dolly. Anderson to Smith, 1 leg bye full toss on leg stump, Smith should have hammered that but he failed to make proper contact Australia lead the series 3-1. Today's result has been great for the series. Three dead rubbers would have been too many in a series that already has one match too many. Peter English's bulletin has been updated. It definitely wasn't Australia's Day. Player of the match is Jonathan Trott, ENG","England 8 for 299 (Trott 102, Prior 67, Hussey 4-21) beat Australia 7 for 278 (Watson 64, Trott 2-31) by 21 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Jonathan Trott produced the day's defining performance with a fine 102, and he also chipped in with a couple of vital wickets Getty Images Jonathan Trott's calculating century ensured England stayed in the series with a 21-run victory that upset Australia's national holiday in Adelaide. The tourists began the game needing to win and the scenario won't change when they head to Brisbane for Sunday's fifth ODI, but they have been boosted by an end to four consecutive limited-overs losses. Trott's perfectly timed 102 off 126 balls stood tall on a day that was meant to be a celebration of all things Australia, but the home supporters left unhappy as the series score-line in the seven-game contest settled at 3-1. Trott, bowling his steady medium pace, even managed the valuable breakthroughs of Cameron White (44) and David Hussey (28) to end the pair's rescue act. England's 8 for 299, which was reduced slightly by effective slow bowling, was more than enough for Australia, especially when the dangerman Shane Watson fell for a bright 64."
"1.50pm Andrew Strauss has won the toss and England will bat. Lee to Prior, OUT Prior is gone in the first over! Ah, the Prior opening experiment is really not working for England. Lee has angled one back in and Prior is struck on the pad, low down, and given out. He asks for a review but that is plumb. He's gone! Watson to Bell, OUT gone! Good return catch from Watson! Bell tried to work it from outside off through the leg side, a-la Trott, but got a leading edge and Watson hurled himself to his left to take a very sharp catch Bollinger to Morgan, 1 leg bye Bollinger gets his line wrong, slipping this onto the pads but Morgan misses his leg-side whip and it bobbles off the pads Doherty to Morgan, 1 wide oops, this is thrown up far too wide outside off stump Hussey to Morgan, OUT oh no! Filthy long hop is nailed to midwicket where Clarke holds a fine catch. Morgan has fallen to some awful deliveries this series. Just as he was looking good he's smashed a pull shot straight to midwicket Doherty to Yardy, OUT Yardy's gone. Soft dismissal, simple dismissal. He edged down the wicket and chipped it gently back to Doherty Lee to Wright, 1 wide too far outside off stump for the batsman, and the umpire Hastings to Wright, OUT that's the end of Wright, he got a wider one and chased it with a big drive but gets a thin edge through to Haddin, Hastings gets the wicket he's been looking for Lee to Woakes, OUT there's Lee's second wicket, and Woakes again was trying to steer it to third man but this ball bounce more than he expected and nipped away a touch, he's got an edge through to Haddin Hastings to Shahzad, 1 leg bye wrong line now, down leg side and Shahzad gets it away fine, but not fine enough to beat Lee inside the circle Lee to Shahzad, OUT and Shahzad is gone, Lee gets his third! Shahzad was trying to go over the top and make use of the Powerplay, he's lifted it towards mid-off and White didn't have to move far to his left to make the catch Tremlett to Marsh, 1 wide touch of swing here into Marsh, who shuffled across his stumps and missed a leg-side work, it went pretty much over leg stump and was called wide. Harsh call Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide Shahzad from around the wicket digs in a short ball down the leg side. The umpire's don't like it, fair enough Tremlett to Haddin, 1 wide well Tremlett shoves the down the leg side. Trying to make sure Haddin has no room to free his arms but he's overcooked it Tremlett to Haddin, 1 wide Tremlett continues, probably for White, but this is shoved down the leg side PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 wide pushed well wide of off stump and Hussey leaves it, the umpire calls wide Yardy to Hussey, 1 leg bye angled down leg and Hussey gets a tickle of pad on that, past Prior PD Collingwood to Hussey, 1 leg bye down leg side now and Hussey gets a leg bye Shahzad to Hastings, 1 wide slower bouncer, outside of off stump. Shahzad is unimpressed with the umpire who calls wide, fair enough really because it wasn't far from off stump Shahzad to Hastings, 1 wide now thisis a wide, shoved down the leg side Woakes to Hastings, 1 leg bye Woakes strangles a shout as this thuds into the pads but it was heading down leg Australia win by four wickets Australia go 3-0 up, their fourth win in a row. After a wobble chasing England's modest total David Hussey with Steve Smith firstly and then John Hastings have steered them to a comfortable victory. Australia's bowlers, led by Brett Lee and backed up by Xavier Doherty, set up the victory. England didn't do much right today and now need to win an unlikely four games Australia won by 4 wickets (with 24 balls remaining) Player of the match is Brett Lee, AUS","Australia 6 for 215 (Hussey 68*, Haddin 54) beat England 214 (Trott 84*, Lee 3-27) by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brett Lee was Man of the Match for his 3 for 27 AFP Australia put themselves within touching distance of taking the one-day series with a four-wicket victory at the SCG. David Hussey guided them home in an uncertain run chase with an unbeaten 68 alongside Victoria team-mate John Hastings after Brad Haddin's aggressive 54 set the early pace. England were kept interested by early wickets and a double for Paul Collingwood but there were always too few runs on the board for a depleted bowling attack. It was an important innings for Hussey, who reached his fifty with a six, after he was named in the World Cup despite not playing ODI cricket for 18 months and he showed the finishing skills that have so often been evident for his domestic teams. He had important support from Steve Smith (26) after Australia wobbled on 5 for 114 then, after Smith departed to a horrid swipe, Hastings showed why he's off to the World Cup with a composed 18."
"1.50pm Andrew Strauss has won the toss and sent Australia in to bat. Shahzad to Haddin, OUT Shahzad gets another one! Again he nips the ball back in, and Haddin drives at it, gets a thin edge back in on to his stumps and the seam movement has now done for both openers Bresnan to Clarke, OUT ooooh dear! Clarke has not capitalised on his start. He's chased a wide one, which was there to be hit, but he's cut it straight to Bell who is just forward of point, what a disappointing end for the stand-in captain Tremlett to Hussey, OUT And another bites the dust! Tremlett probes outside off and gets one to seam away a touch, Hussey pushes off the back foot but straight to Strauss at gully, and he takes a good catch Tremlett to Marsh, 1 wide Tremlett goes too far on the tuck-him-up approach and slides this down the leg side Bresnan to Marsh, 1 leg bye Bresnan reverts to a fuller length, angling into the hips and Marsh shoves it into the leg side Yardy to White, 1 wide White lines up a reverse-sweep, Yardy responds by shoving it too far down the leg side Yardy to White, OUT Yardy strikes, soft dismissal that. Held back and tossed up from the bowler, White was a touch early on a drive but rather than go through with the shot he checked it, chipped it back wide of Yardy who dived smartly to his left to take the catch. England really needed that Shahzad to Smith, OUT another drag-on! Smith departs. Awful shot. Feet stuck in place and aiming a booming drive well wide of off, comes off the inside edge and cannons onto the stumps Yardy to Lee, OUT gone! Yardy strikes, and this one simply moves on with the arm, a bit quicker and Lee plays all around it, trying to guide it through the slips. The ball crashes into off stump, and Australia crash towards an extremely disappointing total. Shahzad to Marsh, 1 wide wide down leg side to start with, and Marsh lets it through to Prior Yardy to Marsh, SIX runs Marsh brings up his century with a six! Oh, what a moment for Marsh! He's launched a big slog sweep high, really high and for a moment it seemed it was going to fall short, but the man at deep wide midwicket backed back and tripped over the rope as that ball landed safely a couple of metres over the boundary Tremlett to Marsh, OUT ah, well, that's a rather unexpected end, as Marsh flicks high in the air to deep midwicket and the catch is taken Right, enough tattle. Strauss and Prior are out there, so are the Aussies. Brett Lee will start... Tait to Strauss, 1 wide banged in short. Very short. Too short for the umpire's liking. This is turning into a long over Tait to Trott, 1 leg bye extreme pace just seems to create drama. Even leg bye, thudding off the thigh into the leg side, seems thoroughly hectic Bollinger to Strauss, OUT Bollinger's good day just got much better! Strauss was again pinned on the crease and missed his attempted defence. Thudded into the pad and was given out. Strauss headed off but Trott has called a review! Height could be the issue.... but no, it is indeed hitting the top of leg stump Smith to Trott, OUT oh, Smith has struck second ball! And that was a pretty poor shot from Trott, who has pulled in the air straight to the catching man at short midwicket. He's picked the fielder out precisely. It may have been the topspinner, bounced a touch more than Trott expected. Hauritz to Morgan, 1 leg bye goes for the sweep now and lobs off the pad flap, Haddin sees it go over his head but loses the ball, and hopes he hasn't missed a chance - leg byes were called so he was fine Lee to Morgan, 1 leg bye on the pads and it just rolls out to the leg side, they scamper a leg bye and a sliding Lee can't pick up and throw in one movement Lee to Morgan, 1 wide wide of off and Morgan tries to cut, can't connect, and that has been called a wide by Paul Reiffel Bollinger to Yardy, 5 wide oops, Bollinger aims a yorker but it's way too full, and wide down leg and it slips away past a diving Haddin for five wides Watson to Bresnan, 1 leg bye flicks the pad and they get through for a leg bye Tait to Tredwell, 1 leg bye again they scamper through for a leg bye as he can't get it away off the bat Player of the match is Shaun Marsh, AUS","Australia 230 (Marsh 110, White 45, Tremlett 3-22, Shahzad 3-43) beat England 184 (Trott 32, Bell 32, Bollinger 4-28) by 46 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shaun Marsh made his second ODI hundred to set up a 46-run win for Australia AFP Shaun Marsh wasn't deemed good enough to be in Australia's World Cup squad, but in his first outing as Mike Hussey's injury replacement he cracked a brilliant hundred to lift his team from a hopeless position to 46-run victory at Hobart. Marsh's 110 rescued the hosts from two collapses, then England put together a poor run chase as Doug Bollinger completed a fine all-round match with four wickets. Australia's top order slumped to 4 for 33 and, following a 100-run stand between Marsh and Cameron White, they slipped to 8 for 142, before Marsh turned the game on its head. But his matchwinning effort wouldn't have been possible without Bollinger, who showed previously unknown batting prowess to hit 30 in an Australia record ninth-wicket stand of 88. Marsh was given a life on 61 when Ajmal Shahzad dropped a return chance and went from 84 to 101 in the space of one Michael Yardy over, the 45th of the innings, with two boundaries through midwicket followed by a six in the same direction to bring up his hundred from 101 balls."

We have So England finish on 294, perhaps they would have expected more after the start they got. The openers had plenty of lives but maintained a punishing rate; only KP made a big contribution after the openers departed though and England couldn't reach the 300 they seemed set to get. It was a wonderful innings from KP, controlled initially before bringing out the big hits against the spinners. The slow bowlers are expected to get some help in the second Tremlett to Haddin, 1 leg bye back of a length, the ball comes off Haddin's hip and they nip through for a leg bye Tremlett to Clarke, 1 leg bye loosener on leg stump to start, nudged to short fine leg for a scampered single, off the thigh Yardy to Watson, 1 leg bye off the foot and rolling to Trott at short fine leg Yardy to Watson, SIX runs huge! That is a really long boundary, and Watson has cleared it by some distance! It was a touch short and he just rocked back and clubbed it over midwicket Yardy to Watson, SIX runs another! And this one's even bigger! This time he's on the front foot and slog-sweeping, getting right under it and lofting the ball deep into the crowd. Australia's fans are awake now! Bresnan to Watson, 1 leg bye short to start, Watson attempts a paddle-pull but can't get it away, just the one Shahzad to Hussey, 1 wide yorker from Shahzad, but flung down the leg side. Hussey loses his footing and falls over Bresnan to Watson, 1 wide Bresnan aims for the yorker, but sprays it down the leg side and the umpire signals wide. The bowler isn't happy, he thinks that clipped the pad. Watto is limping though, suggesting he's hit his own ankle with the bat Australia win by six wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the one-day series, and Shane Watson has been their hero tonight. What an innings it was from him, one of the best one-day innings in recent memory. It was almost a chanceless knock, perfectly-paced and calm under pressure. There was always the feeling that if Australia could get someone to bat through the innings they'd finish on top. England were aggressive with the bat, but didn't use the last t Australia won by 6 wickets (with 5 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 4 for 297 (Watson 161*) beat England 294 (Pietersen 78, Strauss 63) by six wickets Scorecard Shane Watson played a stunning innings to secure Australia's victory Getty Images Shane Watson produced one of Australia's finest one-day hundreds to carry them to a record-breaking six-wicket win at the MCG with the highest successful chase on the ground. His unbeaten, career-best 161, Australia's fifth highest individual effort, allowed them to hunt down 295 with five balls to spare and take an early lead in the seven-match series. After a summer that has become synonymous with Watson's fifties this was a huge moment for the allrounder and both his hundred, and later the 150, were celebrated with arms aloft in front of an appreciative 34,000 fans. He kept his cool when the asking rate began to climb and fittingly was the man to finish it with a six over long-off. On a surface where scoring became hard work against spin and a soft ball this was a mammoth pursuit and for most of the time Australia had it under control."
"Woakes to Watson, SIX runs effortless, flowing strike. Full and straight, and Watson puts his full body weight through that lofted drive. Straight as you like, over the rope Woakes to Watson, OUT crucial breakthrough. Full length again from Woakes, a flick across the line from Watson, but Morgan at deep square leg is in place to take the catch Woakes to Warner, 1 wide down the leg-side Swann to Paine, OUT a swipe across the line, a massive steepler, Collingwood calls for it at short midwicket, steadies himself, fumbles the initial take, but clutches onto the rebound! Yardy to Warner, OUT tame end for Warner as he plays an unbalanced sliced loft down the ground, which Pietersen intercepts on the boundary's edge. Vital strike again from England, who are battling back now Swann to White, OUT cracking delivery, genuine spin as White, the Victorian, is nailed on the back foot. Paul Reiffel, the umpire - another Victorian - sticks up the finger! Yardy to Hussey, OUT short this time, but it's a rare bad ball that is too eagerly accepted by Hussey. A greedy slap to deep midwicket, where Woakes makes no mistake! Bresnan to Finch, 1 leg bye and another slower ball, another mow across the line, and a scrambled single as the shy comes in Shahzad to Smith, OUT another slower ball, a cutter this time, another smash, and short cover crouches to intercept. Bresnan to O'Keefe, OUT what on earth happened there? Ah, O'Keefe was bowled, that's what. An attempted Dilscoop, but he just ends up looking like a Dil, as his leg bail is removed by a length ball Johnson to Bell, 1 wide ooops, bad Mitch to start. Really bad. Slung six metres wide of off stump Johnson to Pietersen, OUT Cheers and boos ring loud as Pietersen falls! Johnson dished up a full drive-me ball that Pietersen climbed into, only to pick out White at cover who held an excellent low catch Hussey to Morgan, 1 leg bye quicker ball here and Morgan misses an attempted nurdle, bobbles past the keeper for a single Johnson to Morgan, OUT that's the match! Morgan has gone! Got a leg-stump half-volley and tried to heave it over deep midwicket, really struck it well but the MCG is a big ground and he couldn't clear the fielder Tait to Bresnan, 5 wide not smiling this time! After five perfect yorkers this is fired full and way, way down the leg side for five wides Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 7 for 147 (Finch 53*) beat England 6 for 143 (Bell 39, Johnson 3-29) by 4 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Aaron Finch's unbeaten 53 set up Australia's win Getty Images One swallow doesn't make a summer, but one Finch made Australia's day at the MCG, where the hosts ended England's eight-match winning streak in Twenty20 games. In his second game for his country, the hometown batsman Aaron Finch muscled a promising unbeaten half-century that pushed the total to 7 for 147, and the seamers held their nerve to give Cameron White his first victory as Australia's captain. In another tense finale after the final-ball thriller in Adelaide, England needed 13 off the last three deliveries, and Chris Woakes slammed Brett Lee over long-on for a crowd-silencing six that made the equation seven from two balls. But Woakes and Tim Bresnan couldn't repeat the dose against the pace of Lee, who bowled short at the end, and Australia's four-run win was confirmed with a pair of singles. England's chase had started well, as Ian Bell cut and drove a pair of sizzling boundaries through point off Shaun Tait's first over, and he and Steven Davies reached 0 for 60 in the eighth over."
"2.12 pm: Australia have won the toss and chosen to bat. Saini to Warner, 1 wide bouncer high over Warner's head and called wide Bumrah to Finch, 1 wide 140kph, bouncer, very high. Finch doesn't need to duck and it was a tough take for Rahul. Called wide Chahal to Warner, SIX runs slog sweep into the midwicket crowd! Wow. Leg break, tossed up in the slot, he got down on one knee and took no notice of the man at deep midwicket, he hit in 15 rows back! Saini to Smith, 1 wide 138kph, bouncer, bounces slowly wide of off and the square leg umpire calls wide on height. Might have been a bit stiff. It was tight Chahal to Smith, SIX runs launched straight to the sightscreen! He danced out and thumped this gun-barrel straight and it hit the sightscreen hard Hardik to Smith, OUT edged and caught at short third man! This was a wide slower ball, he fell over trying to cut it, got a thick edge and it flew straight to short third man on the circle. Smith is furious but he gets a hug ovation as he walks off Shami to Maxwell, SIX runs huge pull shot over square leg! 20 rows back! Short ball but chest high, he set himself early and with those fast hands thumped it way back Bumrah to Labuschagne, OUT caught at mid off! He picks out the man this time. It was a half volley in the slot, he tried to loft over mid off but nailed it flat and Agarwal takes the catch easily on the circle Saini to Maxwell, SIX runs high full toss swatted into the Members! Like a baseballer at the plate, he got a delivery knee high and flushed over deep midwicket again Henriques to Iyer, 1 wide 122kph, bouncer sails way over the head of Iyer and is called wide Henriques to Iyer, OUT brilliant catch by Smith at midwicket! Henriques gets a wicket on return. This was a short slower ball, it stopped in the pitch, Iyer had sit and wait, he whacked a pull shot hard to midwicket, Smith was alert diving full stretch on the circle to his right pulled in a beau Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT Super catch by Henriques at midwicket. Kohli got out in a similar manner in the first ODI and Hazlewood has provided a huge breakthrough. Back of a length, Kohli unleashes a pull while advancing, timed much better than he had in the first ODI, but Henriques at midwicket d Hazlewood to Hardik, SIX runs Pandya power. That's not such a bad ball but when he nails his shots, there's no stopping them. A touch too short and he swats it across the line - goes flat and hard, all the way over deep midwicket Starc to Rahul, SIX runs boom. Moves across to get inside the line to this short ball and pulls fiercely, sends it several rows back over deep square leg Cummins to Hardik, 1 wide full toss, this one is just beyond the line of control, so to speak, and it's a wide Zampa to Rahul, OUT and he's finally caught. Hazlewood at short third man has a very easy take. After being nearly caught for two balls in a row, Rahul goes off the third, a routine top edge lobbing up to the fielder. Was swiping across the line again but this was nicely flighted and dipped, got Cummins to Jadeja, 1 wide tried the wide yorker outside off but went too far across and it's a wide Starc to Hardik, (no ball) holes out to deep midwicket. He had to go for the big hits, but Australia have strangled him. This was dug into the pitch back of a length and he was cramped for room, tried to pull. Couldn't control it. oh wait a minute, it's a no ball. He's overstepped. Pandya stay Starc to Jadeja, SIX runs bang goes Jadeja. Another yorker attempt, this one was outside off and not as wide, but Jadeja clears his front leg and smashes it way over square leg. Powerful strikes these Zampa to Bumrah, OUT googly, he didn't read it at all and trapped right in front. He was shaping to push into the offside with the ball pitching on off, but it spun back in. He's standing fairly deep too, and struck below the knee roll so it's as plumb as it gets. Crashing into middle stump 10.46 pm Australia take the series with an unbeatable 2-0 lead. Two comprehensive wins, driven by their batting. Both times they put up totals that were just beyond what could be achieved. India's batting was solid enough but they had too much to chase. The bowling will cause some worries. Australia's Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 4 for 389 (Smith 104, Warner 83, Labuschagne 70, Maxwell 63*, Finch 60) beat India 9 for 338 (Kohli 89, Rahul 76, ) by 51 runs During the innings break the host broadcaster crossed for a segment with cricket's one of a kind YouTube curator Rob Moody, in what is set to be a regular feature as he takes viewers through highlights both brilliant and amusing. Moody's memory is near enough to photographic, but in years to come he will be forgiven for confusing elements of the second ODI between Australia and India at the SCG with the first fixture of the series two days before. On both occasions Steven Smith crashed a century from an identical number of balls, on both occasions Australia's batting functioned more or less as the captain Aaron Finch would want it to, and on both occasions India's chase faltered and then petered out after a modicum of a contest into the middle overs. 2:46 Moody: Hazlewood, Zampa difference between two attacks More worryingly for the Australians were parallel losses to injury, as David Warner followed Marcus Stoinis into the treatment room when he pulled up sharply with an apparent groin injury that has the potential to not just scupper his white ball duty but severely affect his Test summer as well. India's salient concerns were less to do with injury than quality of performance; twice now their bowling attack has been severely mauled, an experience shared only by Mitchell Starc on the Australian side."
"6.45pm Cameron White has started his captaincy on the right note by winning the toss and Australia will bat. Bresnan to Warner, 1 leg bye Bresnan finds a length around leg stump and it thuds off the pads around the corner for a jogged single Yardy to Watson, OUT Watson falls in the fifties again! Gives himself plenty of room very early and Yardy slings down a swift quicker ball that zips off the pitch and crashes into the top of off stump Yardy to Warner, OUT Warner couldn't quite clear the ropes this innings and he's picked out Shahzad on the midwicket boundary as he swung this to leg Yardy to White, no run this is neither six nor four as instead White shapes the perfect defence back to the bowler Woakes to White, OUT Woakes has his first international wicket! White departs trying to heave this over long-on, Pietersen jogs in, sets himself and holds an easy catch. Decent effort from Woakes removing a key scalp Bresnan to Hussey, OUT emphatic response from Bresnan. Perfect yorker rocks the middle pole. Hussey gives himself room, too much room and can't squeeze anything down in time Tait to Bell, 1 wide down the leg-side. Arguably the least eventful delivery of the innings so far. It's been breathless! Tait to Bell, SIX runs what a shot! Nice catch in the crowd too... short and wide, and violently uppercut, clean over the third man rope! O'Keefe to Pietersen, SIX runs zoinks, that's hit! Down on one knee, and belted into the stands at square leg Johnson to Morgan, 1 wide down the leg side O'Keefe to Morgan, 1 leg bye an attempted paddywhack, but that flicks the pad and deflects to short third man Anyhow, that's your lot for tonight. From Andrew Miller and Sahil Dutta, and Gnasher in Adelaide, it's goodnight, and see you on Friday. In the meantime, why not go and follow South Africa and India in Durban.

Woakes finished unbeaten on 19 from 15 balls as he struck the final ball over midwicket having lost Graeme Swann at the start of the last over with four needed. Ajmal Shahzad faced two dot balls before scrambling to the non-striker's end then Woakes scythed Shane Watson, who produced an outstanding all-round display with 59 and four wickets, through backward point to level the scores and ensure, at worst, England couldn't lose. They really shouldn't have pushed it so close having always been in control of the asking rate, but it's a credit to their belief that they could still pull through for victory despite a late clatter of wickets. Watson will feel the defeat particularly acutely having almost pulled the match back for Australia."
"Australia have done this a couple of times in India, in recent times. Once in Guwahati, and some years back in Baroda - winning the toss in a day game, bowling first and exploiting the conditions. NZ will need to approach this carefully. A smattering of a crowd has turned up for the game. Hopefully the stands will fill through the day. Tait to McCullum, 1 wide NZ are away with a wide from Tait who spears the first one well down the leg side Watson to Guptill, OUT oh well, Watto has castled Guppy with another grubber. Bad signs this, for the game. Back of a length from Watto, Guppy may have been better off coming forward in hindsight, but I doubt it would have helped. It just never came up off the track, Guppy played a half-cock forward block, but it kissed the toe of the bat and just shot through onto the stumps. Balls bounce more on nine-pin bowling alleys. Johnson to Ryder, 1 wide and it gets poorer. Wide well down the leg side. Watson to Taylor, 1 wide heavy ball from Watto, bangs it in miles short and he ducks under it. Was down the leg side too, and is called a wide Johnson to Ryder, OUT caught behind! New Zealand are making no progress here. Johnson hits a good length around off stump and gets the ball to straighten just enough off the pitch. Ryder pushes forward tentatively and gets a thick nick through to Haddin. It's what eventually happens when you let one bowler bowl at a batsman for long periods without making him change his line by rotating strike. Johnson to Franklin, OUT there you go, too high at No. 5. Franklin keeps his feet rooted in his crease and tries to drive at one extremely far away from his body. Rubbish shot, and the edge is taken oh so easily by Haddin. Tait to Styris, OUT horrific shot from Styris and the implosion continues. Tait pitched one short and wide, Styris went to slash it but it was a bit too far from him. He needed to get a bit closer to the ball but he didn't and the edge is once again taken by Haddin. Tait to Taylor, OUT bowled him! Tait fires a full and fast yorker at Taylor, who had no hope once he made the decision to play across the line. He played around the ball and it crashed into off stump. Krejza to McCullum, 1 bye the ball beats the bat and thuds into Haddin before rolling towards short third man Smith to How, OUT How reviews an lbw call that looked plumb at the outset. Tossed up on middle from a touch wide of the crease, grips and straightens as How looks to defend it in front of front pad. The bat came across from its backlift, that began with the bat pointing at gully, a little late. The ball thudded into the pad in front of middle and was headed towards the stumps too. A review wasted, How is gone. Johnson to McCullum, OUT Nathan reviews an lbw decision. Another interesting one, as Mitch landed on middleand leg. The ball was doing nothing, just carried on with the line. Nathan, for some reason, was looking to get across to the off stump and nurdle to the leg side. A fine plan that, but not if you miss the plan. He did. Hit in the front of middle, and it was carrying on to hit off. Both reviews done for New Zealand, and an important wicket for Aus. Johnson to Southee, OUT Ponting is saved a hefty fine for slow over rates as Australia manage to bowl New Zealand out, just five minutes over time. Poor, poor shot from Southee. Looks to launch a straight length ball without getting forward, and just tonks it up in the air. It goes up into the Nagpur sky and when it comes down, Ponting is ready, despite the fact that the midday sun would have blinded him. Southee to Haddin, 1 wide another wayward ball down leg side, poor control from Southee Bennett to Watson, 5 wide poor ball, too full and too far down leg side. McCullum's dive can't prevent the five wides this time Ryder to Watson, 5 wide Ryder's ruined a good over with a shocking ball down leg side. With McCullum standing up, he has no chance. Ryder to Watson, 1 wide full ball down leg side. McCullum collects as Watson misses the flick and whips off the bails in a flash. Watson had overbalanced but managed to keep his back foot grounded Bennett to Haddin, OUT Bennett gets Haddin with a 96.4 kph slow bouncer. Comical stuff all round. It came out much shorter than Bennett wanted - landed midway down the pitch, took off in slow motion and seemed to stop - in mid-air mind you - as Haddin evaluated his options. He decided to throw the horizontal bat at it and swat it down, but it was too high for him to control. He ended up looping it to deep midwicket, despite rolling the wrists over it, and this time Fra Bennett to Watson, 1 wide very wide outside off and Watto can't reach it though he wants to Bennett to Watson, OUT Bennett has picked two in two. Do NZ have a chance to get back into this? Once again, Watto perishes soon after crossing his 50. Bennett continues to operate with that nagging lack of pace, this time back of a length and well outside off. Watto waited for it to come on and played an ugly cross-batted swipe. The ball was coming slower than he expected, and took the inside edge before crashing into the stumps. Bennett to Clarke, 1 leg bye slips onto Pup's pads and he's eases behind square for one Vettori to Ponting, 1 wide this one is a grubber that slips down the leg side, Called a wide Southee to Clarke, 5 wide Southee does his bit for an early finish, pushes an inducker well down the leg side. Baz, standing up, had no chance. Southee to Ponting, 1 wide, OUT Ponting must be miffed. Hide the TV in the dressing room. Lovely work from Baz, he's stolen a wicket out of nowhere. Southee pushes another one half a foot down the leg side, Ponting is lulled out of the crease as he plays a walking flick and misses. McCullum doesn't. With hands quicker than a rattlesnake he collects and removes the bails. By the time Ponting turned back, McCullum was celebrating. Hide the TVs I say. Ryder to Clarke, 2 wide this one slips down the leg side and is a couple of wides. Clarke doesn't get his backfoot out, unlike Ponting. Right, Australia have walked away with the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Or so they say. I don't see any Cup being handed out. Anyway, that's the end of game 8.

"Utseya to Haddin, OUT Zimbabwe's first ever referral now. Utseya lands this back of a length outside off and it comes in gently with the angle, and then sharply with the spin. Haddin looks to work it through square leg, casually off the back foot, and is hit in front of middle. It was hitting middle a Cremer to Watson, 2 leg byes Cremer lands this outside the leg stump and he deflects it fine. Two extras Chigumbura to Ponting, 1 wide slips the first ball down the leg Cremer to Watson, OUT huge appeal for lbw, turned down. Will they refer it? Yes, they will. Tossed up on middle and off and fizzing along straight, off the track. Watto was well forward, but the replays suggest that was crashing into middle and off, three-fourths of the way up. No evidence that it hit Mpofu to Clarke, 1 wide short ball down leg side, he will have to re-bowl that. Mpofu to Clarke, 1 wide full ball down leg side. Mpofu needs to keep it together here. Mpofu to White, OUT bowled him! White needed to go for it, and he picked a slower ball to try and hit through midwicket. He was early on the shot and the ball cannoned into middle and leg stump off the bottom edge. Utseya to Clarke, 1 wide fired down leg side once again, another wide Price to Hussey, OUT and that's why! Bowled him! Hussey charges down the track and aims for the heave down the ground. Price drags it shorter, bowls it quicker and keeps it dead straight. Hussey misses by a long way, and Price hits the stumps. Mpofu to Smith, OUT Mpofu is very, very lucky. He bowled a rubbish ball, a full toss on leg stump. Smith could have smashed it, anywhere. Instead he sort of chipped it off his pads and straight to the fielder on the deep square leg boundary. Lee to Coventry, SIX runs that is one of the flattest sixes you'll see! Coventry laid into a length ball outside off and played the square drive with immense power. The ball rocketed off the bat and flew over the point boundary. It carried about ten feet over the boundary and smashed into the wall. Lee to Coventry, OUT this was a likely dismissal. Coventry was edgy against the short ball and tried to pull this one from outside off stump. The top edge swirled high in the air and the ball descended in the region of silly mid-off, where Lee was waiting to take the caught and bowled Lee to Taibu, 1 wide shorter ball and the line is slanting down leg side. Taibu misses the swivel-pull but that's wide Johnson to Taibu, OUT he's given Watson some catching practice at first slip. Taibu tried to guide the ball towards third man by opening the face but the line of the short of a length ball was far too close to the body. He ended up steering it off the face towards Watson's right. He bent swiftly to ta Tait to Taylor, OUT bowled him! Taylor tried to work the ball on the leg side from his crease and closed the face of the bat. He missed and Tait sped the ball through and grazed the pad before uprooting middle stump. Nothing special, just straight, fast and very effective. Johnson to Ervine, OUT Johnson bowls a full, fast and straight ball that thuds into Ervine's pads as he tries to play across the line and falls over a touch. Johnson roars an appeal but Asoka de Silva is unmoved, again. Haddin is adamant that it should be reviewed. Replays show that it's pretty plumb. Krejza to Chakabva, OUT Regis perishes to a strange shot, trying to pull a length ball tossed up around middle and leg. He may have played forward to it, he should have played with a straight bat. Instead, he stayed back and looked to pull. It gripped and straightened, whizzed past the bat and thudded Johnson to Price, 1 leg bye Price ducked straight into that short ball from Watson and got hit flush on the helmet. Why they allow leg byes for evasive action I don't know. Daft rule. Zimbabwe stayed in the game for quite a while with a tight bowling performance from their spinners. But their inability to take frequent wickets allowed Australia to post a strong total, which their fast bowlers were able to defend with ease. Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 262 for 6 (Watson 79, Clarke 58*, Mpofu 2-58) beat Zimbabwe 171 (Cremer 37, Johnson 4-19, Tait 2-34) by 91 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shaun Tait's pace was too much for Zimbabwe as Australia surged to a 91-run win at Motera Getty Images Australia began their World Cup campaign on a winning note, wrapping up an easy 91-run win over a Zimbabwean outfit that had no answer to the pace battery of Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson, who finished as the pick of the bowlers with 4 for 19. Zimbabwe had put in a spirited display in the field to keep Australia to 262 for 6 on a good batting wicket, but they never looked like chasing the runs down once a positive opening stand between Charles Coventry and Brendan Taylor had been broken. With Lee and Tait steaming in with the new ball, Zimbabwe's openers had every reason to be nervous but they quickly shed their early jitters - Coventry's flambuoyant flash over cover point being a particular highlight - and started to settle before Lee switched his length with immediate reward. Digging the ball in, he drew a false stroke from Coventry and an ungainly hook resulted in a top edge that Lee himself charged round to catch. Brendan Taylor did his best to overcome the setback but the revival was short-lived and after Tatenda Taibu glided Johnson straight to slip Tait beat Taylor for pace, aiming one full and straight and pin-balling it off bat and pad to disturb his stumps."
"10.50am Cameron White has won the toss in his first ODI as captain and Australia will bat. Anderson to Paine, 1 wide oops, this one goes down leg and doesn't swing back - it's called a wide Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide wrong line, well down leg side Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide another wide down leg side - both bowlers have battled to get the right line so far today Plunkett to Paine, OUT ah, now, we have a review that could be for both caught and lbw. Paine was walking down the pitch and tried to flick the ball to leg, it's hit him on the pad and lobbed out to cover, where the catch has been taken. So England want to know if it's either lbw or caught, which Paul Reiffel decides a Anderson to Ferguson, OUT Ferguson is gone! Good ball from Anderson as this one bounces sharply outside off and Ferguson fends, and it's well taken high and to the right of Strauss, the only slip in place. Ferguson probably didn't have to play at that bouncer - it wasn't aimed at the body. Plunkett to Haddin, 1 leg bye angling a touch down leg and Haddin can't get it away properly, just getting one wide of Davies Plunkett to Haddin, 1 wide a good short ball that bounces up around off stump is given a wide. It's because bowlers aren't allowed to be threatening in ODI cricket Wright to Haddin, 1 wide this is slipped down the leg side, and no amount of bright-eyed apology can stop this being a wide Wright to Haddin, 1 leg bye leg-sided again and it thudded off the pads and trickled into the leg side Yardy to White, 1 leg bye White is the sort of man that could stand tall and smash this out of Perth, instead he gets down apologetically on one-knee and misses a ramp-sweep. Awful that Yardy to Haddin, OUT smart work from Finn on the long-on boundary sees the end of Haddin! Poor shot really, he just lifted the ball without much intent towards Finn on the boundary, who back-pedalled to take the catch, felt himself about to go over the rope to through the ball up, stepped over before coming back and c Wright to White, 1 wide adverts interrupted this delivery, so I'm not entirely sure what happened. Send your complaints to the BCCI, who should prevent this from happening Yardy to White, OUT Yardy has another! White tortuous innings ends. White edged down the track but only to bunt this with plenty of inside-edge back to Yardy who gleefully held on to the chance Plunkett to Hussey, 1 wide Plunkett gets his line wrong, shoving this down the leg side Plunkett to Voges, 1 wide banged in short, but too short and it sails way over the batsman Wright to Voges, 1 wide this is shortish and shoved down the leg side Finn to Hussey, 1 wide wrong line and this is called a wide as Hussey doesn't get anything on an attempted glance Plunkett to Hussey, OUT Plunkett strikes! Hussey tries to turn this one to leg but it's bounced a touch more than he expected and lobbed off the shoulder of the bat towards point, where Bell takes a smart catch diving forward Anderson to Johnson, OUT Prior has taken a stunner in the deep! Oh, he can catch it without gloves after all! Johnson swung from the hips, trying to clear the boundary at midwicket, and Prior was about 10 metres inside, then backed back and leapt high to take the catch above his head - terrific catch. Finn to Hastings, 1 wide Hastings walks across towards leg and this one sails down the leg side - wide is called Finn to Voges, 1 wide once again Finn is tricked by the wandering of Voges, who backs off, then walks across outside leg and tries to hook a ball that Finn speared down leg. Wide called. Anderson to Hastings, OUT Hastings backed away without looking too sure of what he was doing, Anderson banged it in a touch shorter and a thickish top edge looped out to cover Very good recovery from Australia puts them in charge. England were impressive at times and tawdry at others. 19 wides tells you all you need to know, Australia have probably 19 too many. Andrew McGlashan will have a bulletin ready shortly and we'll be back in about 30mins. In the meantime check out our YouTube channel. Tait to Trott, 1 wide and this is slung too wide of off. Guess that will happen with him every now and then Tait to Davies, 1 wide Davies watches his first ball go down the leg side Bollinger to Trott, 1 leg bye Trott shuffles across his stumps and a short ball is flicked off the hip to fine leg Tait to Trott, 1 wide shoved down the leg side this time. Quick though Tait to Trott, 1 wide pace and width draws Trott into a flat-footed waft outside off which he misses Tait to Pietersen, 1 wide wide, wide, wide, wide. Short and outside off this time. Pietersen ended up hopping on one leg to aim a swish to off but couldn't reach it Hastings to Prior, 1 wide the slower bouncer now from Hastings, but it's also the wider bouncer - way outside off Hastings to Yardy, 1 leg bye struck on the pads on leg stump and half a shout for lbw from Hastings, but that must certainly have pitched outside leg Tait to Yardy, 1 wide nope, wide ball as Tait sprays this one down leg Bollinger to Yardy, SIX runs and all of a sudden Yardy has pulled Bollinger for six! What a good shot, he's connected well with this and cleared the rope comfortably, and that's Yardy's highest ODI score Tait to Anderson, 1 wide banged in at the hips, but a touch too leg-sidey and that's a wide Player of the match is Adam Voges, AUS","Australia 7 for 279 (Voges 80*, Hussey 60, Anderson 3-48) beat England 222 (Yardy 60, Johnson 3-18, Tait 3-48) by 57 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Adam Voges was the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 80 Getty Images Australia rounded off their international summer in style with a commanding 57-run victory in Perth. It wasn't a high-quality match, with the exception of the batting from Adam Voges and David Hussey, as a long season drew to a close with two patched-up sides on show. However, Australia's depth came to the fore again as Voges hit a career-best 80 before England's mentally-finished top order was blown away to end hopes of a face-saving win. Nothing will compensate for the crushing loss in the Ashes series, but Australia's resurgent one-day form has suggested a fourth consecutive World Cup title isn't out of reach, especially if key players return from injury. Even taking into account England's own injury problems and declining form, the home side's performances have boded well in the absence of Ricky Ponting, Mike Hussey and Nathan Hauritz - all key figures in the one-day side."
"Johnson to Strauss, 1 wide where did this come from? Johnson attempted a slower one, and it goes woefully wrong, bouncing three feet outside leg stump Smith to Strauss, OUT Strauss comes rushing down the track, and finds the man at short midwicket with his attempted lofted stroke, it was teasingly tossed up, Strauss took the bait, and hit it straight to David Hussey who throws the ball gleefully in the air after Lee to Pietersen, OUT and the Powerplay jinx continues! Lee pitched on a good length around off stump, Pietersen tried to go over mid-off, the bat turned in his hand as he mis-timed it and he couldn't clear the fielder at mid-off. Steven Smith took a simple catch a Hastings to Bell, 1 wide the slower ball but its line is haywire, wide outside off stump Tait to Trott, 1 wide full and wide outside off stump, Trott made room and then couldn't play a shot Tait to Bell, OUT caught, Bell makes room to hit a full ball through the off side but hits it flat and hard right at Clarke at extra cover Lee to Trott, 1 wide that's too wide outside off stump, England reach 300 Watson to Morgan, OUT caught at short third man. Morgan whipped around to get into position to play the reverse swat and make good contact with the length ball too. He hit it in the air, though, and straight to Tait in the circle Tait to Trott, OUT short ball and Trott falls after top edging a pull shot. He made room and skied it, Tait called for the catch and took it cleanly Woakes to Watson, 5 wide that's ugly, sprayed well down the leg side and Prior never had a chance Anderson to Haddin, OUT Trott is back on the field and back into action with a tremendous, diving catch at short fine leg! Leg stump half-volley from Anderson, begging to be put away and Haddin gets nicely into position to flick to fine leg. The ball goes in the air Yardy to Watson, OUT Yardy strikes! Great catch from Andrew Strauss. Another fifty-and-out for Watson, he was aiming to whip through the leg side but hit the ball in the air. Strauss, at short midwicket, leapt to his right to pluck the ball out of the air. A timely Yardy to Johnson, OUT oh dear, Ferguson and Johnson had done so well but they've really messed this up. Johnson tried to slog sweep, it lobbed off his pad out to the leg side and Ferguson toook off for a single that Mitch wasn't ready for, Ferguson turns back but h Finn to White, OUT he picks up a wicket first ball, the dangerous White departs! It was short and rising to about neck height, White swivelled into pull but couldn't control the shot and the ball lands in Eoin Morgan's hands out at deep square leg. He barely had to Pietersen to Clarke, 1 wide speared down the leg side this time, that's wide Finn to Clarke, 1 wide Finn attacks the body as Clarke shuffles to off, and he's called wide. Fair enough, good call Anderson to Clarke, SIX runs shot! Clarke can really hit them when he wants to. This was not a slog by any means, or if it was it was a graceful one. Anderson strayed onto the pads, Clarke got insde the line and just lifted it over square leg. The ball never got up Finn to Hussey, OUT got him! Finn strikes, after beating the outside edge a couple of times he sends down another slower cutter on a length and this time the ball kisses the edge of Hussey's flailing bat. Straight through to Prior, the celebrations are very muted i That's all from your commentary team today.

And while you are at it, you could also check out our Australia go 5-1 up in the series with a nailbiting two-wicket win with four balls to spare. After all the flak he's received, it was Michael Clarke who held Australia's chase together with a well-paced knock that ensured that the earlier efforts of Watson, Johnson and Fe Australia won by 2 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Jonathan Trott, ENG","Australia 8 for 334 (Clarke 82, Johnson 57) beat England 6 for 333 (Trott 137) by two wickets Scorecard Jonathan Trott's superb form continued with a career-best 137, but it wasn't enough to secure victory Associated Press The boos from Brisbane turned to cheers in Sydney as Michael Clarke helped Australia hunt down a record 334, their highest successful chase, by two wickets with four balls to spare at the SCG. However, it was a tense finish after Clarke was run out for 82 with seven needed but John Hastings and Brett Lee held their nerve to see the home side across the line and leave a weary England with plenty of soul-searching to do That will be particularly true of Jonathan Trott, who was involved in key pieces of action in the closing stages after earlier scoring a career-best 137 to anchor England's highest score in Australia and their highest total in a defeat. Then, in the space of five balls, he lost and almost won the match with two contrasting pieces of fielding. Firstly he failed to hold onto Clarke's clip at short fine-leg which burst through his hands for four, but he then produced a pin-point throw to find the Australian captain short as he came back for a second. It was the third wicket to fall quickly with Australia faltering as the target approached."
"9.6;W;Ashwin to Watson, OUT the man from Chennai has struck, Watson went for the slog sweep, this one was slower through the air, tossed up, and turned in to strike the off stump, even as Watson missed it completely, did not get too far across to pick it from outside off, played a bit early too;Shane Watson b Ashwin 25 (39m 38b 5x4 0x6) SR: 65.78; Harbhajan to Ponting, 1 wide flighted again, and turning, but from round the stumps, goes down leg Harbhajan to Ponting, 1 wide tossed up from round the stumps, turns down the leg side, Ponting went feeling for it, wanting to nudge it fine Yuvraj to Haddin, OUT Yuvraj's golden arm strikes again. Raina takes a smart low catch tumbling forward. Haddin was clearly looking to make things happen against Munaf and Yuvraj, and he may have chanced his arm once too often. Yuvraj slows this one up in the air, tosses it up on off and gets it to break away. Haddin looks to power the cover Khan to Hussey, OUT Zaheer does it again. It's again that mystery bare-knuckle slower ball. It's the latest invention from the Zaheer labs. Instead of getting fore-finger and middle-finger behind the seam, he gets the middle finger alone behind the ball and pushes it through with the knuckle of the fore-finger, which is to the right of the b Harbhajan to Ponting, 1 wide turns down the leg side, Ponting misses on the shot Ashwin to Ponting, OUT Ponting lines up for the reverse hit, a rarity, but ends up hitting it straight to Zaheer at short third man, end of a magnificent innings from the Australia captain, raises his bat as he walks back Harbhajan to Hussey, 5 wide sees him come down the track, fires it in on leg stump, but it ends up far wide down the leg side, Dhoni had no chance Sachin and Sehwag are out there. Motera is abuzz. Lee has the ball. Sehwag faces. 5 first-balls went for 4s. What about the sixth? Two slips. Tait to Tendulkar, 1 wide bad start. Tait wides down the leg side. Tait to Tendulkar, 1 wide 149 kph. The pace is up, but the direction is still a little awry. Very wide outside off and called. Tait to Sehwag, 1 wide Tait's direction is conspicuous by its absence. Another wide down the leg side. Watson to Sehwag, OUT Sehwag is gone. He hasn't looked his best through this innings. Watson has got him with a bouncer that wasn't very high on pace, but was spot on with its direction. It angled in from outside off, cramping Sehwag for room as it came in, but he still looked to pull. The top edge ballooned up and landed in Hussey's hands at Watson to Gambhir, 1 wide Watson sprays one well down the leg side and it is called a wide Tait to Tendulkar, 1 wide and right away slings this one down the leg side Tait to Tendulkar, OUT Sachin is gone, or is he, is that a back foot no-ball, it was a length ball outside off stump, and he nibbled it on its way to Haddin, it was very close to being a no-ball, but Tait got away with it, he hadn't grounded the back heel on the line, Sachin has to walk back Lee to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni has perished. He's not been in great form, and clearly that's affecting his thinking. After the last two balls, you'd have expected better than a wild airy cut to a short ball. That was again pacy from Lee, got it to bounce extra and Dhoni had no control on the cut. Seemed like he wanted to hit it right through Clarke Lee to Yuvraj, 1 wide Lee slips one too far wide outside off. Johnson to Yuvraj, 1 leg bye slanting into the pads, Yuvraj gets some pad on it as he looks to flick. Leg bye. India get closer. Johnson to Yuvraj, 1 wide the crowd is delirious. Mitch slants another wide down the leg side. Ponting looks gutted. India are taking this away. On behalf of Abhishek and the rest of the gang, this is Nitin Sundar signing off.

India won by 5 wickets (with 14 balls remaining) Player of the match is Yuvraj Singh, INDIA","India 261 for 5 (Yuvraj 57*, Tendulkar 53, Gambhir 50) beat Australia 260 (Ponting 104, Haddin 53, Ashwin 2-52, Yuvraj 2-44) by 5 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Rick Ponting's terrific century went in vain as Australia could not defend 260 Associated Press An awe-inspiring Ricky Ponting dazzled and Sachin Tendulkar hit a delightful fifty but it was the imperious Yuvraj Singh who stole the show to lead India to an exciting semi-final encounter against Pakistan. On a dry pitch, aiding turn, India couldn't remove a wonderfully solid Ponting, but found a way around him to hold Australia to a competitive 260. Tendulkar set the base and the middle order threatened to choke, but Yuvraj played a blinder to charge India to a famous win. Sometimes, they say, one four can change things around. That clich? came alive today, in the final ball of the 39th over, with India needing 72 from 67 deliveries, when Yuvraj spanked Shaun Tait for a stunning four over backward point."
"Wahab Riaz to Haddin, 1 wide that's a poor ball, Wahab is letting the noose slip now, with a wide down the leg side Hafeez to Ponting, OUT gone! Akmal has held a very good catch and Ponting has to go! Things really bubbling over here. Ponting went back to cut a ball which wasn't really there for it, got a thick edge that Akmal did well to hold. It was given not out originally, but rightly was overturned on review. While waiting for the third Wahab Riaz to Haddin, 1 wide nonsense down the leg side. Doesn't look like Wahab can land six deliveries consistently Wahab Riaz to Haddin, OUT Wahab strikes and Australia are in trouble now! Akmal takes another catch! I between the dross Wahab has found some bounce and nibble and Haddin aimed a nothing steer to third man, got a faint edge and Kamran held on to the chance. Hafeez to White, 1 leg bye unable to work singles White aims an almighty hack, can't connect but the ball springs off the pads for a single Abdul Razzaq to Clarke, OUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clarke didn't look happy at Razzaq's box of tricks, and an attempted pull somehow wriggles through the stroke to dislodge the off bail Abdur to Hussey, OUT that's as soft as a baby possum. Hussey hardly got to the pitch of that one, and lobbed a simple chance to short midwicket. The two-paced wicket might take some of the blame, but that was poor from such an experienced campaigner Umar Gul to Krejza, OUT there it is! The Umar Gul inswinging yorker strikes again. Why did he wait so long? Krejza backed away to give himself room to pierce the off side but he missed and the stumps were shattered instead Afridi to Lee, 1 wide speared a long way down the leg side Afridi to Smith, OUT Afridi strikes! Smith backs away to a googly that follows him and it crashes into middle stump Umar Gul to Lee, OUT that's it! Australia slump to 176 all out - their lowest since 1992. Pakistan have a celebratory huddle! Lee aimed a swipe but it got high on the bat and looped to mid-off Welcome back. It's been an historic day in Colombo. For the first time in 12 years, Australia have been bowled out in a World Cup game, and they face the very real prospect of defeat. It's been a two-paced track, however, and with a pace trio of Lee, Tait and Johnson, express pace and uneven bounce could yet turn the tables. Personall Tait to Hafeez, 1 wide that's the worst of Tait shortly after the best of him. An ugly bouncer, barely crosses the tramlines Lee to Hafeez, OUT there it is! The breakthrough looked imminent, and so it was. A rapid delivery, Hafeez closed the face too early as he attempted to work a straight ball through midwicket, but a looping leading edge tempts Lee into a full-on sprint out of his follow-through, and he clings on to an excellent stretching take! Tait to Younis, 1 wide fired down the leg side Johnson to Umar Akmal, 1 wide outside off, left alone Pakistan win by four wickets Umar can take a lot of credit for steering the chase home with an unbeaten 44. Shafiq set it up with a patient 46 but Brett Lee and Jason Krejza aside, Australia were impotent. Finally, after 34 games without defeat in the World Cup, Australia have been toppled. Intriguingly this sets up a likely clash bet Pakistan won by 4 wickets (with 54 balls remaining) Player of the match is Umar Akmal, PAK","Pakistan 178 for 6 (Shafiq 46, Umar 44*, Lee 4-28) beat Australia 176 (Haddin 42, Gul 3-30) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brett Lee was outstanding but needed better support from his team-mates AFP Pakistan were the last team to overcome Australia at a World Cup and it was they who brought Ricky Ponting's 34-match unbeaten run to an end with a four-wicket victory in Colombo to secure top spot in Group A. An impressive display in the field laid the foundations as the reigning champions were bundled out for 176 on a difficult surface, their lowest total in a World Cup since 1992, and despite a mighty effort from Brett Lee Pakistan were guided home by Umar Akmal and Abdul Razzaq. Despite not having either team's progression at stake, the final group positions determine quarter-final opposition while momentum is also a factor. Both teams were hyped for the contest, and it came to an early head when Umar and Brad Haddin almost came to blows in the field. Australia were desperate not to relinquish a proud record dating back to May 23, 1999."
"Chahal to Warner, 1 wide leg break, 84kph dragged down the leg side and it's called wide Jadeja to Finch, 1 wide goes down legside so he'll have to rebowl that Chahal to Warner, 2 wide flatter on leg stump, tries to go down and slog sweep, but misses it. Goes down leg so it's a wide and they take a single too Bumrah to Warner, (no ball) and Bumrah lets Warner know that he's not here just to make up numbers. Excellent bouncer, outside off, Warner sways out of the way Shami to Warner, OUT huge appeal for a catch by the keeper and not given. Kohli has gone for the review. Yorker length ball, shaping away a touch, his bat hit ground as the ball went past and Rahul had an easy take. And there is a spike as the ball goes past the outside edge with the bat not yet Bumrah to Finch, OUT An attempted ramp goes wrong! He lobs a catch to Rahul. It was a bouncer that just sat up above his head, he tried to ramp it over Rahul but he just lobbed it up off the face of the bat to Rahul Chahal to Stoinis, OUT caught behind! A top-spinner outside off, Stoinis goes back and tried to punch off the back foot, gets an edge and Rahul takes an excellent catch Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide 119kph, slower ball bouncer but it bounces very high and is called wide Chahal to Maxwell, SIX runs Tipped over the rope by Hardik Pandya at wide long off! Tossed up outside off, Maxwell launched this hard and flat to wide long off, Hardik was in off the rope, he had to back pedal a touch, he jumped up with one hand but just tipped it up and over for six Saini to Maxwell, SIX runs launched into the Ladies Stand! Full and straight but not a yorker, he cleared the front leg, sitting deep, he scooped it with the bottom hand and hit it way back over midwicket! Shami to Maxwell, OUT caught at long on! Straight down Jadeja's throat and he doesn't let it go! Full outside off, he swatted this hard and flat but didn't get the elevation, Jadeja was in off the rope but he didn't have to move Saini to Labuschagne, OUT holed out to long off! Slower ball does the trick, 116kph, Labuschagne lofted it high but into the wind to long off, Dhawan comes around and takes it easily 10m in from the rope Shami to Smith, OUT bowled him! A low full toss, on off stump, Smith backed away and tried to open the face to slice it behind point but he got a little nick and it crashed into off stump. He was furious he missed out there but a fabulous innings nonetheless Starc to S Dhawan, 1 wide length ball, strays down leg. That'll be a wide Starc to Agarwal, 1 wide angling across him now, ends up well wide of off stump and it's another wide Starc to Agarwal, 1 wide still not getting his radar right, goes back the other way, outside the right-hander's off, but it's too wide outside off Cummins to Agarwal, 1 wide bouncer goes wrong, banged in short but well down legside. Another extra Hazlewood to Agarwal, OUT caught at point. The bowler out-thinks the batsman in that one. Agarwal stepped away again, looking to thrash this over cover, but Hazlewood banged it in short this time and followed the batsman. Agarwal ended up not in the best position and his slash went off the top edg Cummins to Kohli, 1 wide just outside the tramline so it's a wide, but he beat Kohli that time. Kohli was moving slightly across again, and reached out for it with his hands, it went past his outside edge Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT caught at midwicket Superb bowling and field placement. Kohli was advancing down the track again, Hazlewood kept it back of a length, and bowled into Kohli, who could only get it off the high part of his bat as he tried to pull. The ball plops to Finch, and the Australians Hazlewood to Iyer, OUT snorter does him in. Iyer will not want to watch a replay of that. Hazlewood dug this in short and rising sharply towards his head. An ungainly attempt to get out of the way by Iyer, but his bat was hanging in the air like a periscope above his head. The ball balloons off it Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 wide length ball sliding down legside and that'll be a wide Cummins to S Dhawan, 1 wide tries to bowl a bouncer on the free hit but it's down legside and a wide. So it's still a free hit Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 6 for 374 (Finch 114, Smith 105, Warner 69, Maxwell 45, Shami 3-59) beat India 8 for 308 (Pandya 90, Dhawan 74, Zampa 4-54, Hazlewood 3-55) by 66 runs Australia's first match of a Covid-19 international summer that might have begun in Perth, Brisbane or Adelaide before finally settling upon the grand old SCG was fitting in that it was both bracingly uneven and also a commanding victory for a home side that was as organised as the logistical efforts that had allowed the series to get underway in the first place. A backbone century from Aaron Finch and a blistering one from Steven Smith, coupled with characteristic contributions from David Warner and Glenn Maxwell, vaulted Australia to an imposing 6 for 374, before India's chase was unable to maintain the runaway momentum of a beginning that benefitted from a rare case of Mitchell Starc losing control of the ball. The hosts were concerned primarily by a side problem that afflicted Marcus Stoinis - in a tight schedule his injury may open a path for Moises Henriques or Cameron Green. Aaron Finch and Steven Smith put up a strong partnership Getty Images For a couple of passages in particular: the 25 balls in which Maxwell accompanied Smith and then the 21 faced by Virat Kohli, the game touched moments of the greatest possible theatre. But these interludes were fleeting, and fell either side of a more dominant theme, that of Australia's ODI team imposing their greater sense of settled system and home comfort against an Indian side that will be battling both foreign conditions and increasing extremes of isolation after decamping to the IPL as distantly as three months ago."

Looks like Watson will face. Two slips in place. Osinde warms up for a bowl. Balaji Rao to Watson, 1 leg bye sprays this down the leg side, Watto gets a single as he looks to flick. It goes fine off the pad. Davison to Haddin, SIX runs majestic from Haddin. Jumps out to the flight of Davison's offie and tees off down the ground for another six. They are just flying in all directions now. Baidwan to Watson, OUT Watson has missed his 100 too. This immense compulsion to hit sixes has finally cost him his wicket. He wanted to pull this. It wasn't straight enough. He still wanted to pull this. It wasn't short enough. He still wanted to pull this. Ends up trying to whack it over long on, but finds the man in the deep. Osinde to Ponting, OUT a bad day for Ponting comes to a forgettable end. Hide the TVs, is the joke doing the rounds. His bowlers struggled to bowl out Canada. Steve Smith nearly muffed a catch that was his. And now he's not got the batting practice he wanted. And he's again perished to the short ball. Late on the pull, pops it up to square leg meekly.

Though the margin of victory - seven wickets with 91 balls to spare - was huge, they did not have it easy throughout. Canada ambushed them with the bat, and then created some chances with the new ball. Australia's pace and power eventually swamped them but Ashish Bagai's team exceeded expectations in their final World Cup appearance. When Bagai chose to bat, the probability of an early finish in Bangalore increased significantly, but Australia's inevitable supremacy was delayed by an extraordinary attack from 19-year-old Hiral Patel, who batted fearlessly to score a rapid half-century off the world's fastest bowlers."

Haddin moves forward, picks up the ball from outside off and swings it high and straight to the man on the deep midwicket boundary C Obuya to Ponting, OUT loud appeal for lbw as Ponting attempts to work the ball on the leg side but misses and gets hit on the pad. The umpire says not out and Kenya want a review. That one didn't turn, was going straight through. A terrific review it is for that was hitting mi Kamande to White, OUT oh wow! Did Kamande become Murali? White is shocked and with good reason. That ball pitched a long way outside off and spun viciously into the right-hander. White pushed forward in defence and the ball spun past his bat and hit off and middle. More middle t Odoyo to Clarke, 1 bye Odoyo beats Clarke's drive off the front foot and the ball beats the keeper as well, deflecting off his glove towards third man Odoyo to Hussey, 1 wide very wide down leg side ... NN Odhiambo to Clarke, 2 wide wide down leg side, too far for Clarke to get bat on the ball NN Odhiambo to Hussey, OUT caught at long-on! The length was a touch full, the line was outside off and the pace might have been a touch slower. Hussey drags the ball from outside off towards David Obuya who ran in a bit and took the catch. Hussey was aiming to hit it straighter Odoyo to Smith, 1 leg bye strays down leg side, Smith tries to nudge it but gets hit on the pad Otieno to Clarke, SIX runs another full toss, and this time Clarke does it, pulling the ball and timing it well enough to cause a flutter in the people beyond the midwicket boundary Otieno to Smith, 1 leg bye Smith gets cramped for room with this line from round the wicket and mis-times the pull behind square NN Odhiambo to Clarke, OUT whoops, he's holed out to long-on. Clarke tried to launch a full ball over the man on the long-on boundary. He didn't get enough elevation or distance and Patel took a fine catch at shin height. That was travelling to him quickly and Clarke's World Cup Tait to Obanda, 1 wide Tait pitches short of a length but strays down leg side once again Lee to Ouma, OUT edged ... and taken! Lee follows the bouncer with a full ball that begins to swing away from the batsman from around off stump. Ouma chases after it with the drive and edges to Haddin who takes a simple catch. Excellent ball after that bouncer. Full and swinging Tait to Obanda, 1 wide a full and fast ball down leg side again. Tait's radar is wonky today. Tait to Obuya, 1 wide the bouncer and David Obuya ducks under it Johnson to C Obuya, 1 wide ah now that's the widest wide of the World Cup. Haddin has to dive a long way to his right to collect it Tait to Mishra, 5 wide that is a horrendous ball. Awful, terrible and call it anything else too. Tait sprays it so wide outside leg that it would have missed a second set of stumps Lee to C Obuya, 1 leg bye nudged off the hips towards fine leg Watson to C Obuya, SIX runs this time the pull is connected with and it travels well over deep square leg...that's too short at Watson's pace Tait to C Obuya, (no ball) that was close to bowling him after the batsman missed the swing but that wouldn't have been out anyway because Tait over-stepped Tait to Odoyo, 1 bye bowled, middle stump, but it doesn't count of course off a free hit, Odoyo backed away to swing and missed Player of the match is Collins Obuya, KENYA","Australia 324 for 6 (Clarke 93, Hussey 54) beat Kenya 264 for 6 (C Obuya 98*, Mishra 72) by 60 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Michael Hussey was quickly up and running on his return from injury Getty Images Australia's World Cup campaign resumed with an ultimately comfortable 60-run victory against Kenya, although Collins Obuya's unbeaten 98 meant the Associate nation took pride out of the contest. An upset was never on the cards but Kenya put in their best performance of the tournament with the highlight being the 115-run stand between Obuya and Tanmay Mishra. The imposing run chase had been set up by a 114-run partnership between Michael Clarke and the returning Michael Hussey in his first innings of the World Cup. It actually gave Australia some important breathing space, but Kenya had long-since given up any hope of chasing down 325 on the ground where Ireland shocked England earlier in the tournament. The most tension came in the closing overs, when Obuya could have reached his maiden one-day century - and Kenya's first at a World Cup - but he failed to get the three runs he needed off the last two balls."
"Shakib to Watson, SIX runs Absolutely thumped! Six on the off side. They kept bowling there at him and this time Watson got close to the ball and whacked it over long-off. Flat-batted thump Razzak to Ponting, 1 wide wide down the leg side, Ponting fails to connect with the sweep Razzak to Watson, OUT Watson is out. Will the entertainment end? The crowd roar in delight. It was a nice delivery, much slower through the air and Watson is beaten by the lack of pace. he went for the big slog sweep and missed it completely. The ball landed, winked at him and gently pegged back the off stump. Razzak to Ponting, OUT Ponting is not happy but he has to go. It was the full delivery on the middle and Ponting went for the sweep and missed it completely. that looked pretty close unless of course the ball was turning away sharply. Mahmudullah to Clarke, 1 wide slips in a wide down the leg side Mortaza to Clarke, OUT Clatter! Mortaza has knocked out the off stump. The Batting Powerplay strikes. It was the full delivery, just short of the blockhole, on the off stump line, Clarke shuffled across and went for the big across-the-line swing. Mistake. No wood on leather but the opposite. Mortaza to Ferguson, OUT Another one goes down in the batting Powerplay and wicket no 150 for Mortaza Congrats sir. It was the full delivery and it was hit straight to mid-off. Fergy has combusted. Mahmudullah to Hussey, 1 wide slips a wide down the leg side Mortaza to Johnson, OUT Holes out to deep midwicket. Mitch show is over. It was a length delivery on the middle and Mitchell Johnson slogged it straight to deep midwicket. Razzak to Paine, OUT loud cry for lbw and the ump has raised the finger. He went for a reverse sweep but missed. Shafiul to Hussey, OUT Looked pretty plumb. Full, straight, and on the middle. Hussey went for the paddle sweep but missed. Super-cool knock this. His third ton. Hastings to Imrul, 1 wide wide outside off stump and Keyes tries to reach it Pattinson to Imrul, OUT Imrul Kayes has fallen after a brave fine knock. Siddons looks shocked. It was a full delivery angling away from Kayes who goes for the off drive. He reaches out, away from his body and get a thin edge. The debutant James Pattinson gets his moment under the sun. Pattinson to Mahmudullah, 1 wide bouncer down the leg side. Wide Johnson to Nafees, OUT Nafees is done by the slower one. A lovely change of pace and Nafees picked it up very late. He lunged out in the end and ended up stabbing it straight up in the air. Watson came in and took it around short-leg position. Australia tighten the screws. Johnson to Shuvo, 5 wide Paine goes diving to his right to stop the wide but can't get there in time. Wayward delivery Johnson to Shuvo, 1 wide A wide down the off side this time.

Player of the match is Michael Hussey, AUS","Australia 361 for 8 (Hussey 108, Watson 72, Razzak 3-58, Mortaza 3-80) beat Bangladesh 295 for 6 (Kayes 93, Mahmudullah 68*, Nafees 60, Johnson 3-67) by 66 runs Scorecard and ball by-ball details Michael Hussey made 108, his first ODI century in four years Associated Press Michael Clarke will fly out of Bangladesh with a clean-sweep to his name in his first series as Australia's full-time captain, but it didn't come without a few jitters in the final match. Michael Hussey's century and another Shane Watson blitz set Australia on the path to their fourth-highest ODI total of all time, and while the final margin of 66 runs may appear comfortable, Bangladesh put up a feisty chase. The hosts needed 362 for victory, which even their most ardent fans must have felt was unachievable after they managed only 210 and 229 in the first two matches. But Imrul Kayes and his top-order colleagues gave the Mirpur crowd something to cheer about, pushing the score to 179 for 1 with 20 overs remaining, and Clarke was scratching his head for an answer. It came in the form of the debutant fast bowler James Pattinson, who picked up his first wicket for his country - not the same country his brother Darren represented - when Kayes edged behind for 93, and the required run-rate crept into unrealistic territory."
"Lee to Imrul, 4 byes that's beaten both batsman and wicketkeeper. Lee sprays it wide outside off, Kayes' eyes light up at the width on offer and he goes after it with a mighty swing, the ball swings away and beats the bat, it swings away from Haddin and beats him Johnson to Tamim, OUT stunningly caught at first slip! The ball was pretty ordinary, on a length wide outside off, Tamim went after it, driving with power. He didn't make proper contact though and the thick outside edge flew at furious pace towards the left of Wats Johnson to Imrul, OUT and his misery is over and this sets Bangladesh back. It was a short ball and Kayes attempted the first pull of the day. He tried to hit it from way way outside off though. It didn't come off and the top-edge flew high in the air towards the Hastings to Raqibul, OUT bowled him. Bangladesh continue to sink. Hastings hits the pitch short of a length and seams the ball away from the right-hander after pitching around off and middle. Raqibul tries to defend but plays down the wrong line. The ball clips th Smith to Shakib, OUT bowled him! Smith flights the ball across the left-hander, drawing Shakib into the front-foot drive, the ball pitches and spins back into the batsman, finding the gap between bat and pad to hit the stumps Johnson to Shuvo, OUT caught at cover! Shuvo backs away to a length delivery and tries to slap it over the infield, he doesn't get enough elevation and Smith takes the catch above his head Lee to Mushfiqur, SIX runs it's been a long time coming! Length ball from Lee, Mushfiqur clears his front foot out of the way and slams it over deep midwicket, Mirpur roars as the ball sails into the stands Shafiul to Watson, 1 wide starts with a wide ball outside off stump, was just inside the tram line I think but the umpire is harsher than I am Shakib to Watson, SIX runs Watson uses his long reach to lunge forward and heave the ball over deep midwicket, immense power, Australia are racing away and Haddin hasn't faced a ball! Shakib to Haddin, OUT caught at midwicket. It's Robin, though, not Batman. Haddin charges and tries to hit over the leg side, he gets beaten in the flight and makes contact with the inner part of the bat. The bat turned on impact as well. The ball flies in the air Razzak to Watson, SIX runs well he's got it this time, short ball and that is simply too easy for Watson who once again shows off his pulling skills by heaving a long hop into the first tier at midwicket Mahmudullah to Watson, SIX runs Gulp. Watson sees a short ball, and pulls again, giving it plenty of air time as it makes the journey from pitch to stand beyond wide long-on Razzak to Watson, SIX runs and he's broken it. His 13th six. Again heaved over wide long-on. He takes the record for most sixes in an innings from Xavier Marshall. Bangladesh want this over with now Rubel to Watson, SIX runs well he's got his 15th!! This time with a cool swing through the line, lofting the ball straight over the fielder on the long-on boundary Australia won by 9 wickets (with 144 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 232 for 1 (Watson 185*, Ponting 37*) beat Bangladesh 229 for 7 (Mushfiqur 81*, Johnson 3-54) by nine wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson's rapid century helped seal a comfortable series win for Australia Associated Press Shane Watson knocked Bangladesh's bowlers senseless with a world record tally of sixes as the Australians galloped to a nine-wicket victory in the second limited overs match in Mirpur to seal the series. The target of 230 had appeared a possible banana skin on a slow pitch offering some turn, but Watson made such light work of it, that his unbeaten185 from 96 balls now stands as the highest ODI score by an Australian, overtaking Matthew Hayden's 181 against New Zealand in 2007. Xavier Marshall's 2008 mark for most sixes fell when Watson swung his 13th over the rope, the second six in as many balls off the bowling of Abdur Razzak. Watson added two more for good measure, and in all scored 79.74% of the total runs scored by Australia; Viv Richards, in his momentous 189 not out against England in 1984, had scored 69."
"Razzak to Watson, OUT Razzak goes up in a fervent and long-drawn appeal, ultimately gets the decision in his favour, Watson was pushing forward, playing for the turn, there hasn't been much of it today, this one went straight on, struck him on the pad, in line wit Shuvo to White, OUT Imrul puts White out of his misery, he came charging down the track, did not get to the pitch of the ball, and went through with the shot half-heartedly, just managing to chip it in the air, he grimaced right away knowing he was in trouble, Imr Shakib to Clarke, 1 wide darted in wide down the leg side, no turn at all Shuvo to Hussey, OUT Hussey finds long off with precision, got too close to the pitch of the delivery as he skipped down the track, long off had positioned himself nicely under the ball as it came down safely in his hands, big wicket Shuvo to Smith, OUT heave-ho, and clatter, Smith goes for the big one over midwicket, misses the ball that does not turn, and off stump is rattled, Mushfiqur likes it Mortaza to Clarke, OUT now he is gone, got underneath the fuller one and swung it high in the air, long on settled underneath it, and took it tumbling down in the end Johnson to Nafees, OUT Mitch gets one now, Nafees had that front foot planted a long way across the stumps, by the times he tried to get the bat around to the full delivery, the ball had already crashed in to pad, Mitch surprisingly went up in an half-hearted appea Johnson to Tamim, 1 wide another one down the leg side. Classic Mitch, this over. Even he can't predict where the next ball will go. Hastings to Raqibul, 5 wide sprayed full and wide dpown the leg side, Haddin misses the take, Lee gives chase at fine leg and almost pulls it back but it trickles on to the ropes Hastings to Raqibul, OUT Watto, what a man, goes diving to his left at short extra cover as Raqibul drives in the air away from his body, and comes down on terra firma with the ball safely lodged in his hands, Raqibul's painful stay is cut short by a blinder, wond Lee to Shakib, 1 wide called a wide down leg, the Australians think that took something on its way to Haddin Hastings to Shakib, 1 leg bye tucked away off the pads, yet another single to fine leg, helps in whittling down the margin, drip by drip Smith to Mushfiqur, SIX runs tossed up and he takes it on, comes down the track and lofts it with the turn to the extra cover boundary Smith to Mahmudullah, SIX runs swatted over mid on, it was tossed up and he helped himself to an almighty heave So Michael Clarke has a comprehensive win in his first win as official Australia captain. Bangladesh never attempted to go for the target after losing a couple of early wickets, and just went through the motions of playing out the 50 overs. That will be all from us for this game. You can catch all the action from the IPL here. This is Abhishek Purohit signing off along with Gopi Rangarajan. Cheers. Player of the match is Michael Clarke, AUS","Australia 270 for 7 (Clarke 101, Shuvo 3-44) beat Bangladesh 210 for 5 (Tamim 62, Shakib 51) by 60 runs Scorecard and ball by-ball details Michael Clarke led from the front with 101 Associated Press Michael Clarke passed his first test as Australia's full-time captain, leading from the front with a century before his bowlers backed up the effort to complete a 60-run win over Bangladesh. Australia have a 1-0 lead in the three-match series and while the results might seem inconsequential after the World Cup, the subplot of Clarke taking over the leadership from Ricky Ponting has created some interest. Clarke's 101 suggested that the responsibility could sit well with him, and he needed to anchor the innings after Australia lost three wickets in their first 14 overs having been sent in on a good batting pitch. He helped get the Australians to a strong total of 270 for 7 and Bangladesh, who only twice in their ODI history have successfully chased totals of that size, were not up to the task. They stumbled to 9 for 2 in the fourth over of their pursuit and although Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan both made half-centuries, the result was all but certain by the halfway point of their chase."
"Welegedara to Khawaja, OUT Reverse swing! Timber! Khawaja's tentative stay ends. He has always shown the bowlers a tempting gap between bat and pad, and this time Welegedara sneaks through it. This is just short of a yorker length, Khawaja drives away from the body, and the late swing squeezes in to hit the stumps Randiv to Hussey, SIX runs another top shot from Hussey. Charges at Randiv, goes inside out over mid-off for the second six of the series. He was so close to the pitch of the ball the turn couldn't have bothered him Randiv to Haddin, OUT Sharp offbreak, sharp catch! This is quick, turning in sharply, Haddin turns it around the corner... around the corner is Mathews at backward short leg who takes a smart low catch in front of him Lakmal to Johnson, OUT soft soft dismissal after many much more menacing deliveries! This is short and wide, going wider, but Johnson goes for the pull as opposed to the cut, and gets a faint bottom edge through to PJ. It was so innocuous the slips didn't even realise he had edged it! Lakmal to Harris, OUT Finally they get an lbw out of Kettleborough. This takes a long internal deliberation, though. This is short outside off, Harris doesn't offer a shot, the ball seams back in sharply, and hits him just under the knee roll, just outside off. Because he was not playing a shot, the point of impact was irrelevant. To me, it looked like it would have the the top of off. Kettleborough takes his time before Randiv to Copeland, OUT Sharp turn, simple bat-pad catch. This is flighted, draws Copeland forward, who looks to play this to leg, is not close to the pitch of the ball, gets an inside edge onto the pad, and an easy catch accrues for short leg Dilshan to Hussey, OUT Given leg-before! Again it's the straighter ball from an offspinner that has done the damage here. This pitched outside off, Hussey defended, playing for the spin, the ball went on with the arm, hit the pad, right in front of off. Kettleborough took his time, then raised the finger. Hussey reviewed it just in case. Replays say there is no just in case here Nevertheless a superb innings from Hussey. The Sri Lankans congratulte him as he walks off. Michael Clarke applauds from the balcony. Despite Hussey's superb 95, though, Sri Lanka will be pleased to have restricted Australia to 273 after losing the toss. They will have one over to bat today. Generally, though, they wouldn't want to bat last on this wicket.

No fight at all from Sri Lanka, they were always under pressure after Dilshan's needless bravado early on. Australia doing everything right, seamers not giving anything away in terms of width or driving length, spinner coming in superbly on a helpful pitch, and allrounder proving his value with deadly reverse swing.

His determined and at times handsome innings also served to cloud Australia's spin bowling plans for the first Test at Galle, as neither Michael Beer nor Nathan Lyon were able to pose too great a threat on a pitch that offered sizeable rough and some sharp turn. The Australians had been bowled out for 393, the captain Michael Clarke retiring after a suave 104, before the Board XI sailed smoothly to 174 for 2 by the time the teams agreed to an early close at about 4pm local time. Trent Copeland, with 1 for 14, and Ryan Harris again looked the tourists' most likely bowlers, though Lyon (1 for 51) was able to claim the wicket of Thilan Samaraweera. Beer was the more economical of the pair, leaving the selectors a choice between promise and parsimony."

"2 pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and will have a bat. Bollinger to Dilshan, OUT there is no getting away this time, Doug's bounce has done Dilshan, he has been getting it to take off consistently, Dilshan's instinct is to go after it as it bounces close to off stump, too high he finds out as he gets an edge on its way to Haddin Lee to Upul Tharanga, OUT Lee has gone through Tharanga, pretty ordinary shot and the stumps are splattered, it was the slower one from Lee, 125.3 kph, full and on the stumps, Tharanga just had a huge heave at it, and played all over it Johnson to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide too wide this time outside off stump, even Mahela in this want-to-drive mood won't go after that Doherty to Sangakkara, OUT Sanga goes this time, he comes down the track, and does what he had been wanting to for quite some time, gets to the pitch and connects well with the lofted shot, but he has got it too flat and Lee takes a fine tumbling catch at long on, so Doherty breaks the stand for Australia, it had started to assume slightly worrisome proportions Doherty to Silva, OUT another one, Doherty strikes again, Silva has gone for nothing, pushing forward to one pitching on the off stump, it does not turn and goes on with the angle, he plays for it, outside the line as a result, is struck on the pads, and is given right away, that would have hit leg Lee to Eranga, OUT and gets one first ball, Eranga tries to hop in the air and cut a bouncing short one outside off, picks out third man who does not have to move at all Doherty to Prasanna, OUT is that another one, Prasanna goes for the review as umpire Hill gives him out leg before, it was the tossed up ball that carried straight in, he pushed outside the line and was struck on the pad, that would have hit middle and off, and Sri Lanka have lost the review, best figures for Xavier Doherty Lee to Malinga, OUT right through him, backing away, Lee keeps it full, moving in late on the stumps, Malinga goes nowhere with the swipe and that is the end of the innings With Silva out of touch, they had five batsmen. Two fell to wild shots, the third found the fielder on his first aggressive shot and the fourth charged blindly as soon as he came in. Too much left for the fifth to do, even if he is of the class of Mahela Jayawardene Eranga to Marsh, 1 leg bye shuffles and nudges one off the pads behind square leg Eranga to Clarke, 1 wide tries the short ball, and he allows it go past him close to off, called wide for height Australia have back-to-back series wins in Sri Lanka, they won here in 2003-04 as well. It was a pretty safe chase till Marsh's dismissal led to two more wickets in the same over from debutant Prasanna.

Smart stats Australia won with 132 balls to spare, which is their second-largest ODI win in Sri Lanka in terms of balls remaining. For Sri Lanka, though, this was their largest defeat at home. Only six times have Sri Lanka been bowled out for a lower total in home ODIs."
"Hussey to Dilshan, 1 wide ah, they have conceded a proper extra now. Wide down the leg side. Hussey to Upul Tharanga, 1 wide Extras today are like London buses. Another wide down the leg side. Bollinger to Dilshan, OUT Irony, thy name, cricket! Dilshan is gone, but the manner in which he has fallen explains everything about this lovely game. Bollinger has bowled superbly all day, without getting a wicket. And now he gets one with one of his lesser hostile balls. It was short, it was angling in, and Dilshan saw it early. There was a man at deep midwicket, but Dilshan wanted to take him on and went for the pull. He ended up timing it too well, hit it emphatically, right out of the screws, but dead str Bollinger to Sangakkara, 1 wide overcooks the bouncer and it called a wide for height. Lee to Upul Tharanga, FOUR runs bang! Lee pitches it in Tharanga's half and he frees his arms with glee. Stays in the crease, keeps the head down and launches this imperiously, almost all the way over midwicket. It was such a good shot that umpire Rauf signalled six straight away. It's just short though. Bollinger to Sangakkara, OUT and a wicket straight away! He's ducked this one full on the leg stump, Sanga misses the flick and it is hit on the pads. Umpire Ranmore Martinesz (what a name!) gave that immediately, and Sanga referred it on Tharanga's advice. No luck. Pitches on the stumps as he shuffles across, hits in front of middle and it is more than clipping leg. The decision stays and SL take a bit of a blow at the start of the Powerplay. Bollinger to Chandimal, OUT stunning catch! Australia are rallying here. That's a replay of his dismissal from the first game. Bolly angles it across Chandimal who again pushes across and feels for it, away from the body. It takes the edge and flies to the left of Clarke at the only slip, he dives away and fumbles it as he goes for it with both hands, but clutches to it behind him on the rebound, using the left hand. Bollinger to Upul Tharanga, OUT Irony once again. Tharanga has edged so many times today, he has played and missed so many times today. He falls to Bollinger, who caused him most of the problems today, but it is not an edge! Short of a length ball on off stump, Tharanga tries to back away and guide it to third man, and ends up steering it straight into Haddin's gloves. Straight off the face of the blade. Good innings, but Tharanga will be the first to admit he's played much better than this several times. Bollinger to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 leg bye trapped on the crease with a length ball ducking in towards middle and leg. Big appeal from Bolly, but it's not upheld. They scramble for a single and it is declared a leg-bye. Lee to Silva, OUT appeal for a freaky catch. What's happened there? Yorker scorching in towards leg stump, it hits Silva's left foot on the full and then, as it comes up, it hits the bat which was completing a flick and pops up tamely to midwicket. A pad-bat catch. Johnson to Jeevan Mendis, OUT another one bites a dust. Mitch gets into the act and Jeevan is out, as plumb an lbw as you will see. Full, pacy and curving in towards middle and leg. Jeevan ambitiously plonked the front foot forward and looked to slam it over the leg side, and ended up playing all over it. The umpire's decision was quick, he's pinned in front of middle and leg. Johnson to Kulasekara, 1 wide Mitch angles this too far down the leg side and it is a wide. Watson to Eranga, 1 wide and it a zippy bouncer that he can't connect with. Called a wide for height again. Watson to Mahela Jayawardene, SIX runs Oh Mahela, you thing of absolute beauty! He's standing deep in the crease, and then even as Watto gets into his delivery stride he shuffles across to off stump and squares up for a full length ball. It comes, and he laps it around with sublime timing. Over short fine leg. Over where deep fine leg will be. Over the ropes. By some distance. What stupendous timing! Watson to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT and he's gone after playing a little gem. Watson keeps it full and angling in again, Mahela looks to whip-lash over deep square leg, but finds the fielder. SL were completely losing course when he came in, and kept losing wickets. He saw them through a tricky phase and opened up at the very end. Watson to Eranga, OUT Watson messes up the stumps with the perfect yorker. Eranga plays the copy book straight drive, but can't connect. Malinga to Haddin, 1 leg bye on the pads again, Haddin misses the glide off the hips and they gets a leg-bye. Kulasekara to Ponting, 1 leg bye angled in towards Ponting's pads and he nudges it along backward of square leg for one. Eranga to Haddin, 1 wide Eranga seems to have a natural wrist positioning geared for the inswinger or the inducker. The ball angles in again and this time goes down the leg side. Eranga to Clarke, 1 wide and now he gets some nip outside off, Clarke moves into line and then lets it go. Eranga to Clarke, 1 wide Eranga lets another wide go down the leg side. Eranga to Hussey, 1 wide Eranga lets this go down the leg side and it is called a wide. Malinga to Hussey, 1 wide wicked bouncer, too short and called a wide for height. This has happened too many times today. Mendis to Smith, 3 leg byes huge lbw appeal not given and SL are out of review(s). Googly, lands outside off and breaks in, Smith misses it completely and it hits the pad just outside off. Close! Kulasekara to Smith, OUT oh my. Smith has done something really bizarre here, feeding his critics with more ammo to have a go at him. It was a full ball well outside off, Smith got across to it and drove it to the on-side, and set off for the single. It's been his one-point agenda today - get the single. Except that, this time, he had played it straight to Kula and taken off. And then he just stands and looks as Kula moves to his right, picks up and hurls down the stumps. Not quite Roger Harper, but good enoug ""Tharanga, Eranga, Malinga. SL go 'Bazinga' !"" - My submission for the six-word report, just in case it doesn't get featured there."" - I am forwarding that to the Page 2 team, Krish. On that note, it is time to say cheers and goodnight. Brydon Coverdale's match report has the details of the game in words, and our gallery does the same in pictures. Two games to go, and it is still a must-win situation for SL. See you again for game 4, until then it is goodbye from Nitin Sundar and the rest of the gang. Player of the match is Upul Tharanga, SL","Sri Lanka 286 for 9 (Tharanga 111, Dilshan 55, Bollinger 4-42) beat Australia 208 (M Hussey 63, Malinga 5-28) by 78 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Upul Tharanga made his fourth ODI century of the year AFP Upul Tharanga's fourth one-day international century this year and a five-wicket haul from Lasith Malinga kept the series alive as Sri Lanka compiled a comfortable 78-run victory in Hambantota. After two substandard batting performances in the opening matches, Sri Lanka finally found their rhythm and their 286 was too tall a target for Australia, who lead 2-1 as the teams head to Colombo for the final two games in the series. It was a solid all-round performance from Sri Lanka: Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara contributed useful runs and the work of the batsmen was well backed up by the outstanding Malinga and his bowling colleagues. Especially impressive was the debutant seamer Shaminda Eranga, who struck in his first over and deceived Ricky Ponting to keep Australia on the back foot early in their chase. Eranga, 25, needed only three balls to make his mark on international cricket, with a delivery that nipped through the ever-widening gate left by an out-of-form Brad Haddin, who made 5."
"13.50 We are ten minutes away from the toss. Moody expects it to be a bat-first track. His co-commentator Roshan Abeyasinghe agrees with him, citing some cracks in the pitch. It's very windy in Hambantota. Lee to Dilshan, OUT Inswinger. Timber. Dilshan has been a touch late with the fuller deliveries, and this one is slightly shorter than the driving length, and sneaks in through the big gap between bat and pad. Middle stump is out, Lee is thrilled Johnson to Upul Tharanga, 1 leg bye this one moves into the batsman, hits Tharanga on the pads. Johnson appeals, but clearly it is going down the leg side Johnson to Upul Tharanga, OUT Johnson strikes. His red-hot form continues. Digs this one in short, outside off, Tharanga looks to sway out of the line, but doesn't quite take the gloves out of the way. The ball doesn't quite rise up, and kisses the glove on the way Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, 2 wide slightly dozey by Haddin, this is down the leg side, but not too wide, Haddin gets both his gloves to it, but it bounces out. Holds the hand up in apology immediately Doherty to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Doherty gets his man, he has been frustrating Mahela with his accurate bowling and the drift that has been getting. Mahela goes for the big sweep from outside off, and places it right down deep square leg's throat Bollinger to Chandimal, OUT awesome bowling... the bouncer is followed up by the length ball, in the channel outside off. Chandimal is sitting inside the crease after that bouncer, and just leaves the bat to fry. The edge is taken. Good disciplined persistence from Australia o Johnson to Herath, OUT late swing for Johnson, accurate too, this pitches middle and off, and swings in, beats the bat, hits the pad for a pretty straightforward decision for Tony Hill Malinga to Watson, 1 wide starts off with a wide down the leg side Kulasekara to Haddin, OUT Sanga has taken a special catch standing up! Haddin attempts another big drive on the ump, this one doesn't swing as much as he expects it to, takes the outside edge, and straight into Sanga's gloves. Not a big deflection, but still a superb catch when Herath to Watson, SIX runs whoa. What a pull. Decimating Herath here. Again only slightly short, but Watson picks the length early, and pulls this over midwicket. Hits the ice box just outside the rope Malinga to Ponting, 2 wide wide down the leg side, swings late, Sanga dives and saves the boundary Malinga to Watson, OUT the bat-pad gap is created this time! Clatter behind Watson. Noise in the stands again. This is full and straight, starts around off, tails in late, Watson looks for a drive down the ground, but is beaten by the swing. Middle and leg stumps are disturbed Herath to Ponting, 1 wide tossed up outside leg, no turn Herath to Clarke, SIX runs imperious, Clarke is stepping up, tossed up and he sensed a chance, charged down the track, got to the pitch and smashed it high and handsome over long-on Malinga to Clarke, 1 leg bye short ball, surprises Clarke, who lets it hit hie forearm Dilshan to Clarke, SIX runs Captain is denying former captain a century. Jokes apart, though, this is a superb shot. Comes down the track, is close enough to the pitch of the ball, and goes inside-out over wide long-off Malinga to Ponting, 1 wide short, Ponting gets under it, called wide. Slightly down the leg side, I think Fifth ODI win in a row for Australia, and how convincing this has been. Set up by the bowlers on a flat wicket. They were disciplined, bowled to a plan, and never let the pressure off. And it was must fun to watch Ponting back in form. Playing with certainty and freedom. I would stil That's all we have for you tonight. Thanks for keeping us company on a Sunday. Do join us for the rest of the series. Okay bye Australia won by 8 wickets (with 70 balls remaining) Player of the match is Ricky Ponting, AUS","Australia 211 for 2 (Ponting 90*, Clarke 58*) beat Sri Lanka 208 (Sangakkara 52, Bollinger 3-35) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ricky Ponting made an unbeaten 90 in Australia's chase AFP Perhaps Tillakaratne Dilshan should send Australia in next time. He needs to do something to shake his team out of its slumber after another professional performance from Australia, this time led by Doug Bollinger with the ball and Ricky Ponting with the bat, set up a comfortable eight-wicket win and a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. In Pallekele last Wednesday, Dilshan won the toss and chose to bat, and his men were bowled out for a sub-par total that the attack couldn't defend. The venue has changed but the result was exactly the same this time around, as he again chose to bat and the Sri Lankan top order again failed to build a target that would worry Michael Clarke's side. Australia were set 209 for victory, and they got there with 11."
"2 pm: Sri Lanka win the toss and will have a bat Bollinger to Dilshan, 1 leg bye and troubles him with the change in angle, dropping it back of a length and hitting Dilshan on the body as he is caught on the crease, ball rolls away behind point Watson to Dilshan, 1 leg bye gets the single now, Watson goes with the angle on the pads and he trickles it square on the leg side Doherty to Upul Tharanga, OUT Doherty strikes, Tharanga went back as he saw a marginally shortish one, it turned in sharply and beat his attempted cut to hit off stump, he was looking really good, Doherty is pumped up Hussey to Dilshan, OUT Dilshan has thrown it away, he was looking increasingly impatient, got down the track as he saw some flight outside off, but was still not close enough to the ball as he blasted it straight to mid off Johnson to Sangakkara, OUT Johnson has got Sanga, huge wicket, it is the slower one, bowled full close to off for the drive, mighty useful on this track, Sanga comes forward and looks to push hard. but pops it straight to short extra cover Johnson to Jeevan Mendis, OUT Johnson is pumped up, he has gone through Mendis' defenses with a pacy yorker from over the stumps that swung in a bit late to clatter in to off and middle Johnson to Angelo Mathews, OUT Angelo becomes the latest Sri Lanka batsman to throw it away, these shots are certainly not on on this pitch, he looks to come down the track and make room to clobber a pitched up delivery over mid off, but cannot clear the man, straight to him Lee to Randiv, 1 wide Lee gives him the bouncer, and is called for a wide as it sails over the batsman Johnson to Randiv, OUT they have finally broken the partnership, it is Johnson again, five for him, Randiv goes for the big lofted shot down the ground off a full delivery, but mishits it high in the air and Doherty settles under it at long off and takes it cleanly Johnson to Mendis, OUT and gets his sixth with a slanted length ball that hits the top of off stump, Mendis just went pushing away from his body and was nowhere near the line of the ball Smith to Kulasekara, SIX runs makes room and lofts him just over Bollinger at long off, got way outside leg stump and went for the big one, Bollinger leaped high to try and get to it but it eluded him Lee to Kulasekara, OUT superb shot, but what a catch from Mike Hussey, Lee gets his 350th ODI wicket, banged it in short and Nuwan cracked the pull right out of the middle of the bat, it was dying in front of Hussey at deep midwicket, but he dived forward to take the ball close to the ground Career-best figures for Mitchell Johnson - also the fourth-best by an Australian in ODIs - have given Australia a target that they should chase down. The way Sri Lanka started, it seemed 300 was on but their top order threw away their wickets with aggressive shots chasing wide deliveries. Nuwan and Suraj Lakmal to Watson, SIX runs this has disappeared, Watson sees this one pitched a bit short and latches on to it, he creams the pull so powerfully that it flies flat over the deep midwicket boundary Kulasekara to Watson, SIX runs Swatto's the word, he has really gone after this one, he is waiting for those marginally short ones, this one comes in off the seam, and he murders it way over deep midwicket Randiv to Watson, OUT Watson has fallen, the method was bound to come undone at least off one delivery, happened this time, Randiv tossed it up around middle and leg, Watson lunged for the sweep, and got a top edge that swirled to the man at short fine leg who went a few steps back and to his left Randiv to Clarke, 1 leg bye turning down the leg side and he gets a tickle fine on it That will be all from us for this game. Join us for the 2nd ODI on Sunday from Hambantota. This is Abhishek Purohit signing off. Thanks for all the feedback. Cheers! Australia won by 7 wickets (with 71 balls remaining) Player of the match is Mitchell Johnson, AUS","Australia 192 for 3 (Watson 69, Clarke 53*, Ponting 53) beat Sri Lanka 191 (Randiv 41, Johnson 6-31) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Johnson was Man of the Match for his 6 for 31 AFP Mitchell Johnson produced the fourth-best figures in Australia's one-day history to set his team on the path to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in Pallekele. After losing the Twenty20s, Australia found a new spark with the arrival of the 50-over captain Michael Clarke, who attacked in the field and then helped steer the side home with Ricky Ponting after Shane Watson set up the chase. Smart stats Sri Lanka's seven-wicket defeat is only their sixth in 34 home ODIs when they've won the toss and chosen to bat since 2000. Mitchell Johnson's 6 for 31 are his best figures in ODIs, and the fourth-best by an Australian. In 31 ODIs in Asia, Johnson has taken 60 wickets at an average of 20."
"Lee to Dilshan, OUT Given out lbw! Lee is so convinced he doesn't even appeal until he has reached the stumps at the striker's end. This is a length ball, angling into the pads, Dilshan moves across, plays across the line, and misses. My initial reaction was that it might be going down, but I am neither the umpire nor the replay ope Smith to Chandimal, OUT His tendency to play to leg has got him! For the second time in this over he tries to work a legbreak to from well outside off to the leg side. Gets a healthy leading edge that carries to Smith Johnson to Perera, OUT the short ball does the job for Johnson. This is just outside off, shoulder-high, and Perera upper-cuts this one straight down Watson's throat at third man Smith to Mahela Jayawardene, SIX runs top shot again, moves across early, gets on a knee, and plays the regulation sweep in the air, and over the square leg fieldsman Smith to Sangakkara, SIX runs Sangakkara! Charges at Smith, not quite to the pitch of the ball, but goes ahead with the slog sweep. Flat, flat six accrues Hastings to Sangakkara, OUT Duke has got a wicket here. Just back of a length, Sanga manufactures the pull shot, hits it powerfully too, but straight to White at midwicket. The captain contributes Hastings to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 leg bye Jayawardene walks right across the stumps, hit in front of the stumps, but this could just be going over the stumps. Leg-bye conceded Hastings to Angelo Mathews, OUT I can tell you John Wayne Hastings is showing his worth here, with his third wicket in his third over. Mathews charges at him and makes room, but Hastings bowls one aimed at top of off, Mathews looks to open the face but is too late O'Keefe to Perera, OUT Perera looks to send this out of Kandy, but hardly reaches long-on with a thick edge. Smith from long-on charges in and makes a dive to get his fingers under it Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT some luck finally for Australia. This is a length ball on the pads, the kind T20 batsmen hit for sixes blindfolded. Mahela, though, gets too much under it, and finds deep midwicket Lee to Mendis, 5 wide what a horror ball... sees No. 11 shuffle across and bowls down the leg side, but well wide, and beats Haddin too - five wides We are back for what promises to be a fun second half. Out come Watson and Warner. Kulasekara to bowl his big inswingers, and the surprise straight ones. One slip in Perera to Watson, SIX runs another one, Australia are dominating this chase, bowled flatter by Dilruwan on the off stump but Watto had made up his mind, bent low, took it from outside off and smote it into the crowd behind the deep midwicket boundary Herath to Watson, SIX runs mis-hit for six... Watto's fourth off the last five balls he has faced. he went for the slog sweep here, didn't quite reach the pitch of the ball, but still sent it sailing over wide long-on Mendis to Marsh, OUT Marsh couldn't read Mendis if he wrote it in all caps... this is the fllghted googly, Marsh is sucked out of the crease, is beaten in the flight, plays for the legbreak, is beaten by the turn away from him. Sanga does the rest. Boy, are Sri Lanka back in this one? Herath to White, SIX runs bear pays a superb shot here... he has begun to look confident now. Makes room, goes inside-out, goes bug, over extra cover. That's the White we knew in the better days Herath to Smith, 1 wide carrom ball, but misdirected, pitches leg, and goes further down Mendis to Smith, OUT Mendis is operating in a language completely alien to the Aussies. There is this massive panic that is overcoming them at the sight of Mendis. Smith has been playing good orthodox cricket until now, but he makes room here, and this carrom ball goes straight on as opposed to turning away. Smith's bat is outside Mendis to Haddin, OUT Whoa! Five six, pick up the sticks! Australia are not reading him at all. Increase the font size, Ajantha. This is the googly, well flighted, Hadding plays for the leg break, this pitches well outside off, and takes the top of off. Five wickets in 14 balls! First five-for for SL in T20Is That's all we have from the T20 series. Do join us for the first ODI on August 10. Until then, this is Sidharth Monga saying goodbye. Cheers Player of the match is Ajantha Mendis, SL","Sri Lanka 157 for 9 (Jayawardene 86, Hastings 3-14, Lee 3-39) beat Australia 149 for 9 (Watson 57, Mendis 6-16) by eight runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details There was no stopping Ajantha Mendis today Associated Press Ajantha Mendis turned tricks beyond the grasp of six Australian batsmen as Sri Lanka completed an eight-run victory for a 2-0 sweep of the Twenty20 series at Pallekele. Playing his first, but surely not last, match against the Australians on this tour, Mendis plucked 6 for 16, the best figures in international T20 history, including three of the four wickets to fall for four runs in a frenzied 16-ball phase in the middle overs. All this after Shane Watson's belligerent 57 from 24 balls seemed to have set the visitors up for a series-levelling victory. The pivotal moment of the evening came thanks to Angelo Mathews' remarkable feat of athleticism, when he collected a David Warner heave on the edge of the midwicket boundary, and then threw the ball back into play for Mahela Jayawardene to complete the catch. Watson was close to lbw in the first over of the chase, the umpire ruling that Nuwan Kulasekara's extravagant inswing would have taken the ball past leg stump."
"Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT Timber... The yorker. Jayawardene backs away again, Lee goes full, and in front of leg, Jayawardene gets bat onto it, but only to guide it to the the off stump Lee to Chandimal, 1 wide Lee welcomes him with a bouncer, but well down the leg side Lee to Chandimal, 1 leg bye full and fast, but into the pads, concedes the leg-bye Lee to Dilshan, SIX runs It's a harsh harsh game... This is a superb bouncer, quick, at the throat, Dilshan is late into the shot, but the top edge sails past the pulled-in boundary ropes behind fine leg Johnson to Chandimal, OUT Hit wicket! I don't remember any hit-wickets in T20 internationals. This might well be a first. It's a length ball on the pads, but the extra pace forces him deep into the crease, the bat comes down real late, and the over-balanced Chandimal's front leg goes across and hits the stumps. It Watson to Dilshan, 1 leg bye Dilshan tries the scoop first ball, but is hit in the shoulder, and still gets a leg-bye Watson to Sangakkara, OUT what a soft dismissal, lot of premeditation in it as he walks down the wicket. The ball is not nearly full enough, and is also the slower one, and Sanga ends up chipping it straight to midwicket Lee to Jeevan Mendis, 1 wide another wide yorker, Mendis is beaten while going on side, but this is too wide, and is called Kulasekara to Watson, OUT Bowled him! This inswinger is perfect. Short of driving length, and starts well outside off so it can hit top of off. Watson tries to smash it through the off side, leaves the bat-pad gap open, and is bowled. ah, there is an inside edge too, which drags the ball to top of middle Lakmal to Warner, 1 leg bye hits him in the pad with a yorker, but it is swinging down the leg side, hence no lbw Perera to Warner, 1 wide pushed down the leg side.. no turn first ball Perera to Marsh, OUT Gets a wicket in his first over! This one turned away too, beats an attempt to play it to on, hits him in front. Interesting to see where it pitched. Pitches middle leg, hits him in front of leg after straightening. Would have gone on to hit the leg stumps, I think Kulasekara to Warner, 1 wide starts off with a wide yorker, a touch too wide Perera to O'Keefe, SIX runs O'Keefe slogs this one for six, clears the front leg, and swings merrily. It's a length ball on the pads, which helps Kulasekara to Johnson, SIX runs Lovely clean swing, almost golf-like, over long-on. Admires the shot, and it is worth admiring Prasad to Hastings, SIX runs Australia finish off in style... but lose by 35 runs! Hastings clears the front leg, gets down on the knee, and slogs this for the biggest six of the night So, as comprehensive as T20 wins get. Sri Lanka displayed better skill, better application, and better knowledge of conditions. Dilshan scored his maiden T20 hundred, Sang and Mendis supported him, and then debutant Perera ripped the heart out of Australia's batting with three wickets. Well-deserved cheers from the crow That's all from today. Do join us for the second T20I on Monday. Cheers Player of the match is Tillakaratne Dilshan, SL","Sri Lanka 198 for 3 (Dilshan 104*) beat Australia 163 for 8 (Warner 52, Dilruwan 3-26) by 35 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details There was both brute-force hitting and innovation in Tillakaratne Dilshan's century AFP Sri Lanka's captain Tillakaratne Dilshan struck a compelling century then marshalled his team neatly in the field to secure a 35-run victory over Australia in the first Twenty20 international in Kandy. Sent in to bat at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, the hosts were headed for a total of about 150 before Dilshan (104, 57 balls, 12 fours, five sixes) and the allrounder Jeevan Mendis (29, 19 balls) combined for a stand of 104 runs in a mere 45 balls to lift the hosts to 198 for 3. Dilshan hammered 67 from his final 23 deliveries, a sequence that effectively decided the match. The Australians' chase was undone by the flat offspin of the debutant Dilruwan Perera (3-26), who provided a reminder there is plenty of slow bowling depth for the Sri Lankans to utilise across the limited overs and Test series to take place through August and September. Rangana Herath (1-11) also posed plenty of problems, much as he had done on his debut against the Australians on their 1999 visit to the island."
"Herath to Marsh, OUT Bowled'im! His average falls to 111! A potential nelson has struck. Is this a break in concentration or a natural variation? It's a regulation offbreak from Herath, Marsh defends, but it doesn't turn in as much as he expects it to. The off stumps is left exposed, and pegged back Eranga to Haddin, OUT loud appeal for caught behind and Haddin's been given, he isn't happy with the decision and asks for a review. The ball pitched on a good length outside off and seamed away a touch, Haddin did not come forward and pushed at it. There was a noise as it passed the bat and there's no conclusive evidence to suggest th Welegedara to Siddle, OUT caught at first slip! Welegedara angles a good length ball across the right-hander, Siddle pokes tentatively at it and edges to first slip. Another easy catch. Siddle looks back at Hussey, who's at the other end on 99, before walking off. Welegedara to Copeland, OUT caught at second slip! Copeland has a flash at one that angles across him from over the wicket. He edges it hard but straight to Mahela Jayawardene at second slip and he's taken far harder catches than this. That was a low catch though, Jayawardene got his fingers under the ball just in time. Copeland seemed Eranga to Hussey, OUT bowled him! Eranga caps a fine performance on debut with a slower ball, Hussey comes forward to push at it but gets an inside edge on to the stumps. Hussey goes after a terrific century - his 15th in Tests - and steering Australia past 300 Lyon to HAPW, SIX runs PJ take SL to 400 with a six! This is low in trajectory again, PJ charges at him, reaches the pitch of the ball, and lofts him over wide long-on. Cow corner, since it is time for cows to come back home Siddle to Thirimanne, OUT bowled him! Thirimanne's off stump has taken a beating. Siddle pitches the ball full just outside off stump and brings it back in just a little, enough to find the gap between the batsman's attempted drive and pad. There might have been a faint inside edge too Johnson to NT Paranavitana, OUT caught at short cover by Ponting, whose reflexes I covet. The ball was ordinary, full and outside off, there to be driven. Paranavitana went hard at it, and made proper contact, smashing the drive out of the middle. His only fault was that he hit it in the air just above Ponting's head. Up went those han Siddle to Herath, OUT lbw! Tony Hill gives Herath out but the batsman asks for the review. The ball was full from Siddle, it pitched in line with the stumps and crashed into the pad before it hit the bat as Herath tried to play on the leg side after moving across his crease. That's plumb, hitting middle and off. The decision stays. Ma Innings Start Here we go for the fourth innings. What a thriller. Copeland has the ball. Can he pick a fiver? Three slips.","Sri Lanka 473 (Mathews 105*, Dilshan 83, Sangakkara 79, M Jayawardene 51, Siddle 4-91) and 7 for 0 drew with Australia 316 (Hussey 118, Marsh 81, Eranga 4-65, Welegedara 3-75) and 488 (Hughes 126, Clarke 112, Hussey 93, Herath 7-157) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Michael Clarke made his first Test hundred as Australia's captain AFP Smart stats Michael Hussey's aggregate of 463 runs in the series is the fourth-highest overall by a batsman in a three-Test series in Sri Lanka and the second-highest among visiting batsmen after Brian Lara's 688 runs in 2001-02. This is the fourth time that Australia have scored over 400 in their second innings in Sri Lanka. On the three previous occasions, they went on to win the Test. Michael Clarke scored his 15th century in Tests. It is also his first century since his 168 against New Zealand in March 2010."
"Smith to Smith, 4 byes beaten first ball. Smith is drawn out to play a really full delivery, misses it, but it goes between Haddin's legs. Nearly a yorker for him, so only a half chance for the stumping Smith to Smith, OUT Smith reviews this, Steven that is. Graeme has once again tried that cute reverse-sweep, misses, Haddin and Steven go up immediately. Umpire says no. Smith reviews immediately. The replays suggest a tiny little noise noise as the ball passes the glove, but there is no visual confirmation in normal replays. Doherty to du Plessis, OUT he has walked past this one. This is superbly bowled. He jumps out of the crease again, Doherty gets a little bit of drift, a little of dip, which opens him up slightly. He is not close to the pitch now, and ends up feeling for the ball. It pitches one a length in front of leg, turns away, beats the Smith to Miller, SIX runs Miller counterattacks. The second ball he faces. Comes down the track, right to the pitch of the ball, and smashes it for a parallel six over long-off Cummins to Miller, OUT and strikes right away. Miller is gone after playing a forceful, momentum-grabbing innings. He backs away, trying to hit it over the off side, the ball is short of a length, and angles away. A thick edge is taken, and settles with Haddin Cummins to Boucher, 1 leg bye length ball, angling down the leg side, concedes a leg-bye Bollinger to Boucher, 1 wide sees him charging at him, Bollinger bowls full and wide outside off, but it is called a wide Tsotsobe to Ponting, OUT du Plessis is claiming a low catch at cover-point. Ponting is not moving. This is short, angling away, game for cut, but the tennis-ball bounce means it comes slower and higher. Ponting ends up hitting uppishly and in front of square. Replays show he has been taken. Clean as a whistel, low in front of Morkel to Clarke, 1 leg bye short again, worked away off the hip for a single Morkel to Clarke, OUT Morne Morkel bowls a beauty. They say hit the top of off, Morne bowls just by top of off. You can't do much more than defend these balls. Clarke plays for the angle, but misjudges the angle and gets the edge. Graeme Smith's bucket hands at first slip do the rest Duminy to Smith, 1 leg bye worked away off the pads, around the corner Morkel to Warner, OUT just too much pressure of the asking rate I suppose. And Morkel is not the bowler you can have your way with. This time the bounce gets a touch big, Warner's pull generates a hefty top edge, Boucher goes back towards short fine leg, and catches this swirling ball over his shoulder. Had to drag this pull Kallis to Watson, SIX runs Beware the wounded batsman lads. Kallis digs this in short, never mind that Watson is forward, he clubs this for a flat six over square leg Tsotsobe to Watson, OUT and on cue Tsotsobe strikes, and that's the game. Slower ball, 118ks, on a length, middle and leg, Watson clears the front leg to go over cow corner, is early into the shot, and ends up dragging it straight to deep square. They all surround Lopsy Tsotsobe to Haddin, 1 bye slower ball, a grubber, bounces well short of Boucher. They take a bye off the ricochet Kallis to Johnson, 1 wide wide down the leg side Steyn to Cummins, 1 wide slips down the leg side for a wide Steyn to Doherty, OUT Bowled out off the last ball. Full toss outside off, drives with an open face, Duminy catches it at point, and hands it over to the leg umpire, who at the moment is at point because the left-hand batsman is on strike. Doherty's average takes a blow, he had a great chance of ending not-out A comprehensive win for South Africa. Fireworks go around at St George's Park. SA batted really well on this slow track, with fur men getting fifties. With Watson injured and two early wickets, it was always going to be tough. Hussey and Warner fought, but once they went it was all over, even though the inured Watson came out and hi That's all we have tonight. Thanks for joining us, thanks for writing in. Cheers Player of the match is Morne Morkel, SA","South Africa 303 for 6 (Kallis 76, Miller 59, Smith 57, Duminy 56) beat Australia 223 (Warner 74, Morkel 4-22) by 80 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Morne Morkel was outstanding with 4 for 22 as Australia struggled AFP South Africa regained parity in the ODI series against Australia - and valuable equilibrium after an extended break from international cricket - with a resounding 80-run victory in the second match at St George's Park. Where the hosts had looked out of sorts with the bat and rusty in the field at Centurion, they now clambered all over a touring side that was both inconvenienced and worried by a back complaint for the vice-captain Shane Watson, on his return to the team from a hip injury. Watson staggered off the field after wincing in pain upon the delivery of the fifth ball of his fourth over and must now be in doubt for the deciding third match in Durban despite batting later. His absence in the field was keenly felt as South Africa ran up an imposing 303 for 6 via sizeable contributions from Jacques Kallis, Graeme Smith, David Miller and JP Duminy. All the Australian pacemen were taken for runs, Pat Cummins delivering one maiden but otherwise finding the going harder than at any stage so far in his infant international career."
"Morkel to Ponting, 1 wide Morkel's a bit all over the place at the moment. This one is pushed too far down the leg side, and called wide Botha to Ponting, 5 wide has he got bat on this? Botha gave this one a lot more air but looped it down the leg side, and Ponting just needed a thin glance to get it to the fine leg boundary Botha to Ponting, OUT backing up, what a way to go! We've seen a few of these of late. Ponting used his feet, drilled it down the pitch where Botha got a hand on it and Clarke was backing up well out of his crease Steyn to Ponting, OUT picks out backward point. It was full and wide, Ponting connected quite well but Botha didn't have to move too far to his right Kallis to Haddin, OUT lofted down to long on, got underneath this too much and it almost went straight up Steyn to Hussey, 1 leg bye well bowled, Hussey shaped to move outside leg and Steyn fired the ball full at his pads and it rebounded down to third man Johnson to Kallis, 1 wide loses his line down the leg side, that will happen with Johnson Bollinger to Kallis, SIX runs that's a wonderful shot, picks up a short ball off leg stump and lofts it onto the grass banks behind long leg...all timing that shot, not brute force Doherty to Boucher, OUT there's an appeal from Doherty as Boucher misses a flick to leg and is hit on the pads, but it's quickly quashed. How close was this? Doherty doesn't look that confident, but Clarke wants to review it. Yep, it pitched in line and would've taken out middle and leg, Boucher is out! Bollinger to Steyn, 1 leg bye there's a speculative appeal from Bollinger as Steyn is struck on the pad, but this landed well outside leg and the end result is a scampered leg bye Player of the match is Ricky Ponting, AUS","Australia 183 for 4 (Ponting 63, Clarke 44) beat South Africa 129 (Johnson 3-20, Cummins 3-28) by 93 runs (D/L method) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke added 102 for the second wicket on either side of the rain break Getty Images Australia were inconvenienced more by rain than South Africa as they rampaged through the hosts in a truncated first ODI in Centurion, winning by 93 runs under Duckworth-Lewis calculations. Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey guided the tourists to 183 for 4 from 29 overs, setting a target of 223, before the debutant Pat Cummins and Mitchell Johnson shared six wickets to lead their team on a merry path in the field. The ball swung and bounced in greasy conditions, and in a significant portent for the matches to come, Johnson gained the kind of movement through the air that had helped make him so fearsome on Australia's 2009 visit to South Africa. Mitchell Marsh, the other teenaged debutant, claimed a wicket in his first over. The spin of Xavier Doherty was also useful as the Proteas subsided, none passing 30 in a searching captaincy introduction for the interim leader Hashim Amla."
"2.05pm Australia have won the toss and will bat first, which isn't at all unexpected in Joburg as conditions are generally pretty good for batting. Shane Watson's injury means that Matthew Wade will open with David Warner, debutant Mitchell Marsh slotting in for the injured Watto. Tsotsobe to Warner, 1 wide Warner looked to come forward at the bowler but Tsotsobe responded with a nippy bouncer ... unfortunately for him, he dug it in a little too short and that's another wide Morkel to Warner, OUT gone this time! Warner slashes at a length delivery, slicing under the ball and sending it looping towards mid off ... where the fielder charges in and holds a good, sliding catch. Two ducks in two games for Warner Morkel to Wade, 1 wide Morkel loses his direction just a touch, pushing this one down the leg side Theron to Marsh, OUT well-caught by Kuhn! Marsh aimed to heave Theron's first delivery over midwicket but sliced under the ball. The swirling chance came down somewhere near backward point, where Kuhn had charged and called for it. There's a slight delay as the umpire checks for the no-ball, and though it's very tight the delivery is legitimate and Marsh is on his Botha to Hussey, OUT big wicket for South Africa! Hussey has picked out long on...used his feet to Botha but didn't quite get the connection and was a well-judged catch near the boundary Botha to White, 1 wide ah, something different, speared down the leg side Tsotsobe to Smith, OUT another goes and Tsotsobe deserved that. Smith tries to work a slower ball off-cutter to the leg side and gets a leading edge to cover for a simple catch Parnell to Marsh, OUT football meets cricket! Excellent skills from Parnell in his follow through. Marsh got an inside edge into his pads which bobbled down by his feet. White called for the single, but Parnell sprinted from his follow through and kicked the ball into the stumps Theron to O'Keefe, OUT slashes outside off stump and gets a thin edge through to the keeper. Australia just can't build momentum in this innings. The umpires check for the no-ball, but this Theron has half his foot behind the line. Morkel to Marsh, SIX runs a little gem of an innings from Marsh as he crashes a full toss straight down the ground over long on...that's not an easy thing to do Morkel to Marsh, SIX runs take that! That...is...massive. Even for Jo'burg that's huge. Wrong length from Morkel - on a good length - and Marsh is able to get underneath the ball and swing it miles into the stands at deep midwicket Morkel to Marsh, OUT finally on target. A yorker extracts off stump as Marsh tries to guide it through the off side but not after some significant damage was done Bollinger to Amla, 1 wide hit that! Bollinger's response is to dig one in at his feet, and the ball balloons high over Amla's head. A clear wide Hussey to Smith, SIX runs boom! Smith lumbers down the track and clobbers one over deep midwicket. That was a bit of a crowd-killer Pattinson to Botha, 1 wide sprays this well wide of off stump and that's an easy decision for the umpire Marsh to Botha, SIX runs dropped in short and Marsh gets some of his own medicine as Botha pulls it well into the stands at deep square leg Marsh to Botha, 1 wide now he pushes this down the leg side, so pressure on Marsh Cummins to Theron, 1 leg bye nips back into the pads then bounces out towards backward point Cummins to Theron, 1 wide not a great start, short and down the leg side...this is pressure for an 18-year-old Cummins to Theron, 1 leg bye moves across his stumps, shapes to swing it over the leg side but it comes off the pads Hussey to Theron, SIX runs that's the game! Wins it with a six. What a comeback from South Africa. Down on one knee and Theron launches it over midwicket to spark the celebrations A tremendous game of Twenty20 cricket. It was all Australia when Kuhn went, but South Africa kept believing. There were doubts as to whether they had the depth in the batting, but Theron and Parnell showed otherwise with a stunning partnership. Australia inexperienced counted against them at the end, but South Africa's matchwinners aren't exactly senior figures. South Africa won by 3 wickets (with 5 balls remaining) Player of the match is Rusty Theron, SA","South Africa 148 for 7 (Botha 34, Theron 30*) beat Australia 147 for 8 (White 39, M Marsh 36, Tsotsobe 2-11) by 3 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Lonwabo Tsotsobe bowled well for his 2 for 11 AFP Wayne Parnell and Rusty Theron rescued South Africa from a seemingly hopeless position to snatch victory in the second Twenty20 and draw the series 1-1. Australia had the match all but won with five overs remaining, as South Africa needed 61 with three wickets in hand, an unlikely goal that Parnell and Theron reached with five balls to spare. In a breathtaking finish, the victory arrived with a slog-swept six over midwicket from the first ball of the final over, Theron's eyes having lit up when Cameron White handed the ball to David Hussey. But White had bowled out all his frontline men in the search for those last few wickets, and his choice was down to Hussey or the medium pace of the debutant Mitchell Marsh. It hardly mattered, though, as Parnell and Theron effectively sealed the match by taking 55 from the previous four overs, including 18 off an over from Steve O'Keefe, who was deposited over the midwicket and square-leg boundaries by Parnell."
"5.30pm South Africa have won the toss and will bat, so that's a decent start for Amla Bollinger to Smith, 1 wide Doug Bollinger's first ball in an international Twenty20 is sprayed down the leg side, and called wide Bollinger to Smith, OUT bowled him! A flat-footed Smith pokes outside off, the ball nips in off the seam and takes the inside edge, clattering into the stumps. First blood to Australia Hussey to Ingram, SIX runs palmed for six! Even Warner couldn't catch this. Lofted down the ground and it kept long-on interested. Warner leapt, timed it well, got a hand on the ball but helped it over the boundary O'Keefe to Duminy, SIX runs that's a decent blow...O'Keefe's first ball disappears into the stand over midwicket and Duminy did really well because he was almost beaten in the flight Pattinson to Ingram, OUT the partnership is broken! Pattinson floated up a slower cutter outside off and Ingram scythed the drive over cover ... but couldn't get it over Cummins out on the boundary. That'll annoy the South Africans, these two were just starting to build some real momentum Pattinson to Duminy, SIX runs boom! Pattinson's length is really off here. Another back of a length delivery and Duminy's eyes just lit up, he stepped back and creamed it into the crowd beyond the deep midwicket boundary Cummins to Duminy, OUT Cummins strikes with the slower delivery! It was another looping offcutter, which Duminy actualy seemed to have picked as he bent into a slog sweep. He sliced under the ball however, to send it rocketing up into the night sky and back down into Watson's lap at cover Cummins to Miller, OUT two wickets in two balls! Both set batsmen have been dismissed attempting big shots. Cummins pitched this one up and a shot was on, but Miller could only loft it to Warner's hands at long off Cummins to Botha, 1 wide a bouncer from Cummins, but it's misdirected and called wide Cummins to Botha, OUT three wickets in the over! Again it's the slower ball that does the trick. Botha came charging down the track and didn't know quite what to do with the delivery once it got to him. He was aiming to leg, but the leading edge lobbed weakly to cover Watson to Peterson, OUT clatter! Peterson had an almighty heave across the line at a straight one, and his leg stump was knocked out of the ground. Not much in the way of a celebration from Watto, but that wicket will almost certainly keep South Africa to less than 150 Watson to Theron, 1 leg bye a full toss strikes Theron on the pad as he backs to leg, and they hustle a leg bye to end the innings South Africa reach 146 for 7 which is a decent effort on a wicket that had some juice in it, particularly for the seamers. Duminy suggests they were looking for 160 in the interval interview, but they've done alright. He also suggests that the way to bowl to David Warner is to hit the top of off and remove his off bail with your first delivery. Good plan, perhaps Tsotsobe to Warner, OUT gone! What a start for South Africa, Warner departs. A direct hit from short fine-leg. It was a short ball to start with which Warner didn't play very well as he got into a tangle trying to pull, it lobbed in front of short fine-leg who then took aim and hit direct. Superb from Morne Morkel. Tsotsobe to Watson, 1 wide another short ball, some decent pace, but it's too far over the batsman's head and called wide Tsotsobe to Watson, SIX runs ah, that's the Watson we've become used to seeing...touch short again and this time he latches on with a big pull over deep square-leg Tsotsobe to Watson, 4 leg byes that's a shame, spoils the over as he slips outside leg stump and it takes the pad past the wicketkeeper Peterson to Watson, SIX runs that has gone miles. Horrid ball, dragged down, and Watson dispatches it into the stands over long on Botha to Marsh, OUT chopped on! Bowled! South Africa are back in the game now. Botha had flighted a couple but this one was fired in fast and flat from round the wicket. Marsh may not have quite read the change of pace, he backed away looking to cut but the ball rushed on with the arm, took the bottom edge and disturbed the leg bail Peterson to White, OUT gone this time! White tried to repeat the shot but swung across this one a little. The ball went really high again, but the distance wasn't there and Miller set himself beneath the swirling chance. Well, Australia still shouldn't panic, but this wicket will have given South Africa hope Australia won by 5 wickets (with 3 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 147 for 5 (Watson 52) beat South Africa 146 for 7 (Duminy 67, Cummins 3-25) by 5 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson played an important part in Australia's victory AFP A powerful half-century from Shane Watson helped Australia make an encouraging start to their tour of South Africa as they won the opening Twenty20 in Cape Town by five wickets. The teenage debutant Patrick Cummins collected three wickets as South Africa reached 146 for 7, led by a solid innings from JP Duminy, and the target wasn't enough to prevent Australia from turning around their recent poor T20 form. Although Australia's chase was on track for most of the innings, a couple of good late overs from Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe gave South Africa a sniff in the dying stages. Australia needed six from the final over, bowler by Rusty Theron, and a single from Matthew Wade was followed by a square-driven boundary and a single from Steven Smith to get Australia home with three balls to spare, their second win from their past nine T20s. It was also their second win under the captaincy of Cameron White, who took over from Michael Clarke in January."
"Lyon to Kallis, SIX runs he's cleared the midwicket boundary this time. He walks forward and towards the off side to lift the ball with the turn, powerful shot. The ball flew through the rarefied air of the highveld Siddle to Kallis, SIX runs what a shot that is! Kallis picks up a full ball on the pads and flicks it powerfully over the long leg boundary, he reaches 50 with that shot, and is on 11,999 Test runs Siddle to Kallis, OUT caught at midwicket! Kallis flicks a length ball off his pads straight to Khawaja at midwicket, who had to jump as the ball lobbed towards him. Kallis takes a look at the pitch after the dismissal, I think that ball stopped on him a little. Siddle is pumped and gives him a small send-off Cummins to Amla, OUT there's his first Test wicket! Cummins bowls a fullish ball outside off stump, Amla tries to play a powerful drive through cover. He reached out for it without really moving his feet and went hard at the ball. The outside edge flew rapidly to Ponting at second slip, he caught it at head height. Sharp catch. Cummins ha Hussey to Prince, 1 leg bye Prince gets hit on the pad as he tries to play off the back foot Lyon to Prince, OUT caught at mid-on! Prince has looked edgy for a while, ever since tea, and after several edges through slip against Siddle, he finally holes out at mid-on. He came out of his crease to loft the ball down the ground, he didn't get under it and so he couldn't find the elevation to clear Johnson. Siddle to de Villiers, OUT Cummins has taken a sensational catch! AB tried to pull a short of a length delivery from around of stump, the ball bounced a bit more and he ended up slicing it in the air over the bowler's head. The catch was closer to Johnson at mid-on, but Cummins tore towards it from mid-off and dived full length to take it Lyon to Philander, OUT lbw! Philander moves back and towards the off side to play across the line towards square leg, Lyon pitches the ball outside off and angles it into the right-hander. Philander misses the ball and gets hit plumb in front Clarke to Morkel, OUT edged to first slip and Watson's caught it! Clarke goes round the wicket and angles the ball across the left-hander, Morkel pushes forward and away from his body and gets a gentler edge to Watson Lyon to Steyn, SIX runs a massive hit! Steyn charges Lyon and lofts the ball through the line over wide long-on Clarke to Tahir, OUT it's over. Tahir couldn't survive the last ball and is caught at bat pad. He lunged forward to defend and got an inside edge on to the front pad, Hughes dived forward and took a low catch at short leg 4.55 pm South Africa have lost six wickets for 25 runs, collapsing from 241 for 4 to 266. A lot of the dismissals were to bad shots. Tahir to Watson, SIX runs that's a long hop and Watson has hammered it, there was a fielder on the midwicket boundary but Watson beat him with a powerful pull off the back foot Philander to Hughes, OUT caught at first slip! Hughes stayed in his crease and tried to drive a good length ball off the back foot through cover, Philander got the ball to bounce and angle away from the left-hander and the ball flew quickly off the outside edge. Kallis began to move his hands towards his right at second slip, but then sto Morkel to Khawaja, 1 wide Morkel steams in and lets the bouncer rip at 146.8 kph, it's far down leg side though and Boucher has to move to his right and leap to collect it Steyn to Ponting, OUT that looks plumb, it's been given lbw, and Ponting walks without asking for a review! Steyn bowled a fast ball, pitching outside off stump and angling into the right-hander, Ponting moved his front foot across his stumps and played slightly across the line. He missed and was hit flush on the knee roll. Plumb. Morkel to Clarke, OUT caught at first slip! Clarke's been done in by the steep bounce outside off stump. Morkel got the ball to rise sharply from just outside off stump, Clarke jumped on the back foot and tried to cut, the ball flew high, but not too high for AB de Villiers. He really should have let that ball go Steyn to Khawaja, OUT that looks stone dead, plumb as it gets, but Khawaja has appealed against the lbw decision to give him out. Steyn pitched the ball on middle stump, angling it across the left-hander, and then got it to straighten off the pitch, beating Khawaja as he played slightly forward and across the line. The ball hit him around Steyn to Hussey, OUT bowled him! Beautiful ball. Steyn pitches on a good length from over the wicket in line with the stumps and gets the ball to straighten off the pitch into the left-hander, Hussey played from his crease and tried to defend, bringing his bat slightly across his pad. The ball clips the pad before hitting off and middle s Tahir to Haddin, OUT Haddin's lbw! But he's reviewed it. In vain. That is plumb. Haddin played forward to one that drifted into him and straightened off the pitch. He played down the wrong line and was hit just below the knee roll. Replays show the ball hitting and says it's the umpire's call. Out. Tahir has his maiden Test wicket. Haddin Philander to Hughes, 1 wide Philander bowls a bouncer but it is apparently too high Steyn to Cummins, OUT caught behind! The outswinger is too good for the debutant. Steyn pitches the ball on a good length around middle and off and swings it away. Cummins pushes forward to defend and gets an edge that flies towards first slip. It won't reach first slip, though, because Boucher dives to his right and takes a good catch Steyn to Watson, SIX runs 138 kph, that's a short ball and Watson has smashed it, and how. He came on the front foot and hammered it over the midwicket boundary. There was a fielder there as well Innings Start Ravi: ""Lifeless roads, 100 means 100, etc. Are these comments subtly indicating that Sachin's centuries are not worthy?

At 215 for 6, Australia seemed to have as much of a chance to win as Haddin and Johnson had to make runs, based on their horrendous records this past year. Yet, somehow they forged a partnership of 72 to erase the bulk of the deficit, and after Haddin's exit was followed by that of Peter Siddle, Johnson and Cummins ran down the final 18 required. No 18-year-old in cricket history could have enjoyed a debut as extraordinary as Man-of-the-Match Cummins, who followed seven wickets for the Test with a batting contribution of wondrous composure. He offered one chance, a sharp return-catch to Dale Steyn when nine were still required, and the resulting boundary was critical."
"Steyn to Marsh, OUT It's taken him one ball to make a difference! Marsh's been ruled lbw, and he's being very optimistic reviewing that. Good old patent indipper, lands at pace on a length around off stump and nips in, Marsh has been solid all day, but this time he doesn't get Morkel to Hussey, OUT and another, Hussey is gone off the inside edge. Morne's getting the ball to whistle in sharply now, and it is too good for Mr Cricket. He let the previous one go, but knew it came disconcertingly close to off stump. This time he tries to stay put on the c Steyn to Haddin, OUT ah well, Aus are in big trouble now. Haddin's gone, not learning the lesson from the previous two balls. Stays on the crease again as Steyn gets fuller and closer to off stump to ensure Haddin doesn't play and miss this time. Haddin obliges, gets across and Philander to Harris, OUT a typical tail-ender job from Harris, he's holed out to mid-on in comical fashion. Bouncer outside off, its heading for his face and he tries it swat it away as if it were a bothersome fly. He gets a top-edge and it goes high, and doesn't come very low Morkel to Siddle, OUT caught at short cover! Morkel hits a good length once again and slants the ball into Siddle, who plays a loose drive. The ball lobs towards cover where AB takes a comfortable catch. Siddle's played his part, though, in a partnership of 59 Morkel to Clarke, OUT Clarke's terrific innings ends with his leg stump being detonated from the ground. He made room to a good length ball and tried to heave on the leg side, he missed and Morkel was on target Ryan Harris to open the bowling, from over the wicket. Three slips and short leg in place. The Australians are jogging out on to Newlands after a huddle. Graeme Smith and Jacques Rudolph walk down the stairs from the dressing room. The tables have been turned now. How will the hosts' batsmen cope against Johnson, Harris and Siddle? Harris to Rudolph, OUT cleaned him up! Harris goes straight through Rudolph's defence and uproots off stump. The ball pitched on a good length and bent back in ever so slightly after angling across the left-hander. Rudolph played outside the line from his crease and was beaten b Watson to Amla, OUT Lbw! Watson nips the ball into Amla and hits the pad, loud appeal for lbw follows and the umpire says not out. Clarke asks for a review. The ball pitched just outside off and swung in to hit the pad on the top part of the knee roll. Replays indicate the ball Watson to Kallis, OUT has Watson got another one? Kallis tries to pull a short ball but doesn't make proper contact, the ball lobs off something and is caught by Ponting second slip. The Australians are convinced it's off the bat. Kallis is not going anywhere and the umpire Ian Harris to de Villiers, OUT (18.1) Another referral! Looks like an optimistic one, but there's no stopping the Aussies from signalling the 'T' now. Was it pad first? Harris nips one in from a length outside off, as AB pushes forward with bat and pad close together ... I tell you Watson to Boucher, OUT given lbw! Watson has five, or does he? Boucher's reviewed it this time. That pitched just outside off stump and angled into Boucher, who tries to defend on the back foot. He misses and the ball crashes into the top of his back pad. Watson is dead sure, a Harris to Philander, OUT caught at slip! The collapse continues. Philander tries to drive a good length ball on the up without really moving his feet.

If Australia thought their Cape Town experience could not get any worse after they were dismissed for 47 on the second afternoon, they were badly mistaken, with Smith and Amla adding to the hurt for the visitors. The winning runs came when Smith, who finished unbeaten on 101, clipped Peter Siddle through midwicket and South African fans jumped to their feet to celebrate a famous victory. This was a team that on the second day had been bowled out for 96. In doing so, South Africa became just the second team in 60 years to win a Test having been bowled out for less than 100 in their first innings; the only other occasion in the modern era was New Zealand's success against India in Wellington in 2002."

Johnson to Elgar, OUT full and striahgt, gets the ball to move back sharply and hits Elgar in line of off-stump, good fighting innings comes to an end. Johnson to Behardien, OUT carbon-copy of Elgar's dismissal, might have pitched on the line of leg-stump, but seemed quite close from up here in line with the pitch, but the umpire says it's gone. Well bowled by Johnson beating Behardien with Johnson to Peterson, OUT shortish delivery, doesn't bounce all that much and baffles Peterson as he plays all over it, gets an inside edge onto his stumps. Siddle to Parnell, OUT shortish delivery just on the line of off-stump, snick tyhrough to the skipper at second slip who takes a good catch. Johnson to Philander, 1 leg bye leg-bye down leg after rapping the pads Philander to Ponting, OUT full and straight this time, Ponting plays down the wrong line and is trapped right in front, doesn't seem too happy with the decision, but he has to go. Australia in trouble here. de Lange to Johnson, OUT first-baller for Johnson! Full and straight and De Lange gets a decent ammount of in-swing, Johnson goes across the line and is trapped in front, excellent session for the South Africans so far. Australia are 7 down, de Lange to Siddle, 1 wide poor delivery for a hat-trick ball, bouncer going over the head of Siddle. de Lange to Siddle, OUT short and straight once more, gets decent bounce and the ball hits Siddle on the shoulder of the bat, the ball pops up and flies straight to Behardien at gully once again, easy catch, soft dismissal. de Lange to Copeland, OUT and De Lange gets his fifth, what a special day for the 21-year old. Gets copeland the get an edge of his short delivery and Tsolekile takes a good catch down leg. Australia are nine down. De Lange leads the team of the field to a resounding cheer, receives the innings-ball from the umpires as well to keep. Excellent bowling from the young man picking up five and tearing thorugh the Aussie middle-order after getting Marsh as well. Innings Start Watson to face the first ball and Hughes the non-striker.","Australians 236 and 214 for 3 (Watson 77, Marsh 73*) beat South Africa A 183 and 264 (Peterson 103, Tsolekile 58, Johnson 5-74) by seven wickets Scorecard The Australians won their tour match in Potchefstroom with four sessions to spare but ticked most of the boxes they wanted to tick ahead of next week's first Test. Another day's play could have been a useful tune-up before the team heads to Cape Town, but there were only a few men who failed to make the most of the game. Mitchell Johnson showed signs of his best form with a nine-wicket match-haul, Shane Watson muscled his way to 77 in the second innings, Shaun Marsh scored a pair of half-centuries, Peter Siddle made a strong case for Test selection, Michael Clarke was fluent in his first-innings 76 and Nathan Lyon improved as the match went on. But Phillip Hughes and Ricky Ponting would have wanted more time in the middle and Trent Copeland's lack of penetration may have put him in danger of losing his spot. However, a seven-wicket victory was an encouraging result for the Australians, who were set 212 to win on the third day, after Johnson's five-wicket haul in the second innings, and they got there with ease."
"Toss: Australia win a tricky toss and bat first on a green wicket. India are playing Kohli, Ashwin and Umesh Yadav, as expected. If you didn't know the Australia XI already, its time to come out from under that rock. People are still streaming in, and it won't be long before MCG is packed. Khan to Warner, 1 leg bye bit of extra lift on a length ball that shaped in towards the hips. Warner skips inside the line and fends it off the hips behind square for one legbye. Yadav to Warner, OUT didn't take long coming, that wicket, after the break. Yadav's sent Warner on his way. This was a set-up, and Warner couldn't resist. Square leg went back, suggesting there could be a bumper round the corner. It came immediately, it was quite pacy, it wasn't outside off like the la Ashwin to Lyon, OUT Ashwin's bowled Lyon round the legs and Australia are bowled out. Quite a strange dismissal. It was fired in full on off stump, Lyon got drastically across and looked to sweep. He missed, and Ashwin pegged back off stump. All out for 333, triple Nelson ends the innings. Hilfenhaus to Gambhir, OUT heat at one end, the wicket comes at the other. Gambhir once again perishes to an indiscretion outside the off stump. Top bowling from Hilfenhaus, but aided by an average shot too. Short of a length, at least a foot and a half outside off stump to start with. The ball then sea Pattinson to Dravid, 1 wide over-cooked bouncer, too short as Dravid ducks under, and it is called a wide. Siddle to Tendulkar, OUT Siddle's done it! Is this a no-ball? No! Tendulkar's been bowled through the gate, still on 99. Top length that, at blistering pace. Tendulkar got on the front foot, but he wasn't going to reach the length of the ball. That swerved in late, was it reverse? Sachin tried to punch Hilfenhaus to Dravid, OUT he's bowled 'em! what a ball to get early in the morning, as straight as you can get, fullish length, bang on off stump, straightens enough to sneak past Dravid's push and rattles the off stump, just the start Australia wanted, so they have got the two big wickets in consecuti Siddle to Laxman, OUT there's the edge, and Laxman is gone, the fuller length working perfectly for Australia this morning, pitched up just outside off, Laxman comes forward, not exactly fully, and there is enough away shape there to take the edge, the ball is dying on Haddin, but he tumbles forward to Hilfenhaus to Kohli, OUT they won't need the new ball for Virat, he is gone, all the batsmen have fallen today to the pitched up ball which moves away slightly, Kohli is forward in defence, but the movement has done him, and the outside edge is snapped up easily by Haddin Hilfenhaus to Dhoni, OUT oh well, that was on the cards, Dhoni has a go, and gives gully catching practice, Hilfenhaus shifted the angle to just outside off stump, the length was not as full, Dhoni went after it anyway, not too hard though, and the edge looped slowly straight to gully, Hilfenhaus has h Hilfenhaus to Sharma, OUT Hilfenhaus has five, his first one in Tests, he holds his arms aloft and smiles widely, Ishant goes for an uncharacteristic big drive at the pitched up ball and gets a big edge through to Haddin, who has been busy this morning, superb spell from Hilfenhaus today, been too good Pattinson to Ashwin, SIX runs eep, how has that gone for six, Ashwin got well across and swung at this shortish delivery, he was of course looking to go square on the leg side, it instead goes way over Haddin and the slips, and carries all the way! Incredible Lunch India have lost 8 for 68 to concede a lead of 51. After stumps yesterday, Australia would have been thinking of how to contain India. The visitors have instead crumbled in a heap against some disciplined fast bowling to surrender the advantage completely.

James Pattinson, Ben Hilfenhaus and Peter Siddle made a fearful mess of India's batting, sharing nine wickets between them to bring a swift conclusion to a match that had fluctuated often over the course of the previous three days. In doing so they finished with the ball what had started with the bat - Australia's tail deflated India in the morning by stretching the target to 292. Pattinson's contribution on his home ground was telling, first stroking an unbeaten 37 then firing out Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman while also softening up Sachin Tendulkar for Siddle, who claimed him with his first ball after relieving the younger Victorian. The end arrived 70 minutes after tea, Australia claiming a 1-0 series lead in their quest to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and decided to field. Not surprising, given the greenish shade on the pitch. Australia are fielding an unchanged side. Big blow to New Zealand. Daniel Vettori isn't playing, he's been replaced by left-arm seamer Trent Boult, who'll be making his international debut. It appears Vettori has a muscle strain, his absence weakens New Zealand significantly. Will confirm the exact Pattinson to McCullum, 4 leg byes struck him hard on the shoulders as McCullum was trying to evade that, banged in short on leg stump and McCullum tried to get out of the way, the deflection off the shoulder took it to the fine-leg boundary Siddle to Guptill, OUT Siddle strikes! What a beauty! Just the right amount of movement, a hint of away movement after pitching on a good length on middle, Guptill played inside the line to that one, driving forward and nicked it straight to the keeper Pattinson to Ryder, OUT appeal for lbw, Clarke has called for a review, swung in and rapped Ryder on the pads near leg stump, the bat made contact with the pad as Ryder was trying to close the face on that fullish delivery. Hot Spot left the mark but to me it seems it was the bat making contact with the pad and not the inside edge but it's what the umpire thinks that counts. Ball-tracking shows the im Pattinson to Taylor, (no ball) this one is fired down the leg side and moved way further down, it was also a no-ball, the wicketkeeper had no chance Siddle to McCullum, 1 leg bye will be happy to get off strike, turned the face on that straightish delivery to pick a single past short leg Siddle to Taylor, OUT Siddle strikes again, the umpire gives it out and Taylor calls for the review. Landed on a good length outside off stump and nipped back in sharply, Taylor didn't read it well, opted to leave and was struck on the pads, the umpire gave it out immediately once the appeal was made but Taylor wasn't convinced. Called for a review, thinking it may have gone over the stumps but ball-t Starc to Williamson, OUT caught-behind, caught down the leg side, a fortunate breakthrough for Starc, clear impact with the bat, down the leg side and Williamson chased it, trying to glance it down to the fine-leg boundary, made contact but it wasn't far enough from Haddin who dived to his left to complete a good catch, four down now Pattinson to McCullum, OUT McCullum has to go, Australia completely on top now, couldn't resist poking at a full, swinging, tempting delivery outside off that nipped away, it drew him into playing a shot and he got a faint nick straight to Haddin. All that patience and restraint and steel he'd displayed to get his far has been washed away Pattinson to Young, OUT bowled'im! Young departs, angled in and then moved away and Young was shaping to leave that one alone after it pitched but ended up chopping it on just as he was doing it, six down and New Zealand are in tatters Pattinson to Brownlie, 1 leg bye tried to glance that one down, was down the leg side again, got a leg-bye as it deflected off the pads Siddle to Bracewell, OUT Siddle strikes again, another promising stand broken, Bracewell had hung in at one end, supporting his more fluent partner, but was tempted into driving at a perfectly pitched-up delivery outside off that moved away, got a healthy edge straight to Clarke at first slip Siddle to Southee, 1 leg bye managed to keep that short ball down, went off the thigh, past a diving short leg, for a leg-bye into the leg side Starc to Southee, 1 leg bye tries to turn it away past short leg, gets a single as it deflects off the pads Starc to Southee, OUT Brownlie's stranded, Southee chases a wide delivery from Starc, aiming to strike that through cover and drags it onto the stumps. That's two lower-order partnerships that showed some mettle, only to be cut short by avoidable shots Pattinson to Brownlie, OUT Oh dear, Brownlie's chopped it on, short ball and he's cut well so far this innings, it's something you'd back him pull off but this one nipped in slightly and he got an inside edge onto the stumps as he was targeting the point region, the end of a very good innings that promised much more Pattinson to Martin, OUT Five for Pattinson, Martin goes first ball! Nipped back in from a good length and Martin had no answers to that, was bowled through the gate Successive five-wicket hauls for Pattinson, New Zealand have been bundled out for 150. The sun is hiding behind the clouds again, Phil Hughes is under pressure. New Zealand have a chance to fight back. But they could have done with a better batting performance. The conditions were tough to bat in, but they certainly merited a score more than 150. McCullum and Williamson, Brownlie and Bracewell, Brownlie and Play is set to resume now. The Australian openers are out in the middle. Martin to start. Three slips, two gullys and Warner's on strike Martin to Hughes, OUT Martin strikes! Hughes is caught in the slips once again, the pressure on him grows, lovely delivery in the channel outside off, shaping away from the left-hander, leant forward to defend and it took the outside edge as it moved away, Guptill made no mistake at second slip. Tried to defend there with a slightly open face did Hughes Southee to Ponting, OUT Ponting walked even before he was given out! He knew he was gone, landed on a good length on the off and moved back in further, Ponting had moved across and was caught in several minds about what to do with it, whether to play it to mid-on, or midwicket or squarer or leave it and in the end he didn't do any, was too late in bringing his bat down and by the time he did, the bal Boult to Hussey, OUT Maiden Test wicket for Boult, was not flustered by the pull the previous ball, short of a good length this time just on the off stump and got it to nip away, Hussey was looking to leave that one but that decision came a little late and feathered it to the wicketkeeper just as he was about to shoulder arms, Young was alert and dived foward and low to take a good catch Bracewell to Siddle, 1 leg bye sliding it on the pads, gets a leg-bye behind square for a single Bracewell to Clarke, OUT Rewind to Ashes 2005, Simon Jones to Clarke at Old Trafford. The only difference is that that it was reverse-swing that had a hand in the dismissal then. In this case, it was some inward movement off the pitch and a big misjudgement on the part of Clarke, landed short of a good length outside off and nipped in and he left that be, not expecting it to dart back in.

The hosts' chase of 241 had been guided expertly by David Warner, but Bracewell's removal of Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey, all on 159, left Australia a nervous 5 for 173 at lunch, and on resumption the remaining five went down for a mere 60. In all it was a collapse of 8 for 74, Warner left marooned on 123 when the last man, Nathan Lyon, was bowled by Bracewell. Bracewell's display, characterised by swing, bounce and sharp variation, confirmed his pre-series billing by the New Zealand captain Ross Taylor as a cricketer of enormous potential. It also branded Australia as a team of profound vulnerability with the bat, a problem made doubly vexing by the fact the top seven is populated as much by experience as callow youth."
"6.42pm India win the toss and choose to bowl Sundar to Finch, OUT a miscue to mid off! Back of a length on off, he went back and tried to flat back it over mid off but he completely miscued and lobbed a catch to Pandya on the circle at mid off. Simple catch Sundar to Wade, 1 leg bye he's hit on the pad sweeping but it pitched way outside leg, they pinch a leg bye Chahar to Wade, 1 wide short bouncer that gets away from him and it's way too wide and short Sundar to Smith, OUT clean bowled! Rahul is relieved! Lovely delivery. Tossed higher and slower outside off, Smith gives room to try and loft to the short boundary at cover, he is deceived in flight and it clips the top of off. Chahal to Maxwell, (no ball) Rahul makes no mistake this time as he tracks down this skier. Chahal shifts his line wider once again, hits a heavy length. Maxwell aims to haul it over midwicket. He can only top-edge it to Rahul. Okay, hang on, Chahal has overstepped Thakur to Wade, SIX runs Thankur ventures an offcutter, puts it on a length and outside off. Wade picks it up, opens up his hips and hauls it over wide long-on. Muscled away Chahal to Maxwell, 1 wide off-wide wide Thakur to Wade, OUT slower dipper from Thakur and Wade has been given out lbw. The batsman sweeps early, the ball plunges sharply and hits him on the boot in line with the stumps. Wade has reviewed almost immediately. Has he nicked it then? Nope, and ball-tracking returns three reads. Wade goes for a career-best 80 off 53 balls Natarajan to Maxwell, OUT Natarajan aims for the yorker, but it comes out as a full-toss. Maxwell shuffles across, looks to reverse-swat it away, but misses it altogether in the end. Natarajan messes with the stumps once again Glenn Maxwell will bowl the first over. Around the wicket.

Iyer has been given out lbw, he chats to his captain and asks for a review. Wrong'un from Swepson, Iyer inches forward and does not read it, pushing outside the line of it. Did he nick it? Nope, and it's clipping top of leg stump. Swepson finishes with 3 for 23 in four overs. Will it turn out to be a match-winning spell?

"Siddle to Young, OUT and that's the end of that. Young's come and gone in a flash. Siddle continues to hit that lovely length outside off and seam it away. This time Young jabs at it with hard hands and it has the legs to carry easily into Clarke's hands in the slips. Lyon to Bracewell, OUT how well has Lyon bowled on his first trip to this ground? Bracewell is gone, playing for the spin against a deceptive over-spinner and that's an 18-ball duck. Lyon tossed this up outside off and it goes on straight to skim the outside edge, straight into first slip's hand. Starc to Southee, SIX runs Southee's killed that! That's the batsman's version of the round-house kick. Pitched up outside off, he plants the front foot towards the length and hoicks it right back past the bowler and all the way into the stands. Lyon to Southee, OUT and that's the end of Southee's hand. He skates out again and looks to take Lyon downtown, but mishits the loft. Hussey comes in from long-on on gobbles it.

Having bowled out Pakistan for 212, Australia were made to fight every inch for the two-wicket win that handed Pakistan their second 5-0 sweep in history. Fittingly, it was Michael Hussey, Australia's most valuable player for a scrap, who steered them home with an unbeaten 40.

Join us in half an hour to see how Pakistan do with the chase Harris to Iftikhar, OUT Ten wickets in two matches for Harris, and has he worked this one out beautifully or what? Four short deliveries, tucking him up, getting a short leg in, keeping him in the crease, and then sucker punch, full and wide, and the edge flies to right of Haddin who dives and takes it single-handed.

Michael Hussey and Nathan Hauritz starred with the bat, before Ryan Harris tore through the batting with a second successive five-for to set up a crushing 135-run win. Remarkably, given how poor Pakistan have been in this country, this was Australia's first win over them in an ODI in Perth. Pakistan's tour has been one long, dark and miserable spiral since the fourth day of the second Test in Sydney and it continued with another dispirited, stuttering performance. They did battle in the field but let Australia get away at a critical stage once again, and contrasting fifties from Michael Hussey and Nathan Hauritz then took them to 277."

It might have too, but i Ajmal to Marsh, OUT superb bowling, follows that quicker delivery with a nicely flighted, inviting offbreak outside off, Marsh is drawn out of the crease, as if pulled by a string, and then the ball bounces away from his reach and spins away, beating him, and Taufel doesn't even need to go Naved-ul-Hasan to White, OUT lovely legcutter, yanks the wrist at the point of delivery, pitches off, back of a length, moves away a touch, squares him up, takes the outside edge, and White has to go - this should delay the Powerplay further Umar Gul to Hussey, OUT Hussey misses 50, looks to walk down the pitch to alter the length, gets too much under a low fulltoss, and they have protection down at long-off where Younis makes no mistake Umar Gul to Clarke, OUT he is on a hat-trick, would you believe it?

Haddin takes a nice overhead catch, one-handed, full stretch, lovely to watch Bollinger to Umar Akmal, 1 wide bouncer, too high, easily ducks under it McKay to Umar Akmal, 1 wide digs this one in short, down the leg side Harris to Afridi, 1 leg bye seams in again, gets a leg-bye Clarke to Afridi, 1 run not looking for the six here, paddles it smartly for a single McKay to Fawad Alam, OUT and finally his shuffle is breached, the shuffle always leaves him exposed to a sharp incoming delivery, and perhaps for the first time tonight, Australia bowl one such delivery to Fawad, and the inside edge cannons into the middle stump Player of the match is Ryan Harris, AUS","Australia 6 for 286 (Marsh 83, Clarke 80, Hussey 49) beat Pakistan 246 (Umar Akmal 59, Harris 5-43, McKay 3-48) by 40 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Ryan Harris was the star for Australia with five wickets in his second ODI Getty Images In his second one-day international, Ryan Harris kept a cool head under pressure to deliver Australia a 40-run victory and an unassailable 3-0 series lead after Shahid Afridi lit up a match that had threatened to fizzle out. Workmanlike half-centuries from Shaun Marsh and Michael Clarke, and a late Michael Hussey blitz, set up Australia's 6 for 286 before Harris grabbed 5 for 43 to confirm Australia's win. It was a remarkable effort from Harris, who finished up as the Man of the Match having only been called into the squad late on match eve as cover for Peter Siddle, who had a sore back. He began with a wicket in his first over and returned with three in two overs during the batting Powerplay when Afridi and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan were giving Pakistan hope of a famous fightback. They had taken 37 from the first three overs of the field restrictions."
"1405 Mohammad Yousuf has won the toss and put Australia in on a day that an odd shower is expected in Sydney. Australia go in with the same XI that took a 1-0 lead in Brisbane. Pakistan, yet to win a thing on the tour, bring in Umar Gul for Mohammad Asif. Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the second O Amir to Watson, 1 wide he is going for everything here, short and wide, angling away, and he throws the kitchen sink at it and misses, all fielders safe too Amir to Watson, 1 bye good sharp bouncer, 143ks, rising as Watson sways put of the way, rising even more by the time it reaches Kamran who jumps high and gets a hand to it, but can't prevent a bye Afridi to Watson, OUT so the pressure put in by the spinners has worked, throws this one up gently after having pinned him on the back foot, Watson goes for the flick-sweep, not the all-out powerful shot, just the flick-sweep, but he has times it too well, and it carries to deep square leg where Malik Afridi to Marsh, OUT Afridi gets two! looks for the chip over the on side, the bat face turns early, the leading edge carries all the way to long-on, and Afridi is in his Flintoffesque celebration, arms aloft, letting the mates surround him and hug him Amir to Ponting, OUT it was on the cards, looks to loft him over mid-on, is half a second early into the shot, and ends up lobbing it straight to Yousuf at mid-on. Aamer is ecstatic, Ponting is furious We are back with Pakistan's reply. The momentum is with them after they contained Australia after a rollicking start. This is a good batting wicket with true bounce. Salman Butt will face Doug Bollinger to start it off. Two slips in place. Siddle to Kamran, 1 wide big shout for catch down the leg side, but it clips the thigh on the way - Asoka de Silva misses the connection and calls it a wide Bollinger to Younis, OUT beautiful bowling, lands around middle and off, seams away, Younis is drawn into the drive, gets a healthy edge, White dives to his left, in front of the first slip, and takes the catch. Superb catch, but would have been easier for the first slip Bollinger to Mohammad Yousuf, 1 wide wide down the leg side, the short one goes wrong McKay to Mohammad Yousuf, OUT superb bowling followed by superb fielding from McKay! tucks Yousuf up, Akmal wants a leg-bye, but it's not gone far off, and Yousuf correctly sends him back. McKay makes a dash, turns around, and thrown the middle stump down on a half-volley. The way Akmal has been gettin McKay to Malik, 1 wide spoils a good over by angling this one too far down the leg side McKay to Malik, OUT Ponting pulls off a blinder at point, Malik makes room and cuts, dying on him, Ponting dives to his left, gets his left hand between the ball and the ground, smoothly done. There was no rush, no hurry, as he dived, as if he had sized that up all along, and that while diving full len McKay to Mohammad Yousuf, 1 wide angled too far down the leg side Hauritz to Afridi, SIX runs And he has hit him 30 rows back here, over long-on, what a hit, jumps out of the crease, Hauritz bowls flat, and that is playing into Afridi's hands Watson to Afridi, OUT out goes Afridi, short ball, Afridi looks for a repeat of his previous hit over long-on, there is no room for him and he top-edges into the orbit, Watson tells Haddin he wants the caught-and-bowled, gets under it, and as Bob Willis would say, makes no mistake Hauritz to Naved-ul-Hasan, OUT and he's a goner, superb stumping by Haddin, tosses this up, teasing him, and Rana is beaten in the flight, the ball turns sharply down the leg side and Haddin is super-quick, although off balance because of the sharp turn So a superb performance by Australia to a 2-0 lead. While Pakistan made their way back from the Watson storm at the top of the Aussie innings, there was no way back after Bollinger and Siddle blew them away with their pace and bounce. It was indeed a joy to watch them bowl consistently in the high 140s - Sidd Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 6 for 267 (Watson 69, White 55, Aamer 3-53) beat Pakistan 127 (Yousuf 58, McKay 3-15) by 140 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Cameron White scored 55 and took two catches as Pakistan were over-run at the SCG Getty Images Australia produced a commanding all-round performance to take a 2-0 lead with a 140-run demolition of Pakistan at the SCG. After being led by Shane Watson and Cameron White in their 6 for 267, the hosts delivered a stinging bowling display to knock over the tourists for 127 in 37.3 overs. Pakistan lost their first five wickets for 42 in an awful opening and the result added further to the troubles of the captain Mohammad Yousuf, who is being replaced after the series. Yousuf had mistakenly chosen to bowl first in the hope of getting an advantage from the overcast conditions in the afternoon, but all the support came for the fast men as the sun started to go down."
"Daniel Vettori has won the toss and will bat first again. In team news, Tim Southee comes in for Daryl Tuffey, which is a slight surprise. Tait to Ingram, OUT 151 kph, good length from Tait, Ingram plays down the wrong line and is bowled! It just didn't seem as if he picked that one up - or any of the three... Nannes to McCullum, SIX runs full on off stump and McCullum hits nicely through the line over extra cover for four Nannes to McCullum, 1 leg bye 132 kph, slower ball at leg stump and McCullum clips it to short fine leg Nannes to McCullum, SIX runs full outside off and McCullum slog sweeps it high over mid wicket for half a dozen. McCullum on fire! Nannes to McCullum, 1 leg bye good length but too straight and it takes McCullum on the thigh and into the leg side Harris to Guptill, OUT good length, a fraction straight and Guptill drives in the air, he actually hits it too well and goes straight down the throat of Smith at long on Smith to Taylor, OUT Taylor cuts to White again and he calls yes but McCullum sends him back and he's found short by a good throw Smith to Franklin, OUT half volley driven straight to Clarke at mid wicket. The Australian captain made sure he watched that all the way into his hands after dropping a catch in Wellington. No mistake this time Christian to Hopkins, SIX runs low full toss, Hopkins uses depth of the crease and whips it low over square leg for a maximum. Hopkins' innovation at his best Harris to McCullum, 1 wide McCullum moves inside the line and leaves as it's wide of off stump. It was actually inside the line but harshly called wide Nannes to Hopkins, OUT bumper from Nannes and Hopkins goes back and hooks off the top edge over the keeper for four but he's walked back onto his stumps. Disappointing end to a superb knock from the wee man Nannes to McCullum, SIX runs bumper again and McCullum hooks high into the stands for a maximum! Tait to Oram, OUT Oram walks across to the off side and misses it and is cleaned out. Great delivery from the express paceman Harris to McCullum, SIX runs short and pulled powerfully flat into the stands for half a dozen Tait to McCullum, SIX runs McCullum falls away to the off side and plays a miraculous scoop over the keepers' head for six! Tait to McCullum, 2 wide this is well wide of off stump, Nathan plays and misses and they steal a bye too, he's overstepped again Tait to McCullum, 1 leg bye he steps away to leg and plays to thid man off his back pad Southee to Warner, SIX runs half volley and Warner lays into it, times is beautifully over long off for six Vettori to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin walks across his stumps and picks it up from off stump and drop kicks it over square leg for six Franklin to Clarke, 1 leg bye gives himself room and tries to play through the off side but it takes him on the hip and drops into the leg side Vettori to White, SIX runs gives himself room and launches half a dozen over extra cover, what a stroke Franklin to White, SIX runs Franklin bowls a decent length but White just leans back and heaves it over long off for six more. This kid can really play Oram to White, 1 wide yorker length but well wide off off stump Right, buckle up for the Super Over. The team chasing will bat first, so White won't have to take his pads off. Australia's three batsmen are White, Warner and Haddin. If they lose two wickets, that's the end of the Super Over innings. Match tied (New Zealand won the one-over eliminator) Player of the match is Brendon McCullum, NZ","New Zealand 214 for 6 (McCullum 116*) tied with Australia 214 for 4 (Clarke 67, White 64*). New Zealand won after Super Over Scorecard and ball-by-ball details McScoop Master: Brendon McCullum's unbeaten 116 included bouts of brave brilliance Getty Images A superb match needed a Super Over to split the teams and New Zealand prevailed to repay Brendon McCullum for his amazing century. McCullum became the second-highest scorer in a Twenty20 international with an unbeaten 116, but after Michael Clarke and Cameron White exploded in the reply the scores were tied at 214 after 40 overs. A six-ball tiebreaker was required and the calm Tim Southee delivered another tight over to allow only six runs for White, David Warner and Brad Haddin. Shaun Tait's waywardness, including two wides, assisted the locals and Martin Guptill finished the game with a four over point from the third legitimate delivery."
"Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of Australia's tour of New Zealand, which begins with today's Twenty20 in Wellington. The news at the Westpac Stadium is that Daniel Vettori has won the toss and New Zealand will bat. Tait to McCullum, OUT This one is quick again and McCullum pushes away from his body and it takes the outside edge and Haddin takes a remarkable catch diving full stretch to his right, snaring the ball in one hand. What a start! Johnson to Ingram, OUT 143 kph, great start from Johnson as he bowls back of a length and Ingram plays all around it trying to work it through the leg side and it takes out middle stump Johnson to Taylor, OUT Taylor walks across to the off side and looks to heave it over mid wicket but he misses and it takes him on his back foot outside the line of off stump and he's given out LBW. The hosts certainly didn't need that and Australia are Johnson to Guptill, OUT short and Guptill pulls into mid wicket where Watson moves back from mid wicket and takes the catch half-way between the boundary and the 30m circle Nannes to Oram, OUT short and angled at the body and Oram pulls to mid wicket where Watson dives full stretch to his right and pulls of a superb one handed grab! Nannes to McCullum, OUT good length from Nannes, McCullum tries to pull, it takes him high on the bat and it loops to Hussey at mid on Christian to Franklin, SIX runs half volley on leg stump and Franklin helps it on its way over square leg for half a dozen Tait to Vettori, 1 bye good length beats Vettori for pace and it goes over the top of middle stump and Haddin can't glove it cleanly Tait to Franklin, OUT full delivery and Franklin drives down the ground in the air, he mistimes it and Smith dives forward to his left at mid off to take a good catch Watson to Tuffey, OUT Tuffey swings hard again and misses, Vettori calls him through for a bye, Haddin rolls to collect the ball as it bounces in front of him and he throws down the stumps in the same motion. Superb work from the keeper! Watson to Tuffey, OUT Tuffey moves across to outside off stump and it takes him on the thigh pad and Haddin collects it and half-appeals and umpire Baxter gives it out! Unlucky for Tuffey there Mitchell Johnson is named Man of the Match for his three for 19 off four overs. He picked up the wickets of Ingram, Taylor and Guptill which dented any momentum New Zealand would've hoped for up front. New Zealand were undone by the pace of Tait, Nannes and Johnson atth top of the innings and were chasing their tails as a result for the rest of the innings, eventually being bowled out for 118 from the final ball fo the innings. David Hussey is happy with his team's effort and enjoyed the pace in the wicket which allowed him to score 46 off 36 balls. He hit nicely over the top straight down the ground and pulled strongly whenever the bowlers dropped short. Australia just far too good for New Zealand tonight, winning by six wickets with 24 balls to spare.

After an unbeaten home summer the visitors started their tour with another convincing display built on very fast bowling and powerful opening batting. New Zealand were knocked over for 118 by the speed of Shaun Tait, Dirk Nannes and Mitchell Johnson and their chances of defending the small total were basically extinguished as soon as David Warner and Shane Watson blasted 28 from the first two overs. The openers were dismissed quickly and Johnson's promotion to No. 4 failed, dropping the visitors to 39 for 3, but the small target allowed them to take their time and the win came with 24 balls to spare."
"Sundar to Wade, 1 leg bye 94kph, angled into leg, back of a length, it comes off the thigh guard and rolls fine for a leg bye Natarajan to Short, OUT Great catch by Iyer at deep forward square. This was a head high short ball, D'Arcy Short pulled flat and hard, he nailed it, but hit it straight to the man and Iyer had to back track a touch, jump up and take the catch above his head. Good catch Natarajan to Henriques, OUT Henriques reviews a catch behind. Given very late by the umpire, presumably because India were celebrating before they appealed. It's a cutter in the corridor. He was looking to slap that over the leg side. There's nothing on the thermal images, but Snicko has a murmur as the ball is adjacent to the bat. The decision will be upheld 9.05pm The players are about to head back out to the middle. Matthew Wade leads Australia out. Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul head out to the middle. Daniel Sams has the new ball on debut. He played with Dhawan at Delhi Capitals and bowled to KL Rahul in the IPL. Slip in for Rahul Tye to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye an appeal for lbw given not out. Wade says it's worth a look. Tye was unsure. But Wade reviews. He was hit on the back leg trying to flick over square. No bat. It was pitching outside leg. It was very tight. Part of the ball was in line but not enough. That's why Tye wasn't interested. Australia lose the review. Tye to Rahul, (no ball) he over-steps. It was a good length outside off and Rahul missed trying to heave over midwicket Tye to Rahul, SIX runs launched over cover! What a shot. Full outside off, he set himself and crushed it over the long boundary at cover. That was in the slot Zampa to Kohli, SIX runs just, how? Good length, beats him in flight, grips and turns, He's stepped out to play the lofted drive, he checks it at the last moment, but has got it to sweeper's right from an almost back foot position Tye to Kohli, 1 wide slower ball at a length and very wide outside off 11:08pm And that is all from our coverage of the second match. Good night, and catch you soon!

ALSO WATCH: Match highlights - Natarajan, Hardik seal series for India (India subcontinent only) The Australians were led by Matthew Wade in the absence of Aaron Finch due to injury, and he led from the front with a swift half-century at the top of the order. But the remainder of the Australian innings was spasmodic, and without any of Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood or Mitchell Starc, the bowling attack was well and truly below the usual level of expertise. Kohli, KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan ensured India would be in the contest until its closing passages, whereupon Pandya lined up his scoring zones with brutal efficiency. Daniel Sams was defending 14 from the final over, but with a pair of towering blows beyond the straight midwicket boundary, India claimed the series with two balls to spare."
"Hello and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second Twenty20 international between West Indies and Australia being played in Sydney. West Indies have won the toss and opted to bat in a game they need to win to deprive Australia of an unbeaten summer. We'll get you the teams in a bit; in the meantime, do Harris to Gayle, 1 wide starts with a wide, slides it down the leg side, false start Tait to Gayle, 1 wide short down the leg side, tries to whip it past fine leg, doesn't get his bat to it, bowled at a fiery pace, 152.6 kmph Harris to Morton, OUT gone! Bowls it on a length outside off, tries to drive it through the line, gets a thick outside edge and Cameron White at second slip makes no mistake, a first-ball duck for Morton Tait to Ramdin, OUT short and wide, makes room to cut that over third man but can't find enough to beat him, got plenty of elevation and Warner ran forward to complete a sharp catch Johnson to Dowlin, 1 wide short of a good length outside off, too wide, tries his best to reach it but can't Watson to Pollard, OUT Pollard's gone, a wild swing to a ball bowled on a good length on the off, misses and the off stump is pegged back, a big blow for West Indies Roach to Warner, SIX runs another one, took his hands off after pulling it behind square, had enough on it to take it past the ropes behind fine leg, came on to him a little too quickly but he got into position early Smith to Warner, 1 wide wide, short, too wide, lots of open spaces in the leg side and he slips it wide of off, given Smith to Warner, SIX runs Smith's turn now, slower one bowled short outside off, a long hop, pulled away for the umpteenth time into the stands, well taken in the crowd A ruthless batting display from Australia has won them this game with 50 balls to spare.

Warner raced to fifty from 18 deliveries, beating his own 19-ball effort from last season, as Australia reeled in the target of 139 with a ridiculous 50 deliveries to spare. West Indies' total looked semi-competitive until the first over of the chase when Warner and Shane Watson took 26 off Kemar Roach, who bowled too short and allowed Warner to swing through midwicket. There were three sixes in the over - as many as the visitors hit in their entire innings - and the contest was all but decided. By the time Warner had cleared the boundary off Darren Sammy in the second over, he had 33 from eight deliveries and Yuvraj Singh's 12-ball half-century record was conceivably in danger."
"Hello and welcome to the first of two Twenty20s between Australia and West Indies. The hosts have won the toss and will bat. Gayle to Watson, OUT gets him, finally! Gave it some air this time, tossed up on middle, tried to dispatch it into the stands over deep midwicket, got the top edge and Ramdin, after waiting ages for it to come down, clasped it easily Smith to Warner, OUT full toss on middle, he could have smacked it anywhere but instead played it back straight to the bowler who accepted it gleefully Gayle to Hussey, OUT three down, cleanly struck but hit flat, came down the track and smacked it hard but straight to Roach at long-off who did well moving to his right and holding on to a sharp one Pollard to Clarke, OUT four down, Miller takes a sharp one at point, short and wide, cut away hard and he hurls himself to his right to snap an excellent catch Miller to Birt, OUT stumped, Miller bowled it flat outside off, Birt came down the track and tried to push it on the off side, missed and Ramnarine did the rest Smith to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin continues to punish, picked it off a length and swung it over wide long-on for another six Smith to Smith, OUT caught-behind, off the reverse paddle, full outside off, tries to play it towards third man, gets a faint touch and Ramdin makes no mistake Tait to Gayle, 1 wide short outside leg stump, tries to help it on its way to the fine-leg boundary, misses, gets a wide Nannes to Simmons, OUT another one goes, Tait again in action, bowls it on a good length on middle and off and Simmons has a mindless, needless swipe at it, ends up miscuing it to third man where Tait takes a well-judged catch Nannes to Morton, 1 wide too high a bouncer, that. Working up some good pace, almost hitting 150, but it's given a wide Nannes to Morton, OUT Steve Smith takes another beauty! Even better than the first one, bowled it on a good length on the off, Morton swung it hard and connected well but Smith was there waiting, it appeared as though it would clear him but he timed his jump perf Australia have won this comfortably, though had West Indies prevented that horrendous start to their chase, we would have had a more competitive match.

Warner provided the early thrills with a brutal batting display before the Man of the Match Tait destroyed West Indies' top order as Australia's plans for the ICC World Twenty20 took a step in the right direction. Warner and Shane Watson lit up Bellerive Oval, which was hosting its first night international, by taking Australia to 0 for 83 in the eighth over and some late fireworks from Brad Haddin pushed them to 8 for 179. It was a good but gettable total, until two wickets in Tait's first over knocked the life out of the chase. Chris Gayle has failed to spark during the limited-overs portion of the summer and that trend continued when he swung wildly at Tait's fourth delivery and saw his stumps splayed."

"1.30pm: Good day and welcome to Cricinfo's coverage of the second ODI between Australia and West Indies in Adelaide. The early news is that Chris Gayle has won the toss again and this time he has decided to bat. He had put Australia in at the MCG ... Bollinger to Gayle, OUT ball 1 strike 1! Right on target is Doug Bollinger, gets some late movement inwards and the ball straightens, lands on a good length and thuds his pads in line with the off stump, Gayle was too lazy in getting his bat down on time and he played down the wrong line Bollinger to Dowlin, 1 wide sprays a full toss really wide outside off, the excitement gets to Bollinger Bollinger to Dowlin, 1 leg bye drifts close to the pads and he gently tucks it to the on side off the pads Johnson to Dowlin, 1 wide bowls him the bouncer just wide down the leg side, too high to chase that Bollinger to Morton, OUT tumbling like pins here, excellent delivery there, lands on a good length on middle and straightens a bit, Morton gets a touch forward but he's beaten for pace and gets hit on the pads in line with off and middle Bollinger to Simmons, OUT Doug's on fire! He bowls it on a fullish length and angles it just across the right-hander, Simmons is forced to play at it and he shapes to drive straight, the late movement catches the outside edge and another easy take for Haddin Johnson to Deonarine, OUT on the middle stump and hitting the leg stump or is it? Bowden certainly thinks so as Deonarine who was looking good has to go. There is an air of doubt around the dismissal as Bowden took his own sweet time in giving the decision and then walked over to the square leg umpire to discuss about it Watson to Ramdin, OUT the bowling change works! Watson bowls it dead straight on the channel outside off, the ball holds its line and Ramdin fishes outside the off stump with a half stride forward, thin edge and Haddin's good outing continues McKay to Smith, OUT terrific terrific catch! Hussey's pulled off the spectacular! Smith heaves the ball towards cow corner, Hussey sprints from long-on, he covers about 40 meters to his right at top speed before diving full length and taking the catch inches from the ground Check out the latest Time Out show with Harsha Bhogle, Peter Roebuck and Sanjay Manjrekar. It's about ball tampering. Roach to Watson, (no ball) oversteps first ball, pitches wide of off stump, free hit time Rampaul to Watson, 1 wide down the pads again, Watson flicks and misses, Ramdin leaps Smith to Ponting, 1 wide goes down the wrong line Roach to Clarke, 1 wide short ball to welcome Clarke, sails over and is called wide So that makes it 2-0 in Australia's favour. Ponting seals the win with a pull over square leg to a long hop. Bollinger is the Man of the Match. Thanks for tuning in today. Do come back and see us for game three on February 12. Bye for now! Australia won by 8 wickets (with 141 balls remaining) Player of the match is Doug Bollinger, AUS","Australia 2 for 171 (Ponting 57*, Watson 53) beat West Indies 170 (Smith 43, Bollinger 4-28) by 8 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Shane Watson got Australia off to a strong start in the chase with a smooth 53 Getty Images After the match was effectively sealed from the first ball when Chris Gayle fell, Australia ran over a disappointing West Indies for an eight-wicket victory to earn a 2-0 lead. The tourists were out-classed by Doug Bollinger in the early stages and slumped to 4 for 16 before scrambling to 170, a total which was never going to be large enough. Australia were not intimidated and Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting skipped to half-centuries as the win came in the 27th over. West Indies actually did well to last as long as 39.4 overs in their innings in a poorly timed performance given the current debate over the relevance of the 50-over game."
"2pm: Toss: West Indies have won the toss and Australia have been asked to bat first. The teams will be up shortly. Roach to Watson, 1 wide this time he doesn't control the radar and the ball slides down the legside Smith to Watson, 5 wide poor delivery, down the leg side and it beats everyone, including short fine leg Gayle to Watson, OUT well bowled there, he bowled it much flatter and dropped it a bit short too on sensing Watson's intentions, he gave him the charge but didn't get to the pitch of the ball, lands down Morton's throat at long-on Pollard to Ponting, OUT Pollard strikes! a back of length ball that jags in and takes the inside-edge with the Australian captain looking to drive off the front foot, and takes out offstump Rampaul to Hussey, OUT another drive away from the body gives a catch to Ramdin, Husset makes a bit of room to slice it hard through the offside, may have been a slower ball, too early on the shot and the thick edge it taken by the keeper after diving forward Rampaul to Johnson, OUT makes room to dig it out to the on side but he misses it, beaten for pace and the yorker ball thuds on to his leg stump Bollinger to Dowlin, OUT Windies are collapsing, Dowlin joins the procession, it was a delivery angling across the batsman, pitching outside off and going away, the batsman gets well forward and wafts away from his body, gets the outside edge to second slip Harris to Deonarine, 5 wide messes up his line this time, well down the leg side, it was a shortish ball but died on its way to the keeper, too low for a diving Haddin to collect Harris to Deonarine, 1 wide another delivery down the leg side Johnson to Deonarine, OUT Deonarine has played some good cuts today, but this time he can only find Ponting at backward point, superb catch from Ponting, timing his jump perfectly as he latched onto that overhead chance, great captaincy as well, Ponting wasn't in that position at the s Bollinger to Pollard, 1 leg bye down the leg side, looks to play it towards square leg, gets it on the pads and the ball dribbles towards backward point Hauritz to Pollard, OUT that's the end of Pollard, this shot would have been a six in many international ground, Pollard clubbed that one powerfully, but gets a bit too much height, Johnson is there at the long-on boundary, positioning himself nicely to take the catch a few metres insi Watson to Simmons, OUT and another big blow for West Indies, with that their slim hopes are gone, Simmons was looking to guide that length delivery towards third man but gets a thick edge to the keeper, the ball kept low but Haddin clings on to it after diving to his right Well, that was clinical from Australia, the bowling looked particularly good, especially with the new ball. The absence of the likes of Lee, Bracken and Siddle is hardly being felt, West Indies being rolled over for 143. Kieron Pollard showed us a glimpse of his all-round skills, and West Ind Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 8 for 256 (Watson 59, Pollard 3-45) beat West Indies 143 (Pollard 31, Harris 3-24, Hauritz 3-28) by 113 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Doug Bollinger's two early strikes were key moments in Australia's win Getty Images Another series, another opponent, same result. Two days after completing a tri-format clean-sweep against Pakistan, Australia continued their unbeaten summer with a 113-run victory over West Indies, set up by Shane Watson's half-century and Doug Bollinger's new-ball efforts. Chris Gayle's prediction of a 4-1 West Indies win can still come true but they have only one day to regroup before Tuesday's second match in Adelaide. The result was understandable given the number of stars missing from West Indies' line-up through injury, but disappointing after Kieron Pollard's career-best bowling performance helped peg Australia back following a strong start from Watson and Ricky Ponting. Keeping Australia to 8 for 256 after they were 1 for 135 having been sent in was a good effort and a brisk start from Gayle would have caused some flutters in the Australian camp."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. We will get the teams up shortly. Mohammad Asif to Warner, OUT fell for the trap! Warner makes a lot of room to crash that over the off side, the ball is there to be hit but he doesn't spot the fielder Imran Nazir at deep point, easy catch Umar Gul to Clarke, OUT good reflexes! Clarke gets slightly forward and beside the line to slash it away over the off side, but Fawad is alert at point and cups his hands behind that screamer, he kept his eyes on the ball which was like a bolt of lightning Umar Gul to White, OUT fabulous cricket from Pakistan! Gul catches White all at sea with a short delivery, the ball lobs off White's body and lobs to Fawad at point, Gul thinks White got some glove on it and they go up for the catch, but an unsettled and dazed White ambles out of his crease and an alert Fawad fires the throw at the Malik to Birt, OUT forgettable debut in the end for Birt, Malik comes round the wicket and fires it flat on the stumps, Birt goes a long way across and tries to paddle it away, the ball crashes on to leg and middle Naved-ul-Hasan to Smith, OUT the slower ball from hell! That was actually a googly! Naved foxes Smith who doesn't quite know whether to play at it or not, the ball cuts back in and slices him in half, he won't want to see a replay of that Umar Gul to Johnson, OUT it gets worse for Australia! Another terrific delivery, Gul bangs it in really short and it's a snorter, Johnson desperately sways backward to evade it and the ball brushes his glove, Kamran knows it Umar Gul to Tait, OUT easy catch for Alam this time, Tait gets forward to a pitched up delivery and ends up spooning it straight to point While we wait for Pakistan's response, check out our It won't be easy because the TV commentators are saying this is the fastest MCG wicket they've seen. Join us shortly. Johnson to Kamran, 1 wide bowls a yorker but its wide of off stump, Akmal backs away and misses and a wide is called Watson to Khalid Latif, OUT gets his man with the incutter! Pitches length, a slower ball it seems, and cuts back off the track to hit Latif on the flap as he shapes to work it away, looks to the naked eye as its headed into leg stump and so the umpire agrees ... but, but, but replays show a thin inside edge so Latif is unlucky, a b Tait to Malik, 1 leg bye full ball well down the pads, gets a bit of boot on the flick Johnson to Kamran, 1 leg bye goes to pull again and gets struck in the underarm, he was into the shot too early, the ball was short and there to be put away Player of the match is Shaun Tait, AUS","Australia 127 (Hussey 40*, Gul 3-20) beat Pakistan 9 for 125 (K Akmal 64, Tait 3-13) by 2 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Umar Gul took three wickets but it turned into Australia's night Getty Images Shaun Tait proved he can still be a force at international level as he helped Australia to a tense two-run win that completed a clean-sweep across all three formats against Pakistan this summer. Tait bowled the fastest ball ever recorded in Australia and grabbed 3 for 13 including the key wicket of Kamran Akmal, who had threatened to end Australia's streak with his highest Twenty20 score. Pakistan's trip has been notable for terrible fielding and the inability to capitalise whenever they got on top of Australia. This time their fielding was sharper than it had been at any stage over the past couple of months but their failure to keep Australia down remained a major issue. Despite dismissing Australia for 127 and being on track at 4 for 98 in the 15th over, they found a way to lose."
"Southee to Hussey, OUT we saw it coming! Southee had beaten Hussey just a short while back outside the off stump, this time he pitches it up outside off and draws Hussey to drive forward, takes the edge which was loud and clear, Rauf confirms it Vettori to Katich, OUT Katich falls just before tea! He shuffle across his stumps yet again and tries to clip it to the on side, but the ball goes straight off the bat and goes to Watling at forward short leg, no doubts about that at all Southee to Haddin, OUT another soft dismissal and New Zealand are taking them all, Haddin shapes to punch it through the off side but checks his shot and ends up tamely tapping it back to the bowler, that fielder at silly mid-off may have played on his mind Vettori to Johnson, OUT New Zealand are chipping away, Vettori bowls it flatter on the off stump, Johnson gets forward and offers a bat-pad catch to McIntosh at silly point who takes it inches off the turf, Aleem Dar sends him on his way immediately Southee to North, OUT North is referring this, the ball lands on middle and goes through with the line, North plays all around it and is hit flush on the pad bang in front of middle, looked obvious to us and Asad Rauf, North challenges it but in the end it's a referral used up by Australia Southee to Harris, 1 leg bye on the leg side and he clips him away down to fine leg Vettori to Harris, OUT Vettori strikes, the Australian collapse continues, the arm ball does the job, Harris is hit on the front foot as he looks to whip it square, in front of middle and leg, Harris is gone Vettori to Bollinger, OUT the bails are down and the innings is over, Vettori bowls this one quicker and flatter, the ball clips the pad and clips the stumps as Bollinger gets forward to defend, leaves a big gap between pad and bat So Southee and Vettori combine to skittle out Australia for 231 after losing the toss. Australia will look back at the innings with a lot of regret because some of their main batters threw it away - Watson, Ponting, Clarke and to a lesser extent, Katich. Having said that, the bowlers were consistent and kept the pressure on and didn't let any Bollinger to McIntosh, OUT McIntosh had no idea where his off stump was! Bollinger lands it on a fullish length just outside off and gets it to nip back in, McIntosh shoulders arms but looks back to see his off stump pegged back, Bollinger kisses the Australian crest and not the VB sponsor logo! Harris to Taylor, 1 wide called wide for height, the bouncer goes over head-high as he ducks under it Hauritz to Taylor, SIX runs what a strike, slog-swept from way outside off, and Watson has no chance of catching this, they have lost the ball behind midwicket, big six Hauritz to Taylor, SIX runs Taylor is on fire here, and this ground is too small, Hauritz - brave man - flights it again, and gets it in Taylor's arc, and watches it sail over long-on Bollinger to Taylor, OUT review, Taylor goes for the boundary with the field up, goes for the pull shot, the ball is too full, Aussies appeal for a bottom edge, Asad Rauf doesn't move. Hot spot shows a faint tickle as the ball passes the bat, and Rauf overturns his decision Johnson to Southee, SIX runs whoa, Southee proving those defensive fields right! 15 rows back over long leg, clears the front leg, Johnson sends in a bouncer and he swings and connects Innings Start Michael Clarke is going to be used with his left-arm orthodox spin just before tea","Australia 231 & 511 for 8 dec beat New Zealand 264 & 302 (Guptill 58, McCullum 51, Johnson 6-73) by 176 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Mitchell Johnson finishes his Test summer on a high with 6 for 73 Getty Images Mitchell Johnson achieved his second ten-wicket match haul in Tests to finish off New Zealand before lunch as Australia swept to a 2-0 series victory. New Zealand resumed at 185 for 5 chasing a record-breaking target of 479, but Johnson and Doug Bollinger dismissed them for 302 to secure a 176-run victory. Johnson was responsible for causing the early damage in the pursuit on day four when his high-speed spells gained three wickets and he backed up with another three. The 6 for 73 followed his 4 for 59 in the first innings and gave him 12 victims for the series. The performance ensured Australia finished an unbeaten summer with seven wins in eight Tests."
"Bollinger steams in but pulls out of the delivery at the last minute Johnson to Southee, OUT length ball and Southee who has no faith in Martin as he swings to mid wicket, big noise as the ball passes the bat. The Australians are confident and Southee is given out but he refers the decision instantly. Clearly a noise as the ball passes the bat but nothing from hot spot. The replay suggests there is no contact with the bat but no concrete evidence to reverse the decision. Unlucky for Southee but great Innings Start Well, Australia will be very happy with a complete performance in this first test match. A magnificant century from Clarke in the first innings, which won his the man of the match award, with great support from North who also made a century under pressure really set up the game. The New Zealanders showed a lack of application in their first innings as Doug Bollinger bowled brilliantly to ensure the follow on was enforced. The second inning","Australia 459 for 5 dec & 106 for 0 (Hughes 86*) beat New Zealand 157 & 407 (McCullum 104, McIntosh 83, Vettori 77) by 10 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Phillip Hughes raced Australia to victory with 86 not out, but he will probably have to make way for Shane Watson in the second Test Getty Images It took Australia longer than they expected, but Phillip Hughes' final-day blast allowed them to finish off New Zealand and gain a 1-0 lead heading into the final Test in Hamilton on Saturday. Brendon McCullum's inspired 104 forced the visitors to chase 106, a target they achieved without loss before lunch thanks to Hughes' aggressive 86 off 75 balls. After spending time in the field over four days, Ryan Harris, the debutant, sealed a quick finish of New Zealand's second innings, taking 4 for 77 as the hosts were dismissed for 407. Hughes, who grabbed 12 fours and a six, was then in a hurry to end the game and sped to the 10-wicket victory in 23 overs. It was left to Simon Katich, who played the anchor with 18, to take the winning single on the final ball before lunch."
"6.40pm Australia won the toss and will bowl Hazlewood to Rahul, 1 leg bye good length and sliding onto the pads. Looks to whip that over short fine, cops it on the thigh Starc to S Dhawan, OUT knocks out off stump with a trademark delivery! He's back. Starc is back. High 140s, outswinger starting middle and curving viciously towards off. Dhawan's got his front leg in the leg side and his stumps exposed as he creates room for the drive through cover. The late swing and the pace does him and it's a pretty sight as the st Starc to Kohli, 1 wide full and very wide outside off. Searching for that swing, but this is past the tramline. Kohli lets it go Swepson to Kohli, OUT balloons back to the bowler. The only thing going for Swepson this ball is that it has gripped. It's short but it's gripped and turned away and gotten big on Kohli in the corridor. He's shaping to pull but checks himself and it pops back gently to the bowler off the leading edge Abbott to Samson, 1 wide slips this full down the leg side Henriques to Samson, OUT straight to cover! Full outside off, was in the slot for the drive, but Samson couldn't have picked out the fielder on the edge of the ring with any more precision Henriques to Pandey, 1 wide loses his line down the leg side so a bonus ball for India Zampa to Pandey, OUT good catch at short third man! Hazlewood does well to get down to that. Pandey went back to a slightly shorter ball, goes for the cut, it takes the top edge and is dipping as it reaches Hazlewood Henriques to Hardik, 1 leg bye short of a length, gets himself into a tangle here as he looks to pull, hammers into Pandya's hip and loops away. That will be painful Henriques to Hardik, SIX runs into the stands! Pandya had changed his bat before that ball and this one is working nicely. Full outside off, he's able to get underneath and swings high and mighty over long-on Henriques to Hardik, OUT high...very high, and taken at long-off! Pandya is cut off before he can really get going, gets all height on this one, low down on the bat, Smith has plenty of time to get underneath it Starc to Sundar, 2 wide another full toss, sprayed down the leg side, Wade gets a glove on it Hazlewood to Jadeja, SIX runs that's MASSIVE! Full outside off, Jadeja picks it up and swings it miles back over deep square leg. Almost onto the root of the stand Starc to Sundar, OUT straight to long-on...couldn't get the distance on it and a comfortable catch WATCH: Hardik Pandya holes out to Steven Smith at long-off (India subcontinent only) 9:12pm Alright, we're ready for the chase. It's Finch and Short coming out to open. Wade is slated to bat No. 3. Chahar with the ball. Chahar to Finch, 1 leg bye good length and into the pads, looks for the flick and cops it on the pad Natarajan to Maxwell, OUT huge appeal for lbw! And Kohli has reviewed almost before the ball stops rolling away. Where did it pitch? Was smashing the stumps for sure. Maxwell playing back to a short of a length delivery. Beaten for pace. We have a small delay waiting for ball tracking. And now the pitch map is missing from the replay. Here it comes... Sundar to Short, 1 leg bye deflects off the pad to short fine leg as he misses the pull...was a short ball, he missed out Chahal to Short, 1 wide wide outside off, he misses the cut and gets the wide call...Kohli isn't impressed Player of the match is Yuzvendra Chahal, INDIA","India 161 for 7 (Rahul 51, Jadeja 44*, Henriques 3-22, Starc 2-34) beat Australia 150 for 7 (Finch 35, Short 34, Chahal 3-25, Natarajan 3-30) by 11 runs Concussion substitute Yuzvendra Chahal plucked three vital wickets and opened a fresh chapter in cricket's long history of debating topics after being chosen - controversially - to replace Ravindra Jadeja, delivering India a comfortable victory in the opening T20I at Manuka Oval in Canberra. ALSO WATCH: Match highlights - Jadeja, Chahal, Natarajan help India win series opener (India subcontinent only) Jadeja's exit from the contest - he suffered a hamstring injury first and was then hit on the helmet in the last over of India's innings - allowed India to call upon a wristspinner in Chahal, who had been harshly treated during the ODI series but found himself defending a serviceable total on the night and responding grandly. Yuzvendra Chahal made a big impact after coming on as a concussion substitute Getty Images In contrast, the Australians gradually lost grip of a contest that had appeared more or less in their keeping when India were restricted to 114 for 6 with 19 balls of their innings remaining after Aaron Finch sent them in to bat. A target of 162 should still have been well within the grasp of Finch's team, but their innings sank steadily into the mire thanks to Chahal, T Natarajan's zippy left-armers, and Virat Kohli's growing command of the battlefield. Starc returns in finer fettle Something was not quite right about Mitchell Starc in the first two ODIs, and he was missing from the third with what was described as a minor side and/or rib complaint."
"Ricky Ponting has won his 6th toss in a row and Australia will bowl first. McKay to McCullum, OUT good length as McCullum comes down the track, he is hurried up and he pushes in the air to Ponting at mid off McKay to Guptill, 1 leg bye back of a length in at the body and he beats Guptill's bat and it takes him on the body and they take a leg bye into the off side Johnson to Stewart, OUT full outside off and Stewart plays with no conviction and edges through to Haddin, New Zealand in early trouble here at the 'Cake Tin' Watson to Taylor, OUT bumper from Watson outside off and Talylor pulls it high into the leg side and Bollinger moves around from fine leg to take an easy catch in the deep. Watson, once again, makes the important breakthrough Johnson to Vettori, 1 wide bouncer is very short and Vettori goes underneath and it's called wide Johnson to Vettori, 1 wide Johnson tries around the wicket and it doesn't work immediately as he bowls down leg Hauritz to Styris, SIX runs tossed up and hammered over mid wicket for six, that's massive and that's his fifty Hopes to Styris, OUT good length ball and it seams back into him, he gets an inside edge and hits middle and off stump, great delivery Bollinger to Vettori, OUT Vettori steps away to leg, Bollinger hits the perfect channel, Vettori plays and misses and Bollinger cleans him out, well bowled buyt some poor batting from New Zealand here Hauritz to Hopkins, OUT Hopkins looks to comes down the pitch but it's short and he moves but to cut but edges it to Haddin and Australia are jubilant again Watson to Tuffey, 1 leg bye angled into the pads, Tuffey misses out as it takes him on the thigh pad and they take a leg bye Johnson to McCullum, OUT good length and McCullum tries to play through the leg side, he gets a leading edge straight up into the air and Johnson moves back and collects the catch Johnson to McCullum, 1 wide full and wide down leg McKay to Tuffey, OUT low full toss which Tuffey hits high into the air and Ponting moves forward from the mid wicket boundary, gets under it safely and completes the catch Johnson and McKay both took two wickets but it was a good all-round performance from Australia to contain the hosts to 241. Another good performance from Australia in the field and with the ball. They took wickets at crucial times, just as New Zealand started to build partnerships, as they have done right throughout the series. This weekend also sees the start of the 2010 Formula One season.

Bond to Ponting, OUT good quick bumper to Ponting first up and he is surprised by the pace, shapes to pull but then decides against it, it takes him on the helmet, close to his gloves and it goes through to Hopkins, New Zealand go up a Vettori to Watson, 1 wide angled down the leg side and called wide Southee to White, OUT good length ball and White tries to hit over the top again but closes the face slightly and it goes high in the air and Vettori moves back from mid off to take the catch, important breakthrough from the hosts Southee to Voges, OUT back of a length and he tries to cut but misses and it goes through to Hopkins, the New Zealanders appeal in unison and Asad Rauf gives it out. Voges might be unlucky there McCullum to Watson, OUT quicker delivery and Watson drives, plays a fraction too early and hits it to Taylor at mid wicket That breakthrough is a big one for the home side and is reward for some good tight bowling to Watson over the l Southee to Hussey, OUT yorker length from Southee and Hussey goes down on one knee trying to lap it but he misses and the ball cannons into leg stump, crucial breakthrough for New Zealand as they have the dangerman back in the hut Southee to Johnson, 1 wide bouncer is well down the leg side and it's called wide Southee to Johnson, OUT length ball from Southee and Johnson tries to swing it high into the stands but he mistimes it and Franklin gets underneath it at long on and takes the catch This weekend also sees the start of the 2010 Formula One season.

The 51-run triumph might at least give New Zealand some spark heading in to the Test series, which begins up the road at the Basin Reserve on Friday, and it left the ODI scoreline at 3-2. Ricky Ponting didn't lose a toss for the whole series and again made New Zealand set a target, but this time on a two-paced pitch their 241 for 9 appeared competitive. A double-wicket maiden from Bond early on put Australia on the back foot before Southee ran through the middle-order with 4 for 36 to confirm the win as Australia were dismissed for 190 with 3.5 overs to spare."
"Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. Ponting is happy with the formula they used during the last match in Hamilton and he sees that as the best way to win the game and the series. Amazingly, it's his fourth straight correct call with the toss. Harris to McCullum, SIX runs Harris drops short and McCullum is back and pulling over the short boundary at fine leg for six into the construction site Watson to Guptill, OUT Watson is full again and Guptill isn't totally in control of the drive, nonetheless he hits it pretty cleanly but just off the carpet and Ponting swoops at short cover and collects a good catch low down, big wicket for Australia Johnson to Taylor, 1 wide Johnson errs on line and he strays down leg Johnson to Taylor, 5 wide great bumper from Johnson and Taylor just sways inside the line and it really takes off and flies over Haddin for four and it's called too high. Harsh decision going against Johnson there Johnson to Taylor, 1 wide pitched up and far too wide of off stump Johnson to Taylor, 1 leg bye Johnson misses his line again and it takes Taylor on the thigh and falls into the leg side Watson to Taylor, 1 leg bye good channel nips back and Taylor tries to square cut but misses, it takes him on the back pad but he's hit outside the line of off and Asad Rauf says not out Watson to McCullum, SIX runs McCullum advances and seizes the moment by hammering a good length ball over cover to the short boundary for six. He hit that like a tracer bullet. Just so clean. He will need to bat for a long period today if New Zealand are to post a competitive score Hopes to McCullum, 3 wide angled down the leg side and Haddin misses the ball and removes the bails without the ball and they get a couple to fine leg Hopes to Taylor, OUT full on leg stick and Taylor clips it from the middle of the bat out to deep square leg where Hussey moves quickly and takes a good diving catch low down Hauritz to Stewart, OUT Stewart comes down the track, looks to hit it straight down the ground in the air but drags it towards Watson at long on who takes the simplest of catches Hauritz to McCullum, OUT uses his feet and chips it straight to White at mid wicket. Poor dismissal as the pressure told and Australia are extremely happy to remove the dangerman Hopes to Styris, OUT Hopes hits a good fullish length and Styris plays a fraction early, it takes a leading edge and floats back to Hopes who takes a good catch low down in his follow through Johnson to Vettori, OUT full and swings into Vettori who stays on the crease and is trapped dea in front, no problems giving that out for umpire Baxter, that was very adjacent Hopes to Hopkins, 1 wide bumper from Hopes and it's too high and just down the leg side so called wide Hauritz to Franklin, OUT Franklin goes down on one knee and tries to sweep a ball that is down the leg side, he gets a glove on it and drags it back onto the stumps. That is unlucky but when things aren't goin so well those things tend to go against you Hauritz to Tuffey, SIX runs fuller again from Hauritz, Tuffey goes down on one knee and sweeps over deep backward square for six Hauritz to Tuffey, SIX runs full and wide of off stump, Tuffey goes down on one knee and slog sweeps straight down the ground fro six more. That's three in a row for the big fella! Sensational stuff Watson to Hopkins, OUT back of a length and Hopkins tries to play square into the off side but it takes the outside edge and through to Haddin. Crucial breakthrough as it's the first ball of the Batting Power Play Harris to Tuffey, OUT half volley and Tuffey cracks it back at Harris and he twists in his follow through to take a superb grab and Tuffey's cameo is over. That is a superb cacth from Harris, you just can't keep him out of the action, nor the wickets Johnson to Bond, OUT pitched up on off stump, Bond tries to hit it over mid on but gets it low on the bat and Hauritz moves forward and takes a good catch at ground level and New Zealand are bowled out for the third consecutive match 7.40pm The players are on their way back out onto the field with Australia needing 200 to win from just 34 overs. Power Play 1 is 7 overs, Power Play 2 (bowling) is 4 overs and Power Play 3 (batting) is 3 overs long. Bond to begin to Watson 6.55pm The rain has stopped and the ground staff are out in the middle trying to dry the ground which is quite damp without having any areas of the ground clogged with surface water. 6.05pm It is still raining here and while it is not heavy it has been a consistent downpour. There is enough moisture out there to keep the players from the field for a time yet. If we are able to get play before 6.30pm there will be no loss of overs, however, from that time on we will be losing time and overs. I will keep Nathan Hauritz was the pick of the bowlers for the visitors, taking three for 46, with his only blip being hit for three consecutive sixes by Daryl Tuffey. Shane Watson continues to take crucial wickets at vital moments, dismissing Guptill just when New Zealand were starting to gain the upper hand and then Hopkins from the Tuffey to Ponting, SIX runs Ponting advances and hits Tuffey straight back over his head for six. He didn't time it perfectly but he got it well enough to drop just over the rope. Tuffey must be finding this hard to handle after it looked as though he had him LBW just two overs back Bond to Hussey, 1 leg bye back of a length in at the hip and Hussey gets his thigh pad on it and takes the leg bye to fine leg On behalf of the crew here at Cricinfo, this is Marc Ellison signing off. Bye for now, see you in two days time. Nathan Hauritz made the important breakthroughs, nabbing McCullum, Stewart and Franklin in a spell that squeezed the life out of the New Zealand innings. Watson, again, provided the crucial partnership-breaking wickets and finished with for two for 24. Cameron Whites deserves a lot of praise for bringing the game home with 50 not out and his amazing summer continues. Hussey and Voges played important innings too.

Rain played some part in the outcome but it was mostly New Zealand's watered-down batting display that left their fans feeling gloomy and consigned Saturday's fifth match in Wellington to dead-rubber status. The hosts had only themselves to blame for failing to bat out their overs and after rain reduced the target from 239 off 50 overs to 200 from 34 overs, Australia found their way home with 17 balls to spare. Cameron White and Michael Hussey completed the chase, which was set up by Ponting and Shane Watson, and despite a couple of quick wickets in the middle from Daniel Vettori the visitors were on track for most of the evening. The Man of the Match, White was cool with an unbeaten 50 and Hussey finished on 28, easing any tension the Australians felt when Adam Voges (34) was caught at midwicket with 50 runs still required."
"Harris to Ingram, OUT cracking delivery from Harris, he hits a good length and Ingram plays without intent and edges through to Haddin who takes the simplest of catches. Great start for Australia Bollinger to McCullum, OUT good length, McCullum moves back and looks to push into the off side, it takes the inside edge back onto his pads and then onto the stumps and Bollinger is rapt with that. Well bowled, the change of angle did the trick Johnson to Guptill, OUT fuller, a fraction slower and Guptill drives from low on the bat in the air to White at short cover who takes a very easy catch, well bowled Johnson and the Australians are delighted Hauritz to Broom, 1 bye nicely flighted from Hauritz and Broom is beaten on the inside edge and Haddin can't hold on and they take a bye. That has turned a mile from outside off Johnson to Broom, OUT cracking ball from Johnson as he spears it into leg stump, it swings away just enough and Broom is squared up trying to play to mid on/mid wicket and it takes the edge through to Watson at first slip. Australia and Johnson break what was a promising partnership Watson to Taylor, OUT bumper from Watson and Taylor takes the bait, pulling off the top edge out to Hussey on the square leg fence, he moves forward and takes the catch low down. Watson has a real knack of taking wickets at crucial times and there's another. Advantage Australia. Taylor absolutely furious Bollinger to Hopkins, SIX runs Bollinger goes short and Hopkins upper cuts over third man for six. Daryl Tuffey, who is not playing due to a calf strain, stands up off his seat and takes a comfortable catch in the stands Watson to Styris, SIX runs back of a length but just a fraction too straight and Styris whips him over backward square for a maximum. Great timing Watson to Styris, OUT fuller from Watson, Styris tires to hit him straight down the ground over the top, he plays too early and gets it high in the air and Harris moves forward from long off to take the catch at mid off Johnson to Hopkins, 1 wide full and too wide of off stump Harris to Hopkins, OUT low full toss and Hopkins drives in the air to Watson at mid off. He got underneath it but got it high on the blade with no timing whatsoever. Important breakthrough for Australia with only Southee and Mason to come Harris to Southee, OUT Southee walks slightly across his stumps and tries to work it through the leg side and it sneaks past his pads and takes leg stump and New Zealand sink further into trouble! Harris with another breakthrough Johnson to Bond, OUT full and straight and Bond drives and edges through to Haddin and Australia wrap up the innings quickly. Southee to Haddin, 1 leg bye too straight from Southee and Haddin gets a pad on it and they take a leg bye into the leg side Guptill to Hussey, 1 wide drifts down the leg side and called wide Vettori to Haddin, OUT 76 kph, well flighted and Haddin tries to hammer it out of the ground but misses and Hopkins has plenty of time to remove the bails. The end of a great innings from Haddin, not a bad replacement at the top of the order... Haddin (110) and Ponting (69) added 151 for the second wicket and the match was over pretty early in that sense with both players looking in total control at the crease. Australia win by the comfortable margin of six wickets with 16 balls to spare. Australia outplayed New Zealand in all departments today and will take a lot of momentum into the 4th ODI in Auckland on Thursday. Australia won by 6 wickets (with 16 balls remaining) Player of the match is Brad Haddin, AUS","Australia 248 for 4 (Haddin 110, Ponting 69) beat New Zealand 245 (Taylor 62, Johnson 3-41, Harris 3-48) by 6 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Brad Haddin's best ODI score buried New Zealand Getty Images Brad Haddin's second one-day international century gave Australia a 2-1 lead and the most one-sided victory of the tour, as they chased down their target with 16 balls to spare. Haddin's 110 was his highest ODI score and he ended Daniel Vettori's hopes of winning what he said before the match was ""the most important game of the series"". Ricky Ponting was annoyed in the opening two games at his batsmen's inability to capitalise on their starts, and they resolved that problem at Seddon Park. Ponting made 69 and combined with Haddin for a matchwinning 151-run partnership that justified Ponting's rare decision to send New Zealand in. It is a gamble he has taken 24 times in his ODI captaincy career for a remarkable 20 victories."
"Welcome to Eden Park for the second ODI. Australia have won the toss and are batting first. No changes for the visitors, Daniel Vettori is back for Jacob Oram and Ross Taylor has missed out Bond to Watson, 1 wide and it's well wide of off stump, Billy Bowden calls it a wide and there's no doubt about that decision Tuffey to Haddin, SIX runs what a great shot! Outstanding strike from Haddin as he walks a couple of paces down the pitch and lifts this one from off stump over wide midwicket, he's g Tuffey to Watson, 1 wide tight call there from Rudi Koertzen, Watson tries to lash Tuffey through point but misses and it is pretty much on the line that guides the umpires regarding Tuffey to Watson, OUT gone! Watson tries to go over midwicket but he hasn't timed that well enough. There's a man on the boundary, it's Martin Guptill, and he takes a safe catch. Vettori to Ponting, OUT oh Ricky, what was that? So much for getting his eye in, Ponting tries for a big slog over midwicket but gets a thick top edge that flies high and is taken by Vettori to Haddin, OUT what a catch! Magnificent return take from Vettori! Haddin has positively laced that drive after taking a couple of steps down the pitch, it flew wide of Vettor Bond to Clarke, OUT short and Clarke tries to pull, with both feet off the ground the ball lobbing to mid on for a simple catch Bond to Hussey, 1 wide short outside off, Rudi Koertzen says it's a wide and on replay it looks a poor call Southee to Hussey, 1 wide short and tries to hook, a big shout for caught behind perhaps to con the umpire into not calling a wide, which Bowden does eventually call Tuffey to White, SIX runs short and hooked it away flat and somehow for six! Good shot but I'd doubt if that would be six at any other venue in the world Southee to Hussey, 1 wide short down leg side, obvious wide Bollinger to McCullum, SIX runs short and hooks it in the deep square leg construction site - McCullum seeing them very well early Johnson to McCullum, OUT tries to work to leg, getting an edge and Haddin dives to his right, in front of slip and hangs onto a blinder of a catch. The end of a brief but entertaining Harris to Broom, OUT an appeal first up and he is gone - caught on the crease at this one looked pretty good - dead line, height not an issue Johnson to Franklin, OUT tries to pull and he gets a glove down the leg side, Franklin walks and he is gone -- Kiwis in all sorts of bother as Franklin limps off Johnson to Guptill, 1 wide wide of the batsman and swinging further away Watson to Guptill, OUT plays back to one that moves away slightly, the edge is found and taken by Haddin - Guptil goneski!!! Watson to Styris, 1 wide short and leg side, tries to pull missing it and gets a wide Hauritz to Styris, OUT same shot as the previous ball, but this time he hits it in the air and Ponting leaps up and takes a good catch - a vital wicket and the Kiwis chances take a bi Harris to Vettori, 1 wide leg side wide as Vettori slightly distracts him by moving the off side Watson to Hopkins, OUT bumper, hooks at it getting a top to long leg where Bollinger holds onto a catch. Might have been a fraction high for the shot, but when you need 8 an over to w Hauritz to Vettori, 1 leg bye tries to work to leg and gets a bit of bat onto it Johnson to Bond, OUT very full and he plays inside it and he loses his stump -- well bowled by Johnson, at last a bowler goes full and straight and it has paid off Johnson to Vettori, 1 leg bye late inswinger, hits him on the pad but angling down leg Harris to Vettori, OUT steps to the off side and he tries to glance it, but misses and loses his off stump - Australia wins the game and levels the series at one apiece What a finish - full credit to the Aussies for getting over the line, another great game of 50 over cricket in the battle for the Chappell Hadlee trophy. Smart bowling in the end from Harris Player of the match is Daniel Vettori, NZ","Injury doubts over Ross Taylor and James Franklin have led to the elevation of the uncapped Shanan Stewart to New Zealand's squad ahead of the third ODI in Hamilton on Tuesday. Stewart, the Canterbury batsman, is in the middle of an excellent season and has won some recognition following the hamstring problems of Taylor and Franklin. The pair is in doubt for the remainder of the five-match ODI series, with Taylor pulling out before the loss in Auckland and Franklin hobbling off during the game. Mark Greatbatch, New Zealand's coach, said they were unlikely to play on Tuesday but Taylor was the greater chance to return for the final fixtures. Stewart, 27, is in outstanding form after making 227 against Central Districts on Sunday and has been redirected to Hamilton."
"Tuffey to Clarke, OUT Clarke comes down the track and Tuffey bends his back and surprises Clarke as he tries to guide it fine through third man but it takes the outside edge and through to McCullum to complete the catch Tuffey to White, OUT Tuffey strikes right away with the new-ish ball as he hits a good length, it seams back in just a fraction and White plays all around it. Big strike for New Zealand Southee to Hussey, 1 bye slower length ball from Southee and Hussey swings and misses but it bounces in front of McCullum and he can't pick it up cleanly and they take a bye Southee to Hopes, OUT Southee strikes with the yorker. If it ain't broke why fix it seems to be the mindset from Southee as Hopes tries to swing it over mid wicket but the ball cannons into middle stump Bond to Hussey, OUT Bond goes full but not quite yorker length and he looks to swing it over the leg side but misses and it clips the outside of off stump and the bails trickle off the stumps Tuffey to Hauritz, OUT Tuffey bowls a half volley and Hauritz gets under it and chips it to long off where Nathan McCullum dives low to catch it after initially misjudging it Right, well New Zealand will be rather pleased with their effort to restrict Australia to under 300. Most of the Australian batsmen got starts but they seemed to struggle with the pace of the wicket at times and were unable to push on. Some good death bowling from Southee Johnson to Ingram, OUT fullish delivery and Ingram drives in the air over mid off, Hussey moves back very quickly and takes a great catch over his shoulder and has to fall to the ground to complete the catch. Superb snare from Mr. Cricket Watson to Guptill, 1 wide angled down the leg side and called wide Hopes to Taylor, SIX runs just a fraction short and Taylor loves that length when he's in the right mood and he pull/slogs over mid wicket for a maximum! Hauritz to Franklin, OUT tossed up by Hauritz, Franklin tries to play inside the line and play the ball into the off side but it takes the outside edge and Haddin juggles it but takes it on the third attempt behind the stumps. Good catch and an important break thro Johnson to Taylor, 1 wide bumper from Johnson and it's just far too short this time Watson to Taylor, OUT Watson goes short and hurries Taylor for room and he pulls the ball high on the bat out to mid wicket where Hussey moves around safely to complete the catch. Great break through for Australia Bollinger to Broom, OUT Bollinger hustles in and bowls back of a length and Broom looks to cut but chops it back onto his stumps. The Aussie's are joyous and Bollinger strikes again! The momentum has really shifted since Taylor's dismissal Bollinger to Styris, SIX runs length ball from Bollinger and Styris just hits through the line and over mid off for six! What a finish and what an innings from Styris! New Zealand always looked on target for victory with Ross Taylor at the wicket but when he was out from the bowling of Watson at 204 for five in the 39th over, New Zealand needed an old hand to stand up. New Zealand win by two wickets with four balls remaining. The pressure was on him towards the death and Styris comes through with a fantastic innings under pressure. Styris was a late inclusion when Daniel Vettori had to pull out with a neck complaint and he has justified New Zealand won by 2 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Ross Taylor, NZ","New Zealand 281 for 8 (Taylor 70, Styris 49*) beat Australia 275 for 8 (Hussey 59, Tuffey 3-58) by two wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Scott Styris launched a six in the final over to seal New Zealand's win Getty Images Scott Styris went from probable 12th man to match-winner after guiding New Zealand to a two-wicket victory in a tense chase of 276 in Napier. Styris began the day outside New Zealand's starting XI but was called in late due to Daniel Vettori's stiff neck, and the inclusion helped Ross Taylor start his international captaincy career on a high. Styris sealed the win with a six over long-off from the second ball of the 50th over from Doug Bollinger and finished unbeaten on 49 from 34 deliveries. He roared as the ball sailed over the boundary and was pumped up after he and Mitchell Johnson appeared to clash head and helmet in the 46th over, in which Styris slogged two boundaries. He and Shane Bond had combined for a 35-run stand that meant Jacob Oram did not have to bat after suffering a potentially serious injury to his left knee in the field."
"11.00am Right, first blood to Collingwood! England have won the toss and will bowl first. Collingwood reckons the pitch looks good but won't change in character as the day goes on. Both teams are unchanged so will line up like this: Sidebottom to Watson, OUT gone! Sidebottom strikes! Watson flashes at a short and widish ball, flies off the top edge to Kieswetter, who can't quite hold on, bounces off his gloves and Swann takes the rebound! Massive breakthrough for England. Sidebottom to Clarke, 1 wide another one shoved in down the leg side, Clarke attempted to fiddle it away, but misses and it's another wide Bresnan to Clarke, OUT Warner gone this time! England on fire, Clarke pushes a good-length ball to cover, and then attempts a single, Warner tares down but Lumb swooped in and under-armed his throw on to the stumps at the strikers end to leave Warner well short of his ground Sidebottom to Haddin, OUT Sidebottom strikes again! Australia lose another wicket! Short and down the leg side from Sidebottom, hardly a great ball, but Haddin swung hard at it and it came off what looks like the thigh, Kieswetter took an excellent catch high to his left. Great catch but very unlucky for Haddin Bresnan to Hussey, 1 leg bye Hussey can't quite find his range at the moment, this was arrowed down the leg side, but he couldn't get the flick away and it comes off the pads for a leg bye Swann to Clarke, OUT brilliant from Collingwood! Fantastic catch! Swann flighted it up, and beat Clarke in the air as he skipped down the wicket, in the end it's chipped into what looked a vacant straight midwicket, but Collingwood dived to his left from short midwicket, two-handed and plucked it out the air Wright to White, OUT White gone this time! Broad takes the catch! Really good from Broad, it was another fullish ball, White had a big swish and it came off the outside edge miles in the air, Broad called for it straight away from point and ran behind him to hold on to an excellent, crucial catch Yardy to Hussey, SIX runs well, finally the shackles are broken! Shorter and Hussey swiped it brilliantly, sending it miles over midwicket for six Sidebottom to Hussey, 1 wide this time it will be a wide, Hussey looking to edge leg side of the ball and swing through cover, Sidebottom shoving it outside off, but too far for the umpire A short wait is over, the players are out in the middle and we're all set for England's chase. Put your seatbelts on, kids! Johnson to Pietersen, 5 wide and the change of angle has done him. That started wide of leg and went further, beating a diving Brad Haddin and away to the boundary ""When you want to be the best you've got to beat the best. When we got them three wickets down early doors, we gave ourselves a great opportunity. We want to kick on from this. This is the first trophy we've ever won, we're going to enjoy it, we'r going to savour it."" So, hugs, handshakes and backslaps all round as England have won their first world title in cricket! They were picked out as the dark horses to win this tournament, and after a stuttering, rain-affected start to the group stages, they hit their stride superbly in the Super Eights, winning all their games in that stage, followed by a thumping win in the semi-finals over Sri Lanka. The England dug-out leapt as one when the w England won by 7 wickets (with 18 balls remaining) Player of the match is Craig Kieswetter, ENG","England 148 for 3 (Kieswetter 63) beat Australia 147 for 6 (D Hussey 59) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Hawkeye Kevin Pietersen was named Player of the Tournament after another irresistible display with the bat Getty Images Craig Kieswetter and Kevin Pietersen powered England to their first ICC global title with an irresistible 111-run stand for the second wicket, as Australia were outmuscled in a battle of the bowlers at Bridgetown. Despite a brave recovery led by David Hussey, who made 59 from 54 balls, Australia's hopes of claiming the only world title to have eluded them were devastated from the moment they lost three wickets in 13 legitimate deliveries in a stunning start to the contest. Chasing a target of 148, Kieswetter and Pietersen broke the back of the chase in an 11-over alliance, but fittingly it was left to England's captain, Paul Collingwood, to seal the victory with 18 balls to spare. At the moment of victory, he was mobbed by his jubilant team-mates as they poured out of the dug-out, with incredulity and triumph writ large on their features. Barely 12 months ago, Collingwood was leading England to defeat against the Netherlands in the opening contest of the 2009 event."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and chosen to bowl. Tait to Salman Butt, 1 wide And the third one arrives. This one sails high over Salman. Wide. Nannes hit the full length. Tait is bowling short. Nannes to Kamran, 1 wide Will it be short? Will it be a yorker? will it be a slower one? Well .. it's an overpitched delivery well down the leg side. Watson to Salman Butt, 1 wide bouncer just outside leg stump, Butt goes down under Johnson to Kamran, OUT What a catch from Warner! Stunning! Kamran falls after an awesome knock. He drove this one uppishly towards deep cover where Warner rushed forward and threw himself forward to take the catch Nannes to Afridi, 1 wide starts his spell with a wide down the leg side. Afridi walks towards square-leg. Nannes grimaces. Hussey to Afridi, OUT Big moment this. Afridi is gone. IT was a full delivery outside off and Afridi tried to heave it away but ended up slicing it towards point. WAtson came in, Haddin rushed out and both collided but Haddin takes it. He was the man with the gloves and it was his catch. Nannes to Khalid Latif, OUT Warner again. Simple catch this time. It was the short delivery around off stump, Latif tried to pull but was in no position for it. The ball lobbed of the edge to mid-off Hussey to Abdul Razzaq, 2 wide pushes this full and outside off and Haddin can't collect Hussey to Abdul Razzaq, 1 wide another wide down the off side. The wheels are coming off Tait to Abdul Razzaq, 1 bye full and well outside the off stump, just inside the wide line.. swing and a miss.. Haddin collects and under-arms the throw but by then they are across. Amir to Warner, 1 wide banged in short, Warner ducks and it has been called a wide. Afridi is surprised with that call. Amir to Warner, OUT Warner is gone for a duck. They are dancing in the aisles. It was the full length delivery going away from Warner who cuts it straight to backward point. That boy Umar again! What a start for Pakistan. What a tame dismissal. A very soft shot. Amir to Watson, OUT What a moment this. The openers are back in the hutch. Pressure. Watson has hit a full delivery straight to long-on! The Pakistan dug-out is celebrating. The fans are screaming in joy. Enter Pup. The Australian captain is in the middle. What can he do now? Abdur to Haddin, OUT Stumped! Haddin went dancing down the track but the ball curved past him. It dipped rapidly on the advancing Haddin, gripped the surface and broke away to Kamran who does the rest. Third wicket down and Australia are wobbling here in St Lucia. Afridi to White, SIX runs Violent thump! White is turning it on here. Again he went down on his knee, again he went for the slog sweep to a delivery outside off,and again he connected superbly Abdur to Hussey, OUT Another twist. Another wicket. Pakistan keep the heat on. This one was flighted on the leg and middle and Hussey thought .. I will push it to midwicket and get a single and give the strike to White. Mistake. The ball was slower in pace, it grips and straightens and perhaps stops a touch on Afridi to Hussey, SIX runs The drama continues here at St Lucia. Immense fun. Another short delivery from Afridi which is a surprise. Another fab pull shot from Hussey which is not a surprise. The game remains alive. Amir to White, OUT Is this the moment of the chase? And would you believe it, it was a full toss that did the trick for Pakistan. A full toss on the off stump line. White's eyes opens up and he tries to smash it through the line to long-off. Perhaps that was the mistake. He couldn't find enough power behind it Ajmal to Smith, OUT Ajmal can be such a difficult bowler to get away in these circumstances. Those tantalizing doosras. It landed on the middle stump line, Smith was down the track and actually tried to loft it over the off-side which perhaps indicates that he thought it might be the doosra. But no wood on leat Ajmal to Hussey, SIX runs Ajmal drifts to the leg side and Hussey jumps at the opportunity. He was well inside the crease and swings it over backward square-leg boundary Ajmal to Hussey, 1 leg bye full delivery, Hussey tries to heave it to the on side but doesn't connect. A leg bye will give him the strike though And that's it from us. Thanks for logging on. Good bye and good luck. Hussey let out a roar of joy as he hit that shot. Waqar Younis hung his head down.

And with one ball to go, they pulled off an astonishing chase of 192 to enter Sunday's final, leaving on Pakistan the deepest kind of scars in an already abusive relationship.

"Hello and welcome to the last match of the Super Eights. It's West Indies and Australia in St Lucia, and the news from the middle is West Indies have won the toss and elected to bat. Nannes to Gayle, OUT oh dear! He's gone! Angled in and this ball doesn't swing at all, and rattles Gayle's stumps. The ball jagged back a little off the seam, Gayle has played the wrong line. Johnson to Sarwan, 1 leg bye pushes a single to the off side Johnson to Sarwan, OUT oh, that's extremely unfortunate. What a shocking piece of luck for Dwayne Bravo. Sarwan drives fast and straight - too straight - as the ball clips Johnson's fingers and rockets into the stumps at the non-striker's end with Bravo backing up out of his ground Smith to Deonarine, OUT Deonarine's inclusion hasn't helped West Indies, he's gone for the glory shot over deep midwicket but straight to the man on the boundary Johnson to Ramdin, 1 wide wrong line from Johnson this time, down leg and called wide Johnson to Ramdin, OUT gone, straightforward dismissal with a ball angled across Ramdin, who looks to dab the ball away and simply gets a thick edge behind Clarke to Pollard, SIX runs and this time Pollard goes for it, he's got down on one knee to slog sweep, he had no intention of keeping that ball down and lifted it high over midwicket for six Hussey to Sarwan, OUT and it goes from bad to worse for West Indies. Sarwan, the last of the specialist batsmen, has tried to clear the boundary at long-off but has simply found the man in the deep Hussey to Taylor, OUT two wickets in the over for Dave Hussey, Taylor goes for a big swipe and gets a thickish edge that is taken at gully Smith to Pollard, OUT gone! Lovely piece of bowling from Smith, he's turned the ball just past the bat of Pollard, who is trying to get forward and work through leg, and Haddin whips the bails off, no need for the third umpire there Smith to Sammy, OUT first ball! Smith is on a hat-trick! Tossed up on leg and turning back to off, Sammy has gone for the drive but straight back to the bowler, who takes a good catch Watson to Benn, OUT gone, and that's the end of the innings. Watson goes full and straight and Benn can't get bat on that, it rattles his stumps So, West Indies have failed to bat out their overs and have crawled to 105. They need a miracle, now, to get through to the semi-finals. Steven Smith and Mitchell Johnson bowled really well, and of course Dirk Nannes got the all-important wicket of Chris Gayle in the first over. Australia will chase 106 - join us shortly for their reply. Australia are about to start their chase - they cannot be knocked out now. West Indies need to keep Australia to 81 to progress. Here's Jerome Taylor Taylor to Warner, SIX runs that is a massive six! Really big one from Warner, who gets a half-volley and simply launches a baseball-style slog straight back over the bowler's head and it lands on the roof of the pavilion Taylor to Hussey, 5 wide well, how that has reached the boundary is a mystery. It was a shortish ball that Hussey back away from, and somehow it's dipped on Ramdin and bounced under his gloves and away to the boundary That's it from this match, and from the Super Eights. Thanks for joining us - be sure to tune in again for the two semi-finals, England v Sri Lanka on Thursday and Australia v Pakistan on Friday. Until then, bye for now. So that's the end of the Super Eights and it's the end of West Indies' tournament. Australia have won by six wickets and have finished on the top of Group F. They will meet Pakistan in one semi-final and Sri Lanka will meet England in the other.

The hosts were in trouble as soon as the captain Chris Gayle fell second ball and flopped to 105, which their unbeaten opponents eased past in 16.2 overs. Australia's next engagement is Friday's semi-final against Pakistan while Sri Lanka, who qualified in the first game of the day in St Lucia, face England on Thursday. Sri Lanka's five-wicket victory over India left West Indies needing to win by 24 runs to reach the last four ahead of Kumar Sangakkara's side, but that quickly proved impossible."
"Australia have won the toss and have opted to field Hazlewood to Soumya, 1 wide loose delivery down leg, wide called. Bit of zip though to the keeper Zampa to Mohammad Naim, OUT what a way to get out! Premeditates to play the reverse sweep, Zampa goes absolutely full on middle stump. Misses the shot, ball goes under the bat, and the stumps have been broken. A promising innings over with a shot he'd like to forget Agar to Shakib, 1 leg bye full on leg, and turning in. Shakib comes down the wicket to flick. Misses, hits the pad and rolls away to the off side Hazlewood to Shakib, OUT dragged on!

Yorker-length, late reverse in to beat the inside edge as Afif looks to slog this into the stands. Welcome back to the chase. Australia favourites to take the 1-0 lead, unless the spinners make a web around them and the two left-arm seamers can make some impact up front. Alex Carey and Josh Philippe are out there. We'll start with offspin, however, here's Mahedi Hasan. Shakib to Wade, 1 wide good length, on middle and leg. Turning further down the leg side. Wide given Shoriful Islam to Marsh, 1 leg bye back of a length, on middle. Misses the pull, hits his body and rolls away to the off side.

Australia had the upper hand at the halfway mark but the dismissal of Alex Carey first ball, followed by two more batters by the third over, meant that they had their backs to the wall early on. After that, though Mitchell Marsh tried to keep Australia in the contest with a patient run-a-ball 45 from No. 3, wickets at regular intervals left them 23 short in the end. Bangladesh used spin right from the first ball."
"Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 wide fired down the leg side again and it's called wide Maxwell to S Dhawan, 1 wide fired again down the leg side and Dhawan misses out trying to slap it fine but it's a wide Hazlewood to S Dhawan, (no ball) No-ball for overstepping 137kph, Dhawan charges and moves leg side, Hazlewood pitches back of a length and wide of off, Dhawan leaves Abbott to S Dhawan, OUT chipped to cover! 132kph, good length, Dhawan advanced down the track to try and create a half-volley, he got there but played a strange shot, just checking a drive to Agar at cover, it was almost like he was giving catching pract Hazlewood to Gill, 1 wide 134kph, angled down the leg side and called wide Hazlewood to Gill, SIX runs top edge flies into the crowd at fine leg! It was a short ball into the ribs, he tried to control a pull shot, got a thick top edge and it flew way over the head of fine leg and was caught 8 rows back Agar to Gill, OUT Given lbw! Gill takes his time but he finally reviews. Gill tried to sweep a delivery that pitched on off and slid on, it hit the front pad a fair way down and the umpire gave it out. Nothing on hot spot or RTS in terms of bat involved Zampa to Iyer, OUT gone! Iyer was looking to force the pace there, trying to reverse some of the momentum Australia have built with these quiet overs. Full and quickish, on the stumps, and Iyer looks to make room to drive through - or maybe over - the c Agar to Rahul, OUT gone, that's not a good shot at all. It's quite full, it's on the stumps, and it's hugely risky to try and sweep those balls. This one passes under his bat, and he's been given out lbw. He's reviewed... Only bounce can save him, I thi Hazlewood to Kohli, OUT ooh, Australia have reviewed for a caught-behind! Back of a length, straightening just a touch in the corridor. Kohli is looking initially to work this with the angle, I think, and then he's adjusting to the movement when the bal Abbott to Hardik, SIX runs upper cut over point! Sensational shot. Short outside off, he backed away, gave himself room and slapped it up and over point into the dug out It was the third-best 6th wicket partnership for India in ODI cricket . Natarajan to Finch, SIX runs drops short now, and it only gets up to about stomach height, just outside off. Finch swivels and dumps it over the forward square leg boundary. Welcome to international cricket! Natarajan to Labuschagne, OUT Natarajan on the board. India's first wicket in Powerplays this series. What a moment for Natarajan. Not the most spectacular one. Not something you see when you dream of a maiden wicket. This is short, just outside off, Mar Natarajan to Finch, 1 leg bye length ball angling into the stumps. Half-hearted appeal as Finch walks across to flick and misses. The impact, again, was outside off stump. Ball ricochets wide of slip for a leg-bye Thakur to Smith, OUT got him! No 62-ball hundred today for Smith. Not the most aesthetically pleasing dismissal, but Thakur won't care. Back of a length, angling down leg, and Smith, who's shuffled a long way across as he always does, looks to glance it Thakur to Henriques, OUT caught at midwicket! A pull shot picks out Dhawan! Back of a length, cross seam, similar to one in the previous over that he nailed, but this one he hit knee high to Dhawan. Big wicket Jadeja to Finch, OUT holes out to long on! The dot balls on Green has built the pressure on Finch and he holes out> He's tried to launch this down the ground, he miscued to Dhawan at long on and he nearly spilled it but was able to hold on rolling to th Kuldeep to Green, OUT caught at deep backward square! Superb catch by Jadeja! Full outside leg, he sweeps in the air, flat behind square, it curved in the air, Jadeja ran in from well behind square and took an excellent catch diving forward. Green depar Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide 138kph angled down leg and it's called wide! They appealed for caught behind. It certainly looked like it came off the thigh guard Jadeja to Maxwell, SIX runs bang. The open stance allows him easier access to this sort of line. Length ball, angling into middle stump or so, and he gets forward, head over the ball, and absolutely shovels it over the midwicket boundary with super quic Thakur to Carey, 1 leg bye length ball, looks to work it into the leg side and misses. Aborted lbw appeal because it pitched outside leg Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide big wide down the leg side. Wanted to angle it into his feet and deny him room Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide slower bouncer again, over off stump, and Maxwell thinks of playing the ramp to third man, then decides to leave it. It's called wide anyway Bumrah to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to follow up with the leg-stump yorker, and he misses his mark by inches. Maxwell looked to step across and help it fine, and couldn't put bat to it Bumrah to Maxwell, OUT bam, the bails go flying all over the place. That elastic right arm goes beyond the vertical and whangs it full and fast, at the base of the stumps. Maxwell looks to make room and carve it through the covers, working against the a Thakur to Abbott, OUT slower bouncer, and Thakur has the breakthrough. Third wicket for him. Gets up just around shoulder height, angling in and cramping Abbott for room, and he plays a half-hearted pull, only managing to lob it to the keeper off his gl Natarajan to Agar, OUT and he gets the last recognised batsman! Boundaries were needed, and this ball - more or less in the slot, off-stumpish - had to be attacked. Made room to go over cover, but he simply couldn't find the elevation, and the fielder p Bumrah to Zampa, OUT big appeal for lbw, given. Zampa shuffles across and Bumrah bowls it full and straight. He misses the flick, and it looked pretty plumb, given especially how deep he was in his crease, but Zampa has reviewed anyway. No edge on it. B 10.28pm A dead rubber, but they're often really entertaining. Today's game had so much packed into it, and in the end, the most significant bit of the action was an outstanding sixth-wicket partnership between Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja, which hauled In 10.46pm Right then, that's all from us from this ODI series. We hope you've enjoyed it as much as we did. The T20Is will begin soon, and there's a whole lot of other cricket going on around the world right now too (I wonder if this would have seemed possible s Player of the match is Hardik Pandya, INDIA","India 5 for 302 (Pandya 92*, Jadeja 66*, Kohli 63, Agar 2-44) beat Australia 289 (Finch 75, Maxwell 59, Thakur 3-51, Bumrah 2-43) by 13 runs India were five down in 32 overs, staring at a below-par total, and with that a series clean sweep, when Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja came together to nearly double their then score of 152, which turned out to be just enough thanks to a gun spell from Jasprit Bumrah in the end. Pandya ended up with a career-best unbeaten 92 off 76, and Jadeja doubled up his 50-ball 66 with the wicket of a set Aaron Finch and a smart low catch in the field. Australia's chase went similar to India's innings - the fourth wickets fell at the exact same point, 123 in 25.3 overs - but the hosts kept losing wickets to fall short by 13 runs. The pitch wasn't as flat as was expected when India won the toss, and it showed in how they managed to successfully defend what was only the third-highest total in a full-length ODI at this heavy-scoring ground."
"Time for the toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat. They are unchanged. Sangakkara says he would have batted first. Three changes for Sri Lanka. Dinesh Chandimal, Chanaka Welegedera and Suraj Randiv come in. No Kulasekara or Perera, and of course no Murali, for he's gone back home after aggravating his groin injury. Angelo Mathews to Watson, OUT bowled'im! Played it on, lands on a good length just outside off stump and there is a hint of inward movement, Watson got forward, tried to defend it into the off side, got an inside edge to rattle the stumps Welegedara to Warner, 1 wide slides it down the leg side to begin with, Warner fails to make contact, called a wide Angelo Mathews to Haddin, OUT that was unneccessary, change of pace this time, a slower one bowled on a length on the off stump, Haddin was targeting the deep midwicket boundary, was early into the shot, ended up getting a leading edge and the ball landed safely into the palms of the only MP playing international cricket Welegedara to Warner, 1 leg bye drifting on the pads and Warner misses out while trying to drive it through midwicket, is hit on the pads and he sneaks a leg bye Randiv to Warner, OUT brilliantly taken! Excellent reflexes from Jayawardene at slip, it's tossed up a hint this time and Warner's eyes lit up, tried to blaze it through the off side, the ball turned away to take the outside edge and Jayawardene, among the best slip fielders in the game, reacted superbly to snap it moving to his right Randiv to Hussey, OUT another one goes! Randiv's on a hat-trick. Failed to pick the straighter one, flighted outside off stump, Hussey turned the face to play it through midwicket, stepped out of the crease, missed and Sangakkara did the rest Randiv to Clarke, OUT Randiv's super day continues, Clarke makes room to cut, he misses and the off bail is on the floor, there's some confusion whether the ball hit stumps or whether it was the keeper's gloves that dislodged the bail, replays show the ball hit the top of offstump, and Clarke has to go Nannes to Jayasuriya, 1 leg bye shortish on the off, nips in just a touch, strikes him high on the thighs as he tries to turn the face Tait to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide short and wide, slashes hard at that one, misses, would be disappointed he missed out there, but he'll take the wide Nannes to Mahela Jayawardene, SIX runs picked the length early and cleared the ropes with ease, fraction short on middle and leg, swivelled and pulled it handsomely over deep square leg Smith to Kapugedera, 1 leg bye fullish on middle and leg, comes down the track and tries to drive it through midwicket, clips the pads and rolls into the leg side Australia, looking unstoppable this tournament, have more or less qualified for the semis with this comprehensive win. Their top order had been blown away during their innings but Cameron White stepped to score an unbeaten 85 to revive his team. Their bowlers were ruthless, chipping away constantly to ensure there remained no hope for Sri Lanka.

Dirk Nannes and Mitchell Johnson were the main destroyers of the Sri Lankan batting line-up, but the win was made possible by Cameron White's unstoppable 85 from 49 balls, which rescued his side from a perilous 67 for 5. White was ably aided by Michael Hussey in an unbroken stand of 101 in less than ten overs, and when the Sri Lankan top order was bullied out by a formidable Australian pace attack in quick succession, the rest of the batsmen collapsed in a heap. Australia had been in a similar situation against Bangladesh in the group stage, sinking to 65 for 6 before they were saved by a 74-run partnership between Hussey and Steven Smith. Today, they had White to thank, as he saw off the threatening Suraj Randiv, making the most of a missed chance on 23 to establish his dominance over the rest of the attack, as he passed 50 from 32 balls."
"Khan to Watson, SIX runs clearing the ropes comfortably here, confident shot, bowled on a good length, made room and swung it over long-on Jadeja to Warner, SIX runs five consecutive sixes off Jadeja, tossed it up, came down the track and chipped it into that gap between long-on and deep midwicket, timed it well enough to clear the ropes Pathan to Watson, SIX runs Watson gets to his fifty in style, another long hop, short outside off and it's hammered over deep midwicket Pathan to Watson, OUT gone, kept a little low, didn't bounce as much as he wanted to, short of a good length and he tried to repeat the shot from the previous ball, missed and was bowled Nehra to Hussey, SIX runs banged it short outside off, looked a little off balanced when he struck that but he managed to smear it over deep midwicket, a flat six Yuvraj to Warner, OUT India will be relieved, short outside off, much quicker, tries to crash it hard through the off side, some extra bounce there, gets an edge and Dhoni snaps it, no doubt in the umpire's mind, that was out Yuvraj to Haddin, OUT stumped, gets some turn, lands on a good length, Haddin steps out of the crease and tries to clear extra cover, misses as it spins away and Dhoni does the rest Nehra to Hussey, OUT slower one again, bowled on a length on middle and he didn't appear to pick it, tried to clear long-on but failed, Vijay took it comfortably a few yards inside the ropes Khan to Hussey, 1 wide short, slow and too wide, called by the umpire Nehra to Hussey, OUT yorker and the leg stump is knocked out, superb bowling from Nehra this final over, in the blockhole, Hussey tries to cart it through midwicket, misses and is bowled Nannes to Vijay, OUT Vijay gets the leading edge and is caught, got to him quick, short of a good length outside off and he tried to turn the face and gifted a simple catch to White at cover, it was angling away and he chose the wrong shot Nannes to Gambhir, OUT gone! Gambhir mistimes again and finds the fielder, 146 kmph and it was quicker than he might have liked, shaped up to play the pull, gets it high on the bat and it lobs up straight towards midwicket Tait to Raina, 1 wide bouncer banged in on middle, Raina ducks, it's too high and is called a wide Nannes to Yuvraj, OUT bowled'im! Aiming for the blockhole and gets it right, sliding on leg stump, Yuvraj tries to work it through the leg side, misses, it clips the pads and brushes the off stump to leave India in further trouble Johnson to Harbhajan, 1 leg bye tries to force it through the on side, is struck on the thigh, Rohit calls for a single and Harbhajan responds Smith to Harbhajan, 2 wide sliding it down the leg side, tries to sweep it fine, misses Smith to Khan, SIX runs another six, all of which will help India if it comes down to net run-rate, Zaheer bends his knee and plonks the ball over wide long-on Tait to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide fast and wide down the leg side India have been completely outplayed today, with Rohit Sharma and Harbhajan Singh being their only saving grace.

Silence before a storm that absolutely blew India out of its way. Six-hitting has seldom been made to look easier: David Warner and Shane Watson just kept clearing their front legs, creating room, and kept lofting the Indians over various parts of the Kensington Oval. Finding gaps and all they didn't care about. Between them they hit 13 sixes and only three fours, and by the time they were done, 142 runs had been scored in 14 overs."
"Shafiul to Watson, 1 wide slides down the leg side for the first wide of the day Mortaza to Watson, OUT Watto's gotta go! Mashrafe bowled a great first over, and now gets his reward with a very well-directed bouncer. That was fast and directed at Watto's body, he was hustled into the pull and was quite late on it. The top edge went high and when it came down, it landed in the hands of Aftab Ahmed who took a good tumbling catch. Razzak to Haddin, OUT gotcha! Do we have an upset brewing here! Haddin plays an airy-fairy lofted sweep over square leg, just that he was no where near the pitch of the ball and ended up top-edging a dolly to short third man Ashraful to Hussey, 1 wide slips down the leg for a wide Ashraful to Clarke, OUT the skipper is gone! Australia are stuttering here, and Clarke's played an unnecessary shot to give his wicket away. Pitched up on off stump, Clarke was out of his crease and looked to loft it over long off, but did not hit it well enough to clear the ropes. It went straight to the fielder in the outfield Shakib to White, OUT See you later Mr. White! Lovely bit of left-arm spin bowling from Shakib, White tried to double guess him by moving to the leg side, Shakib stuck to his guns and bowled the stock ball on leg and middle, it turned away and beat White's attempted prod to crash into the furniture! Mortaza to Hussey, SIX runs Incredible timing! Full toss on leg stump, but they still have to be out away. Hussey stood his ground and flicked it nonchalantly over square leg for a six Razzak to Smith, SIX runs Butchered! Shorter boundary on the leg side, and Smith went for it, with the expansive hoick over midwicket. Times perfectly Lots to watch out for - should be an interesting chase. Tait to Shakib, 1 wide very wide outside off and this time it is called a wide Tait to Shakib, 1 wide very short and again very wide, this time down the leg side. Tait not so tight this over Tait to Mushfiqur, 1 wide ooh, pacy outside off, that exploded after pitching and carried at good height to Haddin, Rahim was a day late on his square cut Smith to Shakib, OUT Mr. Cricket earns his side a big wicket! Pitched up and Shakib swings it away high behind square, but there was a hint of top edge as it looped towards deep square leg. Hussey initially misjudged it and ran too far inside, but reassessed in time, to back-pedal and dive full stretch to his back and pluck it a few metres inside the ropes! Hussey to Md Naeem, SIX runs Naeem lofts a big six! Offie spinning into him, he went down on a knee and slog swept it cleanly over long on Two games against top sides, and on both occasions, Bangladesh had more than their share of moments. Yet, on both occasions, they have been let down badly by one discipline - it was the bowling against Pakistan, and today, though the bowlers lost their mojo towards the end, one has to blame the batsmen for this debacle. Australia have eventually wrapped this up comfortably, but going into the next round, they will be Player of the match is Michael Hussey, AUS","Australia 141 for 7 (M Hussey 47*, Smith 27) beat Bangladesh (Shakib 28, Nannes 4-18) by 27 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Dirk Nannes had the best figures by an Australian bowler in Twenty20s AFP Michael Hussey reprised his favourite role, of the rescue artist, to steer Australia to a competitive total before Dirk Nannes' pace and some world-class fielding confirmed there would be no repeat of last year's embarrassing first round World Twenty20 exit. Bangladesh's defeat also meant defending champions Pakistan, the team most likely to take the flight home in case Group A was decided on net run-rate, also progressed to the Super Eights. Bangladesh were dreaming of another famous upset in a global tournament in the Caribbean after their armada of spinners thrived on a pitch with bounce and turn at the Kensington Oval to cut Australia to 65 for 6. The slow bowlers had been so effective that there had been no boundaries for more than ten overs after Michael Clarke got off the mark with a lovely hit over long-off in the fourth over, before Hussey and Steven Smith pounded 74 runs to push Australia to 141. Playing with typical Australian resilience, Hussey and Smith more than doubled the total in the final seven overs."
"Anyway, enough tattle, we have news from the middle. Australia have won the toss and will bat first. The teams line-up like this: Sami to Warner, OUT gone this time! Sami strikes! That is massive relief for Pakistan, things were looking out of hand, but this was dug in a touch short, Warner tried to pull but could only top-edge it down to Umar Akmal, who made no mistake on the square leg boundary Hafeez to Clarke, OUT gone! Real bonus for Hafeez and Pakistan! Quicker ball, Clarke gave himself room to try and cut it away, but it zipped through and castled middle stump Sami to Hussey, 1 wide slower ball and wide outside off stump, too wide for the batsman or umpire Sami to Hussey, SIX runs another one! Full this time, into Hussey's hitting arc and he just threw his hands though it, clean strike, another six Ajmal to Hussey, OUT finally, some peace for Pakistan. Hussey departs, he tried to mow this away into the leg side again, but finally finds a fielder who can catch, Fawad Alam makes no mistake on the boundary Ajmal to Watson, OUT good ball from Saeed Ajmal sees the end of Watson! Quicker ball and flat and full, Watson looking to unleash another huge leg-side swipe, misses and is struck bang in front. Brings the end to a brilliant knock Ajmal to White, OUT nicely done from Saeed Ajmal, holding it back, White tried to get it away but could only heave it to the square leg boundary where Fawad Alam takes the catch Amir to Haddin, OUT gone! No mistake from Sami at short third man, it was full and outside off, Haddin throws his hands at it, gets an edge and neatly taken. Dot ball is what matters at this stage, but the total is already imposing Amir to Johnson, OUT Aamer strikes! Lovely yorker and Johnson can't get his bat down in time, it crashes into middle stump, lovely bowling What an amusing end to a very destructive Australia innings. Before those five wickets in six balls Australia ran rampant, first Watson and then David Hussey powering the ball around mercilessly. It would take something quite special for Pakistan to climb this mountain. Nannes to Kamran, OUT well, you get a sense this could fizzle out too quickly, Pakistan need almost 10 an over, this is full outside off, Akmal clears his front leg and slices it away off the outside edge down to Steve Smith on the third man boundary, who snaffles it easily enough Tait to Salman Butt, 1 wide Tait is into the action and launches a sharp, vicious bouncer that whizzes past Butt's ear, sadly a wide in this format Tait to Hafeez, 1 wide oops, slower ball that slips out of Tait's hands at beamer height, but it is harmless and down the leg side Tait to Salman Butt, OUT Tait strikes this time! Similar to the last ball, Butt trying to give himself room, Tait follows him with a bouncer, the attempted pull this time gets high on the bat and loops gently to Hussey at mid on, Pakistan in real trouble Clarke to Misbah, SIX runs gets all of this! Misbah swings his arms through the line of the ball and nails it over midwicket for six! Smith to Umar Akmal, 1 wide another attempted dab shot, to what would have been a full toss, so Umar ends up getting nothing from a loose ball Watson to Afridi, 1 leg bye Afridi down on one knee again, this is well outside off stump though, so the leg-side scoop is harder to pull off, as it is, it comes off the boot into the off side where Haddin fields Australia came into this tournament with a very poor record but they have outplayed the defending champions in every aspect of the game today. Led by an excellent innings from Shane Watson, supported by the destructive Davids - Warner and Hussey, they made too many for a Pakistan team out of sorts. Player of the match is Shane Watson, AUS","Australia 191 (Watson 81, D Hussey 53, Aamer 3-23) beat Pakistan 157 (Misbah 41, Tait 3-20, Nannes 3-41) by 34 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out David Hussey and Shane Watson's 98-run association set up a score which proved too much for Pakistan AFP Australia began to right previous wrongs in this format with an emphatic dismantling of the defending champions at St Lucia, a 34-run win serving serious notice to one and all of their intentions in this tournament. They wear a fresh look about them in this tournament, under a new captain in Michael Clarke at a global event for the first time since 1999 and with some very handy specialists in the squad. They went about their opening game in merciless fashion, echoing their dominance over Pakistan months earlier. Brutal half-centuries from Shane Watson and David Hussey set them up, before equally brutal pace shoved aside Pakistan's batsmen. That the loss was Pakistan's tenth international in a row to Australia is neither here nor there; more relevant, Australia were very hot and Pakistan very cold."
"12.35pm England have won the toss and will field. England go in with an unchanged team and adopt and unchanged gameplan. Australia too are unchanged and Ponting, flinty-eyed as ever, understandably wants to see more from his batsmen. Anderson to Paine, 1 wide Anderson searches for an inswinger and duly fires it down leg for a wide Broad to Paine, 1 bye well done the pitch! Oval bounce here, it was a touch short and leapt up, over Paine's cut shot and carried on climbing, eventually bursting through Kieswetter's gloves Bresnan to Paine, OUT all over for Paine! He's struggled today and it was a tame end. He tried to work it into the leg side, got a leading edge and looped very gently to Morgan at cover. Bresnan has his first wicket in the series Bresnan to Ponting, 1 wide responds with a bouncer which is too short according to the umpire so he'll have to bowl that again Swann to Watson, OUT gone! Would you believe it, Watson has picked out deep midwicket with absolute precision as he went for a slog sweep. Eoin Morgan barely had to take step and Watson can barely drag himself away...he's been i Broad to Clarke, 1 wide banged in short and it flies down the leg side which makes it an easy call for the umpire PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 wide down the leg side, well taken by Kieswetter Broad to White, OUT gone this time! White couldn't quite going and here he tried to smash a short ball out the ground, couldn't get much of it and Anderson took an easy catch on the square leg boundary Anderson to Clarke, 2 wide oops! This must have just got stuck in Anderson's hands, it was so, so short, almost pitched on the bowler's feet, looped up miles over the batman, with enough time to collect a bye as well Tait to Strauss, 1 wide pace to start, but not much direction as he sprays one very wide of off stump from over the wicket Tait to Strauss, 1 leg bye back of a length and very sharp. Strauss shapes to tuck the ball to leg but can't quite get it away, but Kieswetter calls him through for a quick single straight away Harris to Kieswetter, OUT clatter! Harris sent one down much fuller and Kieswetter went for the drive, leaving an enormous gap between bat and pad. There was a touch of wobble on the ball, and some seam movement in after pitching Tait to Strauss, OUT edged and gone! Well, that curved away from Strauss very late to take the edge of his bat, and Paine takes a regulation catch behind. Tait strikes, and Australia continue to chip away at England as they chas Hopes to Morgan, 1 leg bye once again Morgan looking for the leg-side whip, but can't connect and it thuds off the pads for a single Smith to PD Collingwood, OUT great response from Smith and Collingwood has gone! Top stuff from Smith, but Collingwood looks unlucky here, he pushed forward to defend and the ball rapped him on the front pad, looked outside the Hopes to Yardy, 1 bye nicely bowled from Hopes, a touch slower outside off and Yardy was through his drive too quickly, Paine, standing up to the stumps, couldn't collect cleanly, so they stole a bye Harris to Morgan, OUT the bowling change works and Morgan has gone! That could well be it! Harris has made the difference today, and this was full and outside off stump, inviting the flashing drive, but Morgan could only get a f Smith to Wright, OUT bowled round his legs! Smith has been getting really nice drift, and this has just curved slightly down the leg side and then spun back across to strike the middle and leg stumps. Wright tried to clip to leg Harris to Bresnan, OUT Harris strikes again, what a game he's having! Bresnan attempted to clear the one man at deep long on, curious shot-selection really, and he ended up skiing it straight to Watson on the boundary Bollinger to Swann, OUT and another one goes! Bollinger is too sharp for Swann! Bounced up into the rib area, Swann tried to fend it away and could only glove it behind to Paine Bollinger to Broad, 1 leg bye almost goes first ball as Bollinger, who is really racing in, arrows a yorker into Broad's pads, it was slipping down leg, however, and thudded off the pads for one No whitewash for England, they never got close today. Ponting and Clarke finally gave the Australian bowlers something to work with, and England, chasing a daunting total, could never get going as Harris ran through the top order. Player of the match is Ryan Harris, AUS","Australia 290 for 5 (Clarke 99*, Ponting 92) beat England 212 (Yardy 57, Harris 5-32) by 78 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Michael Clarke top scored with 99 not out as Australia's batsmen fired them to 290 Getty Images There will be no clean-sweep for England. It was too late to save the series but Australia's batsmen, led by Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting, finally delivered a total their bowlers could defend at The Oval. Ryan Harris did just that, with five wickets and a Man-of-the-Match award, that handed England a 78-run defeat and offset any disappointment for Clarke, who earlier had been stranded on 99 in setting up Australia's 290 for 5. Australia's win will restore a little pride for the visitors, but mostly they will be pleased that a 0-5 result is no longer possible. England's eight-game winning streak, stretching back to their tour of South Africa in November, ended with a bowling display that was just slightly off the mark, and Australia's underperforming batsmen seized their opportunity."
"10.15am This series has certainly been a role reversal from last year with England dominating both contests so far and Australia desperately needing some inspiration. The visitors have a heap of injury problems, the latest being Nathan Hauritz who has flown home and Sha Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide a bit of a nothing delivery, slipping down leg Bresnan to Paine, 1 wide banged in short, too short. Broad to Clarke, 1 wide there we go, the expected bouncer, but it's too short and going down the leg side Swann to White, OUT swept, and snaffled at square leg! A full-blooded stroke, but Strauss scoops the ball low to his left, and that's a key wicket! Swann to Clarke, OUT oh dear, that was out from the moment he went through with the stroke. Done in the flight, and Clarke's uppish drive picks out the sub, Ian Bell, at long-off. PD Collingwood to Hussey, OUT gone and another one departs...Collingwood strikes with an off cutter that scoots through on off stump and beats Hussey's push. That had been coming. Anderson to Hopes, OUT gone! Anderson strikes with a slower ball which was back of a length and makes Hopes play the pull far too early, resulting in an under edge onto off stump...now it's down to the bowlers Broad to Harris, OUT and that's why it's all short, because it works, as Harris splices an attempted pull and lobs a simple catch Strauss at midwicket who has been in the action today Anderson to Smith, OUT another goes! Anderson gets his second as Smith goes for a sweep and is taken on the heel of his back foot which looked in line with leg stump Anderson to Bollinger, OUT all over! Dead-eye yorker from Anderson as Bollinger backs away to try and go through the off side and the ball strikes bottom of middle. That is that. Meanwhile, how's this for a premonition of traumas to come. Germany victorious as England are undermined by penalties. And the Aussies, well they crashed out long ago. Yes, I'm talking about the European Grand Prix, which is live on ESPNF1 right now ... Tait to Strauss, 1 wide too much width on that one Tait to PD Collingwood, 1 wide down the leg-side Tait to PD Collingwood, 1 wide misdirected, down the leg-side Tait to PD Collingwood, 1 wide down the leg-side again. The radar's gone a touch here Bollinger to PD Collingwood, OUT Gone! The change works immediately as Collingwood pushes with no great certainty outside off and chops the ball onto his stumps. It was on a length, wobbling around just outside off and he just pushed his bat at it without convict Hopes to Morgan, SIX runs what a hit! Where did that come from? Morgan just wondered down the wicket, catching the ball on the half-volley and lifting it easily back over Hopes's head and several rows back into the crowd at long-off. Tait to Strauss, (no ball) ooh, that could've been nasty! This one slips out of the hand and ends up a beamer, but way outside off. Tait raises his hand in apology Tait to Morgan, 1 wide flung well wide of off stump, that's a big wide Tait to Swann, 1 bye play and miss outside off, a full ball swings past Swann's drive and Paine can't gather cleaning...Swann only realises late on there's a bye to be taken That just about wraps things up from us for today. Andrew Miller's bulletin will be ready shortly (he's had a bit of rewrite to do, I know that feeling) and if you want the latest from the football World Cup head over to ESPNsoccernet. Although England have wrapped up t England won by 1 wicket (with 5 balls remaining) Player of the match is Graeme Swann, ENG","England 214 for 9 (Strauss 87, Bollinger 3-20, Tait 3-28) beat Australia 212 (Watson 61, Swann 4-37, Anderson 3-22) by one wicket Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Tim Bresnan kept his cool to deliver a series win for England AFP The finale was clumsy and ungainly, and it came as scant consolation for the wider sporting public on a day when the nation's footballers were soundly thrashed by their own arch-enemies, Germany, but England's cricketers somehow held their nerve to wrap up an unassailable 3-0 lead with two matches to come in their ODI series against Australia. After Graeme Swann's 4 for 37 had limited the Aussies to an eminently gettable 212, England had at one stage been coasting to victory on 185 for 3 with eight-and-a-half overs in hand, but a sensational collapse of six wickets for 18 in 38 balls meant their victory bunting had been somewhat frayed around the edges by the time Tim Bresnan slashed two desperate boundaries in the space of three deliveries to seal a one-wicket victory with five balls to spare. The catalyst for the collapse was the dismissal of Eoin Morgan, England's star finisher from the first two games at the Rose Bowl and Cardiff. He had joined forces with his captain, Andrew Strauss, to take England to the brink of a thumping victory when he swatted a tame pull to midwicket off Steven Smith to give Australia a sniff of an opening. Seven balls later, and with his fourth ODI century there for the taking, Strauss edged Ryan Harris with 24 still needed from 44 balls, whereupon Luke Wright hoisted Smith to long-off for a third-ball duck."
"Early news is that Australia have won the toss and chosen to bat on what has a slightly fraught afternoon for them. Ryan Harris has been ruled out with a groin injury and is replaced by Steven Smith, while Clint McKay comes in for 19-year-old Josh Hazlewood Broad to Paine, OUT gone! That's a strangle down the leg side as Paine gets an edge trying to work the ball away and a simple catch to Kieswetter to give Broad his 100th ODI wicket...a timely breakthrough for England, just as Broad managed two days ago Broad to Ponting, OUT gone! Broad strikes again and it's the big wicket of Ponting. Back of a length from Broad and the Australia captain pushed forward outside off, getting a thick edge which carries at chest height to Kieswetter Broad to Clarke, OUT gone! The change works, another short ball from Broad, Clarke was up on his toes but couldn't control it, the ball balloons off the glove straight to Swann! He was put in an awkward position and the bottom hand came off the bat, easy catch to short leg Wright to Watson, OUT gone! The short ball works again! Watson had played so well until this shot - he went for an ungainly front-foot pull when he should have been back, the top edge rockets straight up, Kieswetter calls for it and takes a good, sliding catch. Australia pegged back once again, and after such a good start they're looking decidedly vulnerable Anderson to Hussey, 1 wide loosener to start, no great pace and he's slipped down leg to Hussey - rightly called wide Anderson to Hussey, OUT gone! Full and Anderson finds a hint of swing back in to the left-hander to beat an airy flick to leg and clatter into the stumps! Was that swing? He sent down a cross-seam delivery but the ball definitely jagged in to Hussey after pitching. Either way, he's gone and Australia are tottering now... Broad to Smith, OUT gone this time! Well, it was an energetic innings from Smith, but he's played too early at this one as he tried to pick the ball up over the leg side. The ball took the leading edge and looped up quite high but not very far, and Collingwood at cover takes an easy catch Bresnan to White, 1 wide very short indeed, this loops way over White and down the leg side too. That wasn't pretty, and immediately called wide So, Australia reach 239 for 7 in their 50. It looked like they were going to get a lot more than that in the first half hour today, but England picked up regular wickets after breaking the opening stand, and really Australia owe everything to Cameron White, who held the innings together to finish unbeaten on 86. Steven Smith deserves a mention too - he never really Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 wide oops, Bollinger has sprayed this one well wide of off Bollinger to Kieswetter, 1 wide yuck, another horrible squirty full toss that flies a long way wide of off McKay to Strauss, SIX runs and Strauss makes good use of the free hit, a juicy half-volley and the England captain frees his arms and launches it high over long-on for six McKay to Pietersen, 1 leg bye there's an lbw appeal in hope more than anything, it's angled a long way down leg and Pietersen gets a leg bye Smith to Pietersen, OUT what a catch! Pietersen came down the track and tried to hammer Smith away to midwicket again, but in the air this time. Ponting was in position close at midwicket but that looked to have cleared him ... until he leapt to pluck it out of the air one-handed. I think he even surprised himself with that one. Rolling back the years, Punte Hauritz to Morgan, 1 wide speared down the leg side from round the wicket, and that'll be a wide McKay to PD Collingwood, SIX runs errr, no, he can't - Collingwood walks at McKay and picks the ball up sweetly to lift it high over midwicket for six McKay to PD Collingwood, 1 leg bye strays onto the pads of Collingwood, who doesn't get it away properly Bollinger to PD Collingwood, OUT gone! Just when I was saying that the batsmen had settled in and Australia were without a strike bowler, Bollinger charges in and hits the stumps! The ball was outside off and Collingwood went for a leaden-footed pushed to the off side, little inside edge and into the stumps. Still, he's probably done enough to close down the Bollinger to Morgan, OUT gone! Test match bowling does for Eoin Morgan, as Bollinger spears one down back of a length just around off stump. The ball rose quite sharply off a length, took the edge near the shoulder of the bat, and went through to Paine. Great piece of bowling, do Australia have a sniff of an unlikely series-levelling win now? McKay to Swann, SIX runs what a shot! It's all over now, and in style! McKay dished up a half-volley on off stump and Swann just murdered it over long-off. The ball never got up high but went way over the rope, and Swann is pumping his fist! The crowd had been very vocal as England closed in on the win, and they're cheering now too. Well, two in two for England, and they've cantered to the win both times! There was a little stutter today towards the end, but England looked the slicker, more professional outfit throughout the day and the win is well-deserved. Australia are missing some firepower in the bowling department, and it's really showed in the first two games. Their bowlers are generall England won by 4 wickets (with 28 balls remaining) Player of the match is Stuart Broad, ENG","England 243 for 6 (Morgan 52, Strauss 51, Bollinger 3-46) beat Australia 239 for 7 (White 86*, Watson 57, Broad 4-44) by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Stuart Broad picked up four wickets and Australia struggled to recover from his early strikes PA Photos There was no Eoin Morgan-like standout this time, but England still cruised to a comfortable four-wicket win to take a 2-0 lead in the series. From Stuart Broad's three early wickets to an impressive Andrew Strauss half-century, to a coasting partnership from Paul Collingwood and Morgan to confirm the result, it was a thoroughly professional victory for the hosts. On a day when Australia installed a Labor prime minister born in Wales, the nation's cricketers laboured in Wales for no such reward. Cameron White ground out one of his least attractive half-centuries to drive Australia to 239 for 7 but that was never going to be enough on a surface that, while a little slow, was no minefield. The Australian batsmen struggled to time the ball and their innings was full of thick edges and jarring woody clunks."
"Broad to Watson, OUT Watto falls! Oh, he is utterly disconsolate as he walks off. Broad fired down a bumper, Watson was quickly into the pull - but perhaps too quick on the shot. The ball struck the leading edge - or possibly even the back of the bat - and looped ever so gently back towards Broad, who tumbled over in taking a good caught-and-bowled Broad to Ponting, 1 wide Broad digs one in short, and it's fairly quick, Ponting tucks under it and rises to see the umpire calling it wide, much to Broad's annoyance Wright to Paine, OUT gone this time! The mistake doesn't cost England as Luke Wright strikes. It was a touch slower, outside off, Paine aimed a cut shot but it found the inside edge, went on to his boot and on to the stumps Wright to Ponting, OUT How about that!? Ponting has gone! Really gifted his wicket away there, it was short and angling down the leg side, Ponting tried to help a routine pull shot on it's way, but got under the ball, sending it in the air towards fine leg, where Broad ran around to his right and slid to take an excellent catch with both hands. Massive breakthrough for England Anderson to White, OUT gone! Anderson changes ends and picks up a wicket, as White tries to force the ball through the covers off the back foot but gets an inside edge which cannons into his stumps! England continue to chip away at the Australian batting line-up, and a great deal now rests on Clarke and Hussey Yardy to Hussey, OUT the ball change, the drinks, and Michael Yardy have done the trick! Hussey has gone! Really nothing dismissal that, outside off, skidded on a touch with the newer ball perhaps, got a faint outside edge, and Hussey walked Yardy to Clarke, 1 wide oops, darted well down the leg side from Yardy and he'll have to bowl another Anderson to Hauritz, 1 leg bye comical stuff, Hauritz shuffles right across to off and sets himself for the scoop over the keeper. The ball was well wide of off though, he re-adjusted but knocked himself off his feet as he does so. Recovered in time to complete the single and keep the strike though Broad to Hauritz, OUT gone this time! Full toss on leg stump, and it's softly tapped straight to Strauss at mid off. He didn't even have to move! Still, Hauritz has done a good job So, Australia close on 267 for 7, which is a decent total and just about par on this pitch. Clarke did well to keep going when wickets fell, and played a role in the two biggest partnerships of the innings, for the fifth and sixth wickets with Hussey and Hopes. But he never really changed gear towards the end, and generally struggled to find the boundary. Six bowlers were used by England, and the stand-out performers were surely Yardy and Wright, the two allrounders, who generally kept Bollinger will open the bowling, left arm over the wicket, two slips in place. Righty, the players are out there, England need 268. Andrew Strauss will open alongside Craig Kieswetter and will Ricky Ponting go with Josh Hazlewood first up? Amusingly enough, despite the blazing sunshine, the floodlights are on. These people know nothing about carbon footprints clearly. Bollinger to Strauss, 1 wide ooop, Bollinger has got this all wrong. Quickish yes, but miles down the leg side Harris to Pietersen, 1 leg bye touch shorter this time, Pietersen tried to whip it away but it thudded into his hip and trickled away for a single to bring up the 50 Hazlewood to Wright, 1 wide Hazlewood trying to repeat the line, but goes a little too far outside off and Wright leaves it alone Brydon will have his bulletin ready shortly so do check that out, and for anyone who could be interested in that other sporting tournament, do check out our sister site ESPNSoccernet. England won by 4 wickets (with 24 balls remaining) Player of the match is Eoin Morgan, ENG","England 268 for 6 (Morgan 103*, Harris 3-42) beat Australia 267 for 7 (Clarke 87*) by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Eoin Morgan starred with his third one-day international century Getty Images It took England until the seventh and final ODI to beat Australia last year; nine months later, Eoin Morgan produced his best one-day international innings to ensure they would start the series on a high. Morgan's unbeaten 103 was the standout performance of the match, more authoritative than Michael Clarke's anchoring role for Australia, and it was enough to separate two sides that otherwise mirrored each other. Before this game, Morgan had passed 80 on five occasions in ODIs, but those efforts had come against Bangladesh, Canada, Scotland or Netherlands. Triple figures against Australia is another thing entirely. He drove England home with four overs to spare, by which time the only real point of interest was whether he had enough runs to play with to reach his hundred."

It was an ODI that was meant to be a warm-up for Ricky Ponting's side, but it was rightly treated as a full-scale international by Ireland and the highly-fancied visitors were almost embarrassed. The captain William Porterfield started the dramatic chase of Australia's 232 by blasting three fours off Ryan Harris' first over and he later pulled a six off Clint McKay during a frenetic 80-run opening partnership with Paul Stirling. It felt like a Twenty20 game but eventually turned into a more familiar exchange between the world's No.1-ranked team and one of the minnows."
"10.20am There's one notable farewell already underway at Galle, where Murali is holding sway. And there is another happening this week in Leeds, where Rudi Koertzen bows out after 108 Tests as an umpire. That puts him second in the all-time list, behind Steve Bucknor, on 128. Mohammad Asif to Katich, 1 leg bye takes the thigh pad backward of square on the leg side...Pakistan still seem keen to target the leg-stump to Katich Amir to Katich, OUT gone! A breakthrough for Pakistan and Katich plays for shuffling across the crease as he's caught on off stump with the ball angling towards middle and leg. A strength can often be a weakness and he'll always been danger if he misses the ball - he should have gone like that early at Lord's. Rudi ra Mohammad Asif to Watson, OUT gone! Another falls. Game on. Asif gets his line and length right, full on off stump with a hint of shape back in, Watson misses his drive and is caught right in front. Ian Gould quickly raises the finger, but Watson isn't happy and takes a while to leave Umar Gul to Clarke, OUT gone! Australia all over the shop as Clarke is cleaned up. Was the perfect full length and he drove all around it having played two wild shots previously. Gul has pitched the ball up and got rewards Mohammad Asif to Ponting, OUT gone! Again Ponting thrusts the left leg forward and swishes across the pad at a ball nipping back in to him. He's struck infront of middle and leg, huge appeal from bowler and fielders and that's out! A remarkable exhibition of the control of seam and swing from Asif, and Australia are Mohammad Asif to North, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw! Asif bends one back into the batsman's pads, but that's actually moved too much and also would've bounced over leg stump. Not given, and that's a good decision Umar Gul to Hussey, OUT Hussey goes! Gul strikes! He fired the ball full and straight, snaking it back into the batsman to strike him on the pad. Rudi's slow finger of death begins to rise, and Hussey's got to go. He's unlucky there, replays suggest the ball may have missed leg stump. But look at this, Australia are Umar Amin to North, OUT Amin strikes! North falls! Kamran holds a catch! Amin picks up his first Test wicket as he lands one on a length around off stump. North could have left that, but he pushed forward in defence and had to reach for the ball. A healthy edge, and Kamran takes a good catch diving to his left. North Amir to Smith, OUT Done him first ball! That's a beauty from Aamer, snaking back through bat and ball to smash into middle stump! Smith was angling through midwicket but the ball simply wasn't there Amir to Johnson, OUT Oh. My. Goodness. What a beauty from Aamer, that was unplayable, full on middle and off and it shaped away and took off stump. Aamer is on a hat-trick! Mohammad Asif to Paine, OUT and that, as they say, is that! A regulation outswinger, a loose leaning waft of a cut, a thin snick, and Kamran Akmal wraps up an outstanding effort from Pakistan by claiming the decisive catch Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, (no ball) and now he's over-stepped, looking for some extra life out of the pitch outside off but straining just a little too much Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, 1 leg bye pushed leg side with the angle again, Butt can't lay bat on the glance but gets a single to keep the strike Hilfenhaus to Salman Butt, OUT gone this time! Australia finally get the breakthrough as Hilfenhaus pitches the ball nice and full, finding significant swing back in to the left-hander. Butt shaped to whip through the leg side, but was done in by the swing and the wide angle from round the wicket. The ball snuck past Johnson to Umar Amin, 1 leg bye short ball on leg stump, Amim tries to flick it round the corner but it takes the thigh pad towards long leg Hilfenhaus to Umar Amin, OUT but now he's gone! Hilfenhaus sent down a well-directed bouncer, which Amin saw early and tried to duck underneath. But he left his bat poking straight up like a periscope, the ball struck the side of the bat and looped gently to square leg, and Amin's got to go. He was starting to look r Watson to Amir, OUT Watson on a hat-trick! Aamer gone first ball! Looks like a poor decision on replay but first up looked stone dead. Fullish as usual from Watson, swinging in and Aamer shouldered arms and watched in horror as the ball snaked back from outside off and crashed into his pads. Rudi gave him out quickly Watson to Umar Gul, OUT Bowled him! Watson strikes again - five wickets for him! Sensational stuff, this is inspiration to every senior Sunday-league player, Watson is doing nothing more than bowling full and straight, Gul plays all around it as it gently swings in a fraction, catches the inside edge and cannons on t Hilfenhaus to Mohammad Asif, OUT chaos! Who knows what is going on out there, not the Pakistan batmen that's for sure! It was full and a slower ball, Asif found a leading edge the looped agonisingly towards mid off, it landed short but Kaneria set off for a single, Asif sent him back but the throw came in and caught With the best part of two sessions remaining today, could we see a repeat of this? Given how Pakistan bowled first-up, I wouldn't entirely rule it out ... ps ... how is that match a full ten years old already? Useful little partnership for the final wicket there - in the end both teams will be fairly happy with how the Pakistan innings unfolded. Wickets are falling rapidly under the dank Headingley skies so Pakistan's 170 lead is plenty. That said, Australia know if they can build a lead of 100 in their second innings, it could b Innings Start Welcome back folks. Everything's set up for a cracking final session at Headingley, this is tense stuff. Australia were out warming up for almost the whole interval, they are well up for this.","Pakistan 258 (Watson 6-33) and 180 for 7 (Farhat 67, Azhar 51) beat Australia 88 and 349 (Smith 77, Clarke 76) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The moment of victory: Umar Gul and Mohammad Aamer scamper through for the winning run Getty Images Pakistan's long, long wait for a Test victory over Australia finally came to an end amid scenes of excruciating tension on the fourth morning at Headingley, as a simple equation of 40 runs for victory with seven wickets still standing was made to look as complex as the proof to Fermat's Last Theorem. They eventually crept home with three men still standing, but their collective nerves in tatters, as Umar Gul launched the winning shot through the covers with the scores already level. The margin of victory looked more comfortable than it felt, and that's putting it mildly. The eventual difference between the sides was the wicketkeeper, Kamran Akmal, whose 13 from 26 balls was as close as Pakistan came to a composed fourth-day performance. That said, had Akmal been given out caught in the gully with five runs still required, who knows what miracles might have transpired."
"Mohammad Asif to Clarke, OUT Asif strikes! The last ball before tea, and Pakistan really needed this! It was a touch fuller, pitched in line and jagged back down the slope, Clarke was beaten by the movement as he tried to defend and this time umpire Gould gives the decision. Touch unlucky Mohammad Asif to Katich, OUT gone! Asif gets another and it's a massive wicket. On off stump and late movement away from Katich which took the outside edge through to Kamran Akmal. A cracking ball. The previous one came back in, this one shaped away. Mohammad Asif to North, OUT gone! What a beauty from Asif and North goes without scoring. Swung back into the left hander who played a loose drive and the ball took off stump. Great sight for Pakistan Umar Gul to Paine, OUT gets this right though! Gul finally joins the paceman's party and Paine's tough debut innings is over! It was a touch quicker and it bounced a fraction more on Paine, moving away and clipping the outside edge through to Akmal, who made no mistake Danish Kaneria to Smith, OUT And Kaneria wins the battle straight away! Pitched in line, it was a topspinner that squeezed between bat and pad, stuck in front, but replays show Smith got a faint inside edge, so he's unlucky. Big wicket that! Danish Kaneria to Johnson, OUT lovely bowling! Really good to watch! The pressure built all over, Johnson had no idea what was going on, this was looped up outside off, Johnson aimed an airy drive and it spun back quickly through the gate on to the stumps Amir to Hilfenhaus, OUT the plan works! Aamer only needs one ball! It was full, swung back and through Hilfenhaus's defence to rattle off stump! Amir to Hussey, 1 wide very wide and called so by umpire Gould...Aamer was trying to keep Hussey off strike but he forced that delivery Amir to Bollinger, OUT not so well played! The perfect ball to a No. 11. A full inswinging yorker, clatters the pads, ricochets into the stumps, and Australia's first innings is over! So, a valuable late contribution from Bollinger, who helped Hussey add 31 for the last wicket. Will 253 be a par score? It might well be, if Australia use the conditions with anything like the same skill. Don't go away, unless it's to boil the kettle. We're all for that sort of behaviour. Watson to Kamran, OUT gone! Now Watson has two, what a turn up this is. And Kamran didn't even play a shot! He completely misjudged the line and went to pad up, but the ball was heading straight for middle and off. By the time he realised it was too late and Rudi Koertzen's slow finger wa Watson to Afridi, SIX runs that's massive! Full on off stump and Afridi drives this monstrously over mid-off. Don't think it even came quite out of the middle, but cleared the rope with ease. What a counterattack. Watson to Afridi, OUT and Watson's figures have just got even crazier! He's picked up Afridi, and I guess it was bound to happen but what a shame. It was on off stump again and he tried to repeat his drive for six, but didn't connect cleanly and slotted it straight up in the air where Joh So Australia earn themselves a sizeable lead of 105 and Pakistan couldn't even bat the length of a one-day innings. Pretty disappointing effort from them, apart from Salman Butt, although the top order is quite inexperienced. Watson was good, he found some swing both ways, but the tone was set b Innings Start Hilfenhaus is changing is line by coming around the wicket so we just wait for the sightscreen to be moved","Australia 253 and 334 (Katich 83, Hilfenhaus 56*, Gul 4-61) beat Pakistan 148 and 289 (Butt 92, North 6-55, Smith 3-51) by 150 runs Scorecard Salman Butt moved to a fluent 92 before a lapse in concentration to Marcus North's first ball of the match cost him his wicket Getty Images Marcus North claimed the remarkable figures of 6 for 55 to join Shane Watson on the brand-new neutral honours board at Lord's, while Steven Smith chipped in with three key scalps in his first innings as a Test bowler, as Pakistan hurtled to defeat by 150 runs on the fourth afternoon of the first Test against Australia. Set an improbable 440 for victory, Pakistan began their chase boldly through the efforts of Salman Butt, who made a fluent 92 in a 102-run stand for the second wicket with the debutant Azhar Ali, and at 152 for 1 with more than five sessions of the match remaining, there was an outside chance of a miracle taking place. But North's introduction transformed the contest shortly before lunch. With his eyes lighting up as North floated his first delivery gently towards his pads, Butt toppled out of his crease to be stumped down the leg-side by Tim Paine, before Umar Akmal jabbed a lifter to slip on the stroke of lunch. With wickets continuing to slip away thereafter, the last vestige of Pakistani hope vanished when the captain Shahid Afridi slapped his fourth delivery down the throat of deep midwicket for 2 - a shot which doubtless contributed to his post-match declaration that next week's Headingley Test would be his last."
"Toss news: Pakistan have won the toss and will bat first. Massive cheer at the news of a winning toss! Hussey to Shahzaib, OUT done it! David Hussey strikes! Not the most memorable shot you'll ever see, a massive heave-ho across the line and it crashes into the pads bang in front Tait to Salman Butt, 1 wide starts by bolting down a wide outside off stump, Butt plays but can't reach it O'Keefe to Salman Butt, OUT gone this time! Silence in Birmingham! Butt tried to sweep firmly, but it got a top edge and looped towards White at short fine leg, who slid forward and held a good catch Johnson to Kamran, SIX runs attempted slower ball, Kamran read it and murdered it down the ground where Hussey, leapt, took the ball and tried to parry it back in play before he landed outside the rope, almost pulled it off, but his foot was just in contact with the ground while he tried to parry it away - shades of his IPL catch there Johnson to Kamran, OUT gone this time! Banged in short, Akmal tried to wheel an enormous pull shot away but got it very high on the bat, and it looped over midwicket where Clarke ran back to pull off an excellent catch Hopes to Umar Akmal, 1 bye another huge swipe to leg, this time he misses completely but a fumble behind the stumps allows a bye Nannes to Malik, OUT he gets a wicket straight away! Nannes sent one down just short of a length at decent pace, Malik hops back to pull but the ball just rushes on to him and he ends up lapping it ever so tamely to mid-on. Really soft dismissal there, he won't be pleased... but the crowd are, because it brings Boom Boom to the crease! Nannes to Afridi, 1 leg bye Nannes goes full this time, and they pick up one as the ball squirts off the boot/pad to square leg Nannes to Umar Akmal, OUT Umar falls! He hadn't been quite so fluent today, gone for 25 from 21. He had 50 by the time he had faced 21 balls yesterday! Nannes flings one down short and from a wide angle, Umar goes to pull but top-edges straight up in the air. The fielders converge but Nannes calls for it and takes it. The scorecard will read caught-and-bowled but it was quite a catch, went miles in the air. Hussey to Amir, (no ball) OUT drama! What's happened here? Hussey comes round the wicket and bowls one full on off stump. Aamer cracks the ball back to him, and the umpire calls no-ball as he's over-stepped ... but Hussey collects the ball in his follow-through and breaks the stumps at the non-strikers end, where Razzaq had backed up too far! So, it'll be a Free hit, but Australia have a very important wicket! O'Keefe to Umar Gul, OUT But that will! Well, it's just a replay of the last ball, except this time Gul swung across the line of a legitimate delivery and is bowled! A second wicket for O'Keefe on debut O'Keefe to Shoaib Akhtar, OUT third wicket for O'Keefe! Well, Aamer was nailing them and Shoaib wanted to join in, charging down the track and swinging massively to leg ... except he misses the ball completely and it clatters into the leg stump. Well-bowled by O'Keefe, he has turned the ball an inch today but has been nice and accurate These two sides, of course, played an epic semi final in the World Twenty20.

Shoaib Akhtar to Hussey, 1 wide Shoaib just gets this one wrong, sliding it down the leg side Afridi to Hussey, 1 leg bye this time it's fired in towards the legs and thuds off bat and pad towards short fine leg for one Shoaib Akhtar to White, 1 leg bye Shoaib charges in and raps the batsman's pads with an inswinging length delivery! Wow, he really looks pooped, barely has the energy to appeal for the lbw. It was slipping down leg though, so not even considered. Ajmal to O'Keefe, OUT this is an interesting one... the ball squirts behind square on the leg side off an inside edge and Hussey charges through for the single, O'Keefe is late to respond to the call as the throw is fired to the non-striker's end. Ajmal collects and breaks the stumps, but lets go of the ball as he does ... tough one for the third umpire... That's out! He only let go of the ball after the stumps were d So, Pakistan restrict Australia to 151 to take the Twenty20 series 2-0. Their batting was a little more patchy today, but a team effort took them to 162. The bowlers looked like a good unit, though, and Shoaib looked much more fluent today. Mohammad Aamer bowled with pace and intelligence to finish with 3 for 27, and there was no weak link in the attack. For Australia, Steve O'Keefe bowled very well to pick up three wickets Player of the match is Mohammad Amir, PAK","Pakistan 162 for 9 (Kamran Akmal 33, O'Keefe 3-29, Nannes 3-30) beat Australia 151 (D Hussey 33, Mohammad Aamer 3-27) by 11 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kamran Akmal gave Pakistan a good start, and they kicked on from there PA Photos If Pakistan are a confidence team, their Twenty20 efforts over the past two days augur well for next week's first Test. A day after they ended their 12-match losing stretch against Australia across all formats, Mohammad Aamer helped them begin their own winning streak with an 11-run victory that brought 2-0 series triumph. Tests are a very different story, but their Twenty20 form has given the group a spark. There was a distinct sense of d?j? vu after Monday's game; again there was a big crowd of Pakistan fans, again Pakistan scored around the 160 mark and again Australia's batsmen were tied down and couldn't lift their tempo for a successful chase. The last pair was left needing 19 from the final over and despite a six from Dirk Nannes, they came up short."
"The latest news from the ground is that Pakistan have won the toss and will bat first. Nannes to Shahzaib, OUT gone! Shahzaib goes first ball, Nannes strikes with his fifth ball of the innings! That was full and angling across the right-handed Shahzaib. He aimed an ambitious mow over mid-on but toe-ended it to give the fielder an easy catch. He didn't even have to move... First blood to Australia. Tait to Kamran, 1 wide not the greatest start, very quick indeed but hurled short and wide down the leg side Tait to Kamran, 1 wide is Tait trying just a bit too hrd as he steams in? This one strays well down the leg side and that's another wide Hussey to Salman Butt, OUT tragedy for Kamran! Butt pushed the ball softly to point and Kamran set off for what would've been a tight single. Butt watches the ball and goes nowhere, though, and by the time Kamran turns and tries to scamper back the ball is thrown in and he's well short. Whose fault was that? I'm not sure, but that's a shame for Pakistan as Kamran was going really well Smith to Afridi, OUT gone first ball! Smith sent down a full toss, dead straight, and Afridi was struck on the front pad as he went down to sweep. That was right in front, and quickly given. An audible groan from the crowd as the finger went up. Nannes to Malik, OUT now, what's happened here? Nannes sent down a slower cutter, Malik tried to guide it down to third man and appeared to get an edge on it. As Paine dives forward to take the catch they sprint through for a single ... The Umpire has not given that as byes, so has he hit it? Did Paine take the catch cleanly as he tumbled forward? ... Yes! He has! After several replays, they decide that Paine managed to get the glove underneath that one, Tait to Abdul Razzaq, OUT clatter! Tait has made a mess of Razzaq's stumps with the perfect reverse-swinging yorker at high pace! Razzaq as looking for the full ball to thump through cover, but he was beaten for pace and couldn't get the bat down in time. Tait strikes! Tait to Umar Akmal, 5 wide Umar went across to off as Tait sent down the yorker ... but he's lost his line and sends the ball down the leg side. Paine can't get across in time, though he gets a touch to it, and that's gone to the boundary! Tait to Umar Akmal, OUT castled him! Great thinking from Tait, Umar must have been expecting a thunderbolt the way he charged in, but instead he sends down a slow cutter. Umar was through the shot before the ball reached him, and looked back to see his stumps disturbed. Tait to Umar Gul, 1 wide dug in halfway down, Gul takes his eye off it, ducking and turning away. Well, that's given as a wide but that's a bit harsh! That barely missed the helmet Nannes to Umar Gul, SIX runs this time he's nailed the pull! Muscly shot from Gul, little more than a short-arm jab but the ball sails into the crowd at deep midwicket Out come Australia's openers to join the Pakistan team already on the field. Mohammad Aamer to open the bowling, David Warner on strike. Solitary wide slip in place Amir to Watson, 1 wide more swing for Aamer, but this started too straight and swung down the leg side to be called wide Abdul Razzaq to Hussey, SIX runs six runs! Hussey comes down the track, not getting to the pitch but just swinging the bat nicely through the line to lift the ball up and way over long-off. Afridi to Warner, 1 wide quicker ball, misdirected down the leg side Umar Gul to Paine, 1 leg bye Paine shuffles across to off, is struck on the pad as Gul sends one snaking in full. That was slipping down leg though, and they take a leg-bye to get Hussey on strike The Pakistan team form a huddle near the boundary's edge, great spirit shown by them today. Umar Akmal's inspirational innings gave them a total to defend and the bowlers - Shoaib aside - responded in superb fashion. This is the first time Australia have lost to Pakistan in 13 games, across all formats, and Pakistan have finally broken their Aussie duck, which stretches back to their defeat in the Champions Trophy last September, through the disastrous Australi Player of the match is Umar Akmal, PAK","Pakistan 167 for 8 (Umar Akmal 64) beat Australia 144 (Warner 41, Ajmal 3-26, Aamer 3-27) by 23 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Umar Akmal's 64 set up Pakistan's win Getty Images It can't bring back the World Twenty20 trophy, but Pakistan extracted some sort of revenge on Australia in their first meeting since the semi-final in St Lucia. Again, a vigorous Umar Akmal half-century set up Pakistan's innings but this time their bowlers, led by Mohammad Aamer, did enough to strangle Australia's run-rate and deny Michael Clarke's men, who couldn't chase down 168. In May, it took something special from Michael Hussey to drive Australia into the decider against England, as he monstered the 18 needed off the last over, bowled by Saeed Ajmal. This time, Ajmal fittingly collected the final wicket and was mobbed by his team-mates as Australia fell to a 23-run defeat, their first loss to Pakistan in any format in their past 13 meetings. Umar set up the victory with the fastest Twenty20 international half-century by a Pakistan player, a 21-ball effort that brought the thousands of Pakistan fans at Edgbaston to their feet."
"Broad to Ponting, OUT short again, and that's the big breakthrough that England needed! An attempted pull, but Ponting muffs his signature stroke, and lobs a simple chance almost off the back of his bat, straight through to Kieswetter! Swann to White, OUT Swann does it again! The first-over demon strikes! White was looking to give himself room, Swann threw it wider and slower and White ended up dragging it without any timing down to Yardy, in from the long off boundary Swann to Paine, OUT oh dear, this is ugly. Pain gets in a horrible tangle, aiming an expansive reverse-sweep to a flighted ball outside off, it pitched and turned back, spinning into a flurry of gloves and bat and cannoning on to the stumps Bresnan to Marsh, 1 wide bit short from Bresnan, in fact, very shot, and wide enough for the umpire to give it a wide Swann to Marsh, OUT gone this time, Swann does the trick. Marsh tried to smash this inside-out over deep cover, Swann threw it wider and Marsh couldn't get the distance, Morgan ran around from long off to take the catch. Brings the end to an Anderson to Hussey, SIX runs Hussey is a dangerous man to finish the innings, really, and here he's picked up a full ball and deposited it miles over midwicket for six! Broad to Smith, OUT some joy here for England, Smith forehand-slaps a short ball but straight down to Anderson at long off Broad to Hussey, OUT gone this time! Broad gets another, Hussey slicing a drive down to long off, but it has been a superb innings, completely flipped this game on its head Brydon Coverdale has furiously typed out his bulletin to tell you more, so check that out. Hello folks, the players are back out in the middle and we're all set for what should be a cracking chase. I'm Liam Brickhill, and Sahil Dutta and I will be your commentators for the second innings. Tait to Strauss, 1 wide very quick again, but misdirected down the leg side this time and called wide Tait to Strauss, OUT clatter! That's the dismissal every fast bowler wants to see! Tait fires one in on a length, gets some nice shape in to the left-hander to beat his defensive poke and smash into the top of the off stump. That's a real sta Tait to Yardy, 1 wide speared down the leg side, that's a wide. So Yardy will have to face up to that delivery again... Tait to Yardy, OUT nope. I don't know what the thinking was sending Yardy in to face Tait, but it really hasn't worked. Tait fires one in fuller and Yardy simply leaves it - I don't think he quite picked the ball up - and the ball smashes int Bollinger to Morgan, 1 wide left-hander messes up the radar as he spears one down the leg side Bollinger to Morgan, 1 leg bye sharp yorker! Morgan is struck on the foot to cries of anguish from the Australian fielders, but that was slipping way down leg Hopes to Morgan, 1 wide pushed too far down leg, that's a wide Hopes to Morgan, OUT gone! What a catch! Morgan nailed a pull shot, smashing it flat towards a straightish midwicket, the Marsh in the deep ran round and dived, juggling the ball as he landed to clasp on to the catch Smith to Pietersen, OUT gone! Maybe that thigh won't get much of a testing then. It was short and slightly wide, Pietersen went back to cut but ends up with a bottom edge on to his foot which goes on to the stumps leaving England in a bit of Hussey to PD Collingwood, 1 wide flung well wide of the stumps, that's a huge wide Tait to Bresnan, OUT Ponting strikes! Brilliant from the Australian captain! Bresnan pushed towards him and set off for one, Ponting collected, spun and threw at the non-striker's end, direct hit has Bresnan miles short. Big strike that, sho Tait to PD Collingwood, OUT over and out! Tait strikes! Stumps clattered! Collingwood advanced down the track, bit of inswing beats the batsman and uproots the leg stump. Defiant knock from Collingwood, but all over now. Bollinger to Broad, OUT Duggie has done it! Terrific caught and bowled! Broad mistimed a check-drive back down the wicket, Bollinger stuck out a hand and found the ball in it! That should finally settle this game Tait to Swann, OUT that'll be all! Tait finishes it off, which is apt, with a slower ball, which isn't! Swann backed away and tried to carve it over mid off but he couldn't time it and ended up gifting a catch to mid off. Australia have come back very strongly from 3-0 down - they've beaten England comfortably in the last two games. It was Mike Hussey and Shaun Marsh's partnership that first turned the game towards Australia, but Shaun Tait nailed home the advantage Player of the match is Shaun Tait, AUS","Marker of the day Everything about this series has been viewed through an Ashes-shaped prism. At Cardiff England were delighted when their short-ball plan worked against Michael Clarke, and here a similar method proved successful against Ricky Ponting. Australia's captain has had problems against the short ball in recent times - stemming from a tasty head-to-head with Kemar Roach - and on this occasion he got into an awful tangle against Broad's bouncer and gloved a catch to Craig Kieswetter. Both sides will store that memory away for Brisbane. Timely wicket of the day Tim Paine has struggled for fluency throughout the series and it came to a head at Lord's with a laborious 90-ball 54."
"5.05pm Australia have won the toss and will bat. Malinga to Clarke, (no ball) oops! That's a chest-high full toss from Malinga, which is a scary prospect, but it was well down leg and the slower ball, which came out of the hand all wrong Malinga to Warner, 1 wide well wide of off stump, David Warner couldn't reach that and it's called a wide Fernando to Warner, OUT gone! Fernando breaks through Perera to Watson, OUT skied and taken by Murali at long-off! Watson tries to go over the top but it's another one off the toe of the bat, and Murali makes no mistake - what a start by Sri Lanka! Randiv to Hussey, OUT Randiv strikes first ball! Hussey looks to cut but is surprised by the bounce from Randiv's topspinner, an edge is well taken by Sangakkara. This is really unravelling for Australia. Randiv to Smith, OUT oh, good bowling from Randiv! Smith dances down the pitch and Randiv holds that ball back a little, doesn't impart much spin and it beats the bat, Smith is comprehensively stumped Randiv to Haddin, OUT two wickets in the over! Haddin's gone for the slog sweep and hasn't quite got enough on that, Mathews at deep midwicket takes a comfortable catch, Randiv gets another one Murali to Haddin, 1 wide wrong line, down leg side and called a wide Malinga to Hastings, 1 wide short and fast, Hastings hasn't much idea about that and lets it go through to Sangakkara. Oh, that's been called a wide, that's simply not the right decision, it was only head height Malinga to McKay, 1 wide oops, down leg side and that's justifiably called a wide The Australians are out on the field, Peter Siddle is warming up for his first ball in an international match since January. But it's Clint McKay to bowl the first over from the Prindiville Stand End. Nannes to Sangakkara, 1 wide short again, but this one is called wide, and rightly so as it's quite a way over head height Smith to Dilshan, OUT Smith gets a wicket, Dilshan has rather thrown it away there. He's danced down the pitch and tried to slog it over midwicket, his eyes already heading in the direction of his intended shot, but it's turned past him and Haddin whips off the bails Smith to Perera, SIX runs massive! That's easily the biggest six of the match, Perera has launched that one over long-on, just got to the pitch of the ball and then used all his muscle That's a comprehensive victory for Sri Lanka, they really did outplay Australia for the whole match. Early wickets had the Australians on the ropes and Randiv and Perera in particular ensured the target wasn't too high; then Sangakkara and Dilshan guided the chase. Sri Lanka won by 7 wickets (with 21 balls remaining) Player of the match is Suraj Randiv, SL","Sri Lanka 3 for 135 (Sangakkara 44*, Dilshan 41) beat Australia 8 for 133 (Haddin 35, Randiv 3-25) by 7 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Tillakaratne Dilshan's 41 off 34 balls helped swing Sri Lanka to victory AFP A brutal Sri Lankan performance delivered Australia their first Twenty20 defeat at home as Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara thrust the tourists to a commanding seven-wicket victory. The hosts were first overwhelmed by a stunning bowling display, dropping to 5 for 43 in the 11th over and finishing at 8 for 133, before becoming the victims of an explosive batting effort. The opener Dilshan guided the small chase with 41 off 34 balls while the captain Kumar Sangakkara registered a delightful 44 off 43 and the game was over 21 balls early. With the English squad staying a short walk away as they prepare for the Ashes - Kevin Pietersen was in the stands - Australia suffered their fourth Twenty20 loss in a row and their first in 11 games at home. The defeat felt as severe as the result inflicted by England in Southampton at the start of Australia's failed 2005 Ashes tour."
"Yuvraj to Clarke, 1 leg bye huge appeal for lbw turned down. Full from Yuvraj, on middle and off as Clarke bounds out of the crease. Hits him on and around off stump as he misses the flick. Was he too far down? Was he outside the line? Leg bye taken towards third man. It landed on leg and was straightening. Might have hit middle and off, or might not have. Clarke was well for Ashwin to Hussey, OUT this time the lbw appeal is upheld, Hussey looked to be tiring over the past few overs, a short of length ball, Hussey looks to pull that one, he misses and is struck on the thigh pad on the back leg in front of middle and leg, that was going on to hit, no doubt, the umpire didn't have any either Vinay to White, SIX runs Wow, White gets a gift from his Royal Challengers Bangalore team-mate, a juicy full toss and White has the spectators scurrying by depositing that in the second tier beyond long-on 6.25pm: Still 20 minutes to go for the chase to start. Time enough for you to check out our free Chrome extension. Starc to Yuvraj, 1 wide slower one bowled short but down the leg side, called a wide Hauritz to Kohli, 1 leg bye got across and tried to work it into the leg side, goes off the pad, they steal a leg-bye Hastings to Kohli, 1 wide slow bouncer down the leg side, Kohli goes for a flamboyant pull, he misses and it is called a wide McKay to Kohli, SIX runs he wants to finish things off quickly now, slower one bowled on a length and he smashes it high and handsome into the stands over long-on India won by 5 wickets (with 7 balls remaining) Player of the match is Virat Kohli, INDIA","India 292 for 5 (Kohli 118, Raina 71*, Yuvraj 58) beat Australia 289 for 3 (Clarke 111*, White 89*, Hussey 69) by five wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Virat Kohli's calm century shepherded the chase AFP The target of 290 appeared to be stiff, especially when India were wobbling at 35 for 2 in the ninth over, but Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh maintained their sangfroid to get India close before the adventurous Suresh Raina sealed the win in style. Kohli, in particular, impressed. He not only lost Yuvraj in the 34th over with India still 118 runs adrift of the target but also, by then, was suffering from severe cramps and was forced to bat with a runner. If those hurdles fazed him, he didn't show it and went on to clinch the game in the company of Raina. The chase mirrored Australia's innings to an extent."
"10.00am Strauss calls heads, England have won the toss and will bowl first. What's more, it's confirmed that Tim Bresnan comes in for Steven Finn. Australia field an unchanged team, Punter says he wasn't sure what he was going to do first thing this morning - his instinct told him bat, but with the grass and moisture in the wicket the bowlers are likely to control proceed Tremlett to Watson, OUT third time lucky for England, Tremlett strikes with a cracker of a delivery, climbed from a length and rapped the glove, it looped gently to gully, simple enough chance for England to finally hold one Anderson to Ponting, 1 leg bye this time Anderson jumps wider of the crease and angles it in before swinging it away, the bowler was probably looking for too much though and it thuds off the pads for a single Bresnan to Hughes, OUT Bresnan has his first Ashes wicket and Hughes has gone. Full and wide, inviting a slash but Hughes didn't get enough of it, instead the edge flew straight to Pietersen who made no mistake in the gully Tremlett to Ponting, OUT gone! Tremlett strikes again, what a delivery. Spitting off a length and going away off the seam, Ponting is rooted to the crease and pushes at the delivery. A thick edge flies straight to Graeme Swann Tremlett to Clarke, 1 leg bye off the pad and trickling down to short fine leg, and they're through for a leg bye Anderson to Hussey, OUT edged! Anderson strikes straight away, and what a delivery to do it with. Landing on middle and off and shooting towards the slips, the length was full and Hussey was drawn into the drive, getting a good, healthy edge that flies through to Prior Anderson to Smith, OUT Smith gone now, always looked a matter of time, pushed very hard at this outside off, touch of nibble away off the pitch found the edge and Prior did the rest Anderson to Clarke, OUT brilliant bowling from Anderson, he's just worked Clarke over with consistent, probing away swing and this time it finds the edge, Clarke pushing at the ball, feathered edge and Prior collects the simple chance. Australia in total disarray Bresnan to Haddin, OUT Bresnan has another and Haddin has gifted him this, flat-footed waft of a drive, flicked the edge and went through to Strauss. Pretty miserable stuff this from the home side Anderson to Johnson, OUT Anderson has his man! Johnson's gone for a duck, this is a cracking delivery, seams away off a full length, finds the edge and Prior has his fourth catch Tremlett to Siddle, OUT there we go, another one is on his way and Australia are nine down. Tremlett pitches one up invitingly outside off, a touch of movement through the air and off the pitch takes the ball away from the bat and a regulation edge lands safely in Prior's gloves. His fifth catch today Tremlett to Hilfenhaus, OUT all over, Australia are out for 98 as Hilfenhaus feathers a sixth catch through to Prior That's tea in Melbourne. The hosts are all out for their lowest score against England at the MCG since Test cricket's very first game, way back in 1877. They've simply been blown away by seam and swing bowling of the highest standard. There are no real demons in this pitch - it's not hooping around corners. England were just the more disciplined team out there today. They Johnson to Prior, 1 leg bye nudged close on the leg side, there is some hesitation before the single is taken ... Johnson charges through and aims the ball towards the stumps with his right boot, but it goes wide. Would've been in all the same Hilfenhaus to Swann, OUT what a catch! The crowd were quiet for a good few seconds before they realised a wicket had actually just fallen. Banged in short again by Hilfenhaus, Swann hooks and a thick edge flew fast and straight and looked to be going over Haddin's head ... but he timed his salmon-leap to perfection and got both hands to it ""Praveen Singh is forgetting about Hauritz who has made 2 centuries in his last 2 state test matches and a 50 in his last state ODI as well as taken quite a few wickets. Why is he off the cards?"" Who knows, Bryce. For some reason they've felt they can't pick him. Lunch So, finally Australia work their way through England's line-up. One man they didn't get past is Jonathan Trott, who finishes with a majestic, unbeaten 168. Siddle bowled with real heart and finishes with a deserved 6 for 75, but England have a lead of 415 - which is, as Miller points out, an Ashes record margin for a team batting second - and Australia will have to Player of the match is Jonathan Trott, ENG","Match abandoned Australia v India Scorecard The ground staff couldn't beat the weather in Kochi AFP The opening match of the three-game India-Australia series was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Kochi. Heavy rain before the one-dayer saturated the ground and while the weather was clear at the scheduled start time, the clouds returned to send everyone home. It was an unfortunate result for the thousands of locals who were filling the stadium in their blue shirts. Both teams are fielding inexperienced squads so the expectation was high, but everyone will have to wait for the second match in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday. The Kerala Cricket Association has been criticised by former BCCI secretary SK Nair, who said better arrangements with respect to drainage and scheduling could have been made to prevent an abandonment."
"Bhuvneshwar to Carey, OUT gone, Carey's nicked off to second slip Some inconsistent bounce playing on the minds of the batsmen here. Beautiful bowling by Bhuvi as well. Short of good length, kicks up a little more than he may have anticipated, and it straightens just enough to shave the outside edge. This time, because of the bounce, it carries to Kohli. Even so, he had to get down full tilt to hold onto it Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 leg bye this one moves back in and lobs away towards third man off the pad as Finch misses the flick Bhuvneshwar to Finch, OUT and after all that, Bhuvneshwar has his man. Finch's hardwork comes to an end. It's the inswinger again. It's given him a miserable tome and continues to do so. He's way forward and crouching to defend but the ball finds a way to nip in and hit him on the kneeroll Shankar to Marsh, 1 wide short of a length, skips down leg as he looks to glance it away Shankar to Marsh, 1 leg bye 124kph, half-volley outside leg, he tries to whip and misses, it comes off pad and rolls away for a leg bye Jadeja to Marsh, 1 wide fired down the leg side, called wide Jadeja to Marsh, 1 wide pitching on leg, spinning down, he misses a pull, called wide Jadeja to Khawaja, 1 wide another one fired down leg Chahal to Marsh, 1 wide, OUT Stumped off a wide down leg! Leg break wide down leg, he skipped early, missed it by a long way trying to whip it behind square, Dhoni gets down the leg side, takes it, doesn't get the bails off as quick as normal but he gets them off in time! Marsh was just short of getting back! Chahal to Khawaja, OUT caught and bowled! Soft leading edge! Shorter length leg break down leg, he is back and trying to work it behind square, closed the face too early, gets a thick leading edge that just lobs back to the bowler. Khawaja just watches it painfully as it slowly lands in Chahal's waiting hands! Chahal to Stoinis, OUT caught at slip! Brilliant leg spin bowling! This was a fizzing leg break, drifting into middle and leg, it spun, Stoinis was back, closing the face trying to push into the leg side, it catches the edge and Rohit dives low to his right at slip to pouch the catch! Superb bowling Shami to Maxwell, OUT Maxwell's holed out here. India went in with a clear plan to him. Shami played on his natural instincts to pull and bangs this in short again. Maxwell can't control the hook, gets another thick top-edge, this one sails fine and Bhuvneshwar Kumar latches on brilliantly, sprinting forward from the deep and diving in front for a well-judged catch Chahal to Jhye Richardson, OUT pays the price for playing against the turn. Nicely looped in towards leg stump, temping him to close the face against the turn. Lands just short enough to muster up some turn and results in the batsman chipping it tamely to short midwicket as he closes the face Chahal to Handscomb, OUT shifts back to a length ball and tries to turn it away into the on side with the angle. But the ball skids on and straightens late to beat the closing face of the bat before pinning him in front of middle. That's plumb as a duck. Handscomb reviews. He's the last recognised batsman and so goes for it. Smashing middle of middle. Five wickets for Chahal. Chahal to Zampa, OUT and another one goes. Sixth wicket for Chahal, equals Agarkar's record for most wickets at the MCG by a visiting bowler. This one's nicely looped up and inviting him to come forward. Zampa charges down and swipes big without getting entirely underneath it and holes out to long-on Shami to Stanlake, OUT and that will be a wrap. Shami pitches it full and straight on a leg stump line, Stanlake closes the face against the line and the ball goes straight through the bat, pings the pad and deflects onto the stumps Stanlake to Jadhav, 1 wide 133kph, bouncer wide of off, inside the guideline but it's called wide because it's too high Siddle to Jadhav, 1 wide full toss fired wide down leg Stoinis to Jadhav, 1 leg bye slower ball, hits him on the thigh, bounced into the off side Alright then. That finally brings us to the end of this long, and engrossing tour of Australia. Easily India's best, and most successful tour ever, across formats. India have sent out some great teams in Australia in the past, produced great performances from great players, and pushed Australia. But never before have they dominated them in the manner they have on this tour. They had their stars in each of the three legs, but the team has p India won by 7 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is Yuzvendra Chahal, INDIA","India 3 for 234 (Dhoni 87*, Jadhav 61*) beat Australia 230 (Handscomb 58, Chahal 6-42) by seven wickets Regardless of the result in Melbourne, India's tour of Australia would have been triumph. But it was given the perfect ending as Yuzvendra Chahal's career-best 6 for 42, the joint best ODI figures in Australia, set up a seven-wicket victory to take the series. Chahal's haul left a modest target but a slow pitch made scoring tricky as MS Dhoni, whose role has dominated the narrative of the series, scored his third half-century in three innings - while being given three lives - and the recalled Kedar Jadhav produced an excellent hand. It's the depth of players available that marks out the best teams and the success of Chahal and Jadhav, playing their first matches of the series in place of the rested Kuldeep Yadav and Ambati Rayudu, slotted in seamlessly. Chahal's second ball of the match began Australia's downfall when he had the in-form Shaun Marsh stumped, and he claimed three wickets in each of his two spells, surpassing his previous best of 5 for 22 against South Africa at Centurion."
"Swann to Hussey, OUT Swann strikes! What a breakthrough as Hussey gets a thin edge behind and Prior takes the catch. Initially the umpire gives it not out, but Prior races down the pitch to Swann and signals for the revie Anderson to Haddin, OUT Anderson strikes but it looks a horrid shot. If it came off we'd be cheering but as it is, this is a gift. Well outside off stump at a drive-me length, Haddin threw his arms at it, leaning back, he Finn to Johnson, OUT gone! Finn gets the breakthrough with another shortish one tempting Johnson to pull, but his shot flies straight to Anderson at square leg, where he takes a simple catch. Swann to Hilfenhaus, OUT ah, there's the last wicket as Hilfenhaus gets an inside edge onto the thigh and it's taken by Cook at short leg Australia have managed to get their total up to 268, which is well below par but given their horrid start, isn't too bad a finish. And if their fast bowlers can get a few early wickets, who knows what could happen. But good luck Johnson to Cook, OUT gone! There's the breakthrough for Australia and it goes to Johnson. Full outside off, brings Cook into the drive and it flies low to gully where Hussey picks up a good low catch. Johnson to Trott, OUT gone! Johnson strikes again. Full on off stump, hint of swing back into the right hander and that's plumb. Trott driving and is beaten by the movement, superb stuff from Mitchell. Johnson to Pietersen, OUT another one! Pietersen is gone for a duck! Beautiful bowling from Johnson as this one swings back down the line, Marais Erasmus gives it lbw and Pietersen wants a review. The bat was nowhere near Harris to Strauss, OUT Harris joins the party! Strauss is gone! An edge behind and Haddin takes the straightforward catch! That was just a good line and length - across Strauss and with the swing that has been around he f Johnson to PD Collingwood, OUT another lbw shout as this one swings in, but it's given not out. Ponting asks for a review, but that looked high and off-side. But wait, the replays show that shape was enough to straighten Harris to Bell, 1 wide huge swing, and terribly wide of off, Haddin does well to dive in front of Watson at first slip and take it, but that's clearly a wide Siddle to Prior, OUT gone! Well, the short ball has worked in the end but probably not quite as they expected. The ball after getting hit, Prior moves across his stumps to work it away, but it deflects off his body, back Siddle to Bell, (no ball) stays round the wicket, short of a length and pushed outside off which is left alone...and he overstepped Harris to Swann, OUT Harris strikes! Swann is gone, prodding forward and getting an edge through to Haddin, it was another good ball that just straightened enough, well deserved by Harris Johnson to Tremlett, OUT gone! Johnson gets five, with a cracking inswinger that takes the off stump out of the ground. Really well bowled and Johnson has deserved that haul - now, can Australia finish England off before Johnson to Anderson, OUT it's all over. Johnson has six. Anderson hangs his bat out at a short ball outside off and the edge flies comfortably to Watson at first slip The Australians have a lead of 81 and they get into a huddle, savouring the moment.

He finished off the visitors in a hurry as they were blown away in 10 overs on the fourth morning to set up a potentially thrilling conclusion to this series over the Christmas and New Year period. Harris collected the rewards that eluded him in Adelaide as he finished with nine in the match, while Mitchell Johnson claimed the other wicket to fall as he, too, picked up nine. Johnson's revival in this match reflects Australia's upward curve, leaving England with much to ponder before the MCG Test starts on Boxing Day. This was Australia's first Test victory in six matches since beating Pakistan at Lord's."
"Finn to North, OUT Finn strikes! North is caught behind! What was he trying to do here? A shot of some sort was on, there was width on offer, but he pushed limply at it - barely moving his feet - to send a thin edge through to Prior Swann to Hussey, OUT he's gone! Hussey is gone in the 90s, and Swann has finally spun one appreciably!

The significance of the win cannot be underestimated, as it gives England a 1-0 advantage heading in to the third Test in Perth, which starts in a week and a half. The triumph came when Swann turned a ball through the gate to bowl Peter Siddle, completing his five-for and confirming the margin of an innings and 71 runs. It was a devastating morning for Australia, who began the day hopeful that they could survive for a draw with six wickets in hand, but it took England less than 90 minutes to skittle the remaining Australians. Last time England took a series lead in Australia, it was 1986-87, and they did not give it away."

Getty Images A rebuilding South Africa sealed a series victory over an Australian outfit struggling with the same phase during a dominating performance in Adelaide that earned a 3-1 lead. The tourists arrived last month hoping for some success against the world champions in the Test and one-day formats, but they will leave with commanding victories in each arena after wrapping up this five-match contest before Friday's final fixture in Perth. While South Africa's order has gained confidence, from Herschelle Gibbs at the top to Albie Morkel and Johan Botha towards the bottom, the Australians are in worse shape than when they began. Throughout the series their batting has struggled to build on strong platforms and they wasted another chance on Monday as they dropped from the comfort of 2 for 110 in the 20th over to 222 in the 48th. The visitors have conquered much bigger totals than that this month and there was little to worry about once Gibbs determined to hit as many boundaries as possible."

PA Photos Albie Morkel destroyed Australia in the dying stages for the second time in the series as he powered South Africa to a three-wicket win and a 2-1 lead. Morkel built on the solid work of Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis to guide the highest successful ODI chase at the SCG and put a slight dampener on the Sydney crowd's day after the fans had been thrilled by their local hero David Warner during the Australian innings. Morkel fell five short of the target of 270 when he skied Nathan Hauritz to long-on but his 40 from 22 balls had done the job and he had already slammed Hauritz for a six and a pair of fours over midwicket in the same over.

They picked up 51 from the powerplay and it was a frenetic end to a chase that had meandered through the middle overs, when Duminy showed more self-control than some Trappist monks, as he compiled 71 without a boundary.

PA Photos David Warner made one of the most memorable international debuts imaginable as he lit up the MCG with 89 from 43 balls to set up Australia's 52-run win over South Africa. Not even a superb 78 from JP Duminy could rescue South Africa's chase and he watched his partners fall around him as they fizzled out for 130 in the 18th over. The crowd appreciated Duminy's brilliance, particularly when he scooped a Shaun Tait half-volley over the wicketkeeper's head for six, but it was Warner who was undeniably the star of the show. It was an incredible situation for a man previously so unknown that the scoreboard operators didn't have a photo of him when the teams were displayed. Warner, 22, had already created history by simply playing the match; he was the first man to debut for Australia in any format without first-class experience since 1877."

PA Photos For the second consecutive year Australia have pulled off a last-minute victory in the Sydney Test, this time despite a courageous and painful batting effort from the injured Graeme Smith. Last season it was Michael Clarke who bowled Australia home nine minutes from stumps and on this occasion Mitchell Johnson picked up the final wicket with five minutes remaining to give Australia a consolation win that left the series ledger a little less lopsided at 2-1. The last breakthrough came when Johnson nipped a ball back off a crack in the wearing pitch to bowl Smith, who had been incredibly gutsy in coming to the crease at No. 11 with a broken left hand and a right elbow so sore he said he could barely brush his teeth in the morning. Smith survived for 29 minutes with Makhaya Ntini as he aimed to salvage a draw but every fast ball he faced drew winces around the ground as he quickly released his left hand and gritted his teeth."
"Jadeja to Handscomb, OUT Stumped! Slick from Dhoni! Handscomb tried to sweep a very full ball, was beaten by length, it spun past off, Dhoni takes it well, Handscomb's back foot is out of the crease, he didn't realise. Dhoni did. He whipped the bails off and Handscomb looked down and saw his foot was out! Shami to Stoinis, OUT and he gets him next ball. Shortish outside off, doesn't climb as high as Stoinis expects as he goes for the pull.

Undone by a 119kph slower ball. It was a good length and wide, Maxwell tried to loft this over cover, but he dragged it to long off, DK stands 15 metres in off the rope and takes the catch easily Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, OUT caught at long off! Bhuvi does it again with a slower ball! Good length slower ball outside off, Marsh lofts this towards long off but doesn't nail it, Jadeja, like DK, camps 15 metres in off the rope and takes the easy catch! Superb innings from Marsh ends with 13 balls remaining Shami to Jhye Richardson, OUT caught at deep point! Another length off cutter slower ball wide off, he reaches out and slices this high to deep backward point, Shikhar Dhawan waits under it and takes the catch comfortably. Jhye Richardson to S Dhawan, 1 wide looks to angle it into the stumps again, ends up overdoing it and whanging it down the leg side Behrendorff to S Dhawan, OUT and that is that. He's played with a lot of freedom today, but now he's played one shot too many. Length ball, angling into off stump, not quite full enough for the pick-up shot over midwicket. Plays too early, and ends up spooning it high in the air, off the outside half of the bat. Khawaja Lyon to Rayudu, 1 leg bye good length down leg, it comes off pad as he tries to pull, ricochets off Carey's pad and rolls away Maxwell to Rayudu, OUT caught at deep midwicket! The pressure got to him! He skips down and tries to launch this with the spin high over midwicket, it was a touch slower, he got underneath it and skied it high to deep midwicket, Stoinis camped under it and took the catch! Siddle to Kohli, 1 wide bouncer, climbs loopily, well over Kohli's head, before dropping down tennis-ball style into Carey's gloves Siddle to Dhoni, 1 wide slower bouncer wide outside off, Dhoni leaves it alone Jhye Richardson to Kohli, OUT whoopsie. A huge moment for Australia, this. This is full, a half-volley on leg stump, and I don't know if Kohli was looking to hit this in the air, but he's flicked it, possibly a touch earlier than he wanted to, timed it perhaps better than he wanted to, and picked out the fielder at deep Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye back of a length, angling into Dhoni's left hip. Tucked away to long leg Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 wide back of a length, gets his line all wrong. With pretty much everyone in the circle on the off side, he doesn't want to give Dhoni any width, and he ends up whanging it down the leg side. Dhoni merely steps across and shoulders arms Behrendorff to Dhoni, SIX runs probably not. Back of a length on off stump, and MS Dhoni absolutely Dhonies this to bring up his fifty. Leans back, clears his front leg, and brings all that bottom-hand power into play to clear long-on as well.

The victory set up a series decider in Melbourne on Friday. When Kohli found deep midwicket shortly after reaching his 39th ODI hundred - one he celebrated in animated fashion - India still needed 57 off 38 balls and Dhoni had played a very sedate second fiddle to the captain. He launched Nathan Lyon for six and had just enough in the tank and the legs to ensure a meltdown on social media was perhaps avoided for now. He ensured the victory when he swung Jason Behrendorff over long-on with the first ball of the final over."
"6.12 pm QLD: Great guys, the news from Brisbane is that New Zealand have won the toss and opted to bowl. The match has been reduced to 22 overs-a-side. Game On!! Southee to Hopes, 1 wide down the leg side, tries to flick it away fine, misses, given a wide Mills to Hopes, OUT gone! Goes for a wild swing over long-on, fraction full on the off stump, is not to the pitch, the ball sails high and Vettori at mid-off takes a well judged catch after waiting for ages for it to get to him Mills to Ponting, OUT Gone!! Full outside off and moves away, Ponting's fishing for it off the front foot, gets a thin edge straight to the keeper. New Zealand have struck early here O'Brien to Hussey, OUT gone, wild swing and pays the price! Full on middle and leg, Hussey makes room to smash it over mid-on, it came back in a a touch and crashed into leg stump. Australia in a spot of bother now at 30 for 3 Vettori to Hussey, OUT gone! What an inspired bowling change!! Short on middle and off, there to hit, he pulls it away straight to Diamanti stationed perfectly at deep midwicket. Big wicket for New Zealand The small cover is on, presumably to keep the pitch dry after a slight drizzle during the break. The Australians are having fielding drills in the outfield. The covers are off, and the pitch is being rolled. The New Zealand openers have come out - McCullum and Guptill. Hilfenhaus to Fulton, 1 wide full toss down the leg side, Fulton misses an opportunity there, given a wide Johnson to Taylor, OUT he's gifted his wicket here after a superb shot the previous ball! Good length outside off, tries to swat it over the bowler's head, gets the top-edge and Hussey at cover takes a well-judged catch as it takes forever to come down It has started raining pretty heavily in Brisbane now.

Getty Images Australia clung to the Chappell-Hadlee Series despite a brave push from New Zealand after the final game was spoilt by rain. Martin Guptill's fighting half-century was in vain as the visitors finished at 6 for 123; they were ahead on Duckworth-Lewis but needed to make the target of 156 in 20 overs to qualify the contest as a match. The result left the series drawn at 2-2 and Australia kept the prize after their win in 2007-08. It was a sad end for New Zealand after a day that swung from saturated to soggy and slippery. New Zealand started their innings after Australia's 4 for 168 and relied on Guptill, who blasted his half-century from only 24 balls."
"New Zealand have won the toss and elected to bat first. Brendon McCullum will open the batting and keep wicket, Cumming comes into the NZ side for Jeetan Patel while the Australian team is unchanged. Johnson to Guptill, OUT gone! Johnson pitches one short on the middle and leg stump this time around and hurries Guptill into the stroke. He manages to get some wood on the ball as he pulls it straight into the hands of Bracken, positioned at fine-leg exactly for this Hopes to Fulton, OUT one more! Fulton falls now as he does not manage to keep the ball down as he plays an intended drive on the off side to Bracken at mid-on and Kiwis slip further now Johnson to Elliott, OUT short on the middle stump. Elliot does the pre-meditated shuffle and swats it in the gap between fine-leg and sweeper on the leg side. David Hussey, covers a lot of ground as he takes a good catch. It was more of a good catch from Hussey than a poor shot from El Hopes to Cumming, OUT gone! Cumming just manages to chip it to mid-off, where Johnson takes a straight-forward catch. It means Cumming has fluffed his chances in his first ODI in four years. Australia are in the driver's seat now Bracken to Taylor, 1 wide and begins with a wide delivery outside the off stump. He laughs it off but bet Ponting wont see the funnier side in it Hilfenhaus to Broom, 1 wide short and wide down the leg side and rightly called so Hilfenhaus to Broom, OUT it's all over for Broom. Hilfenhaus, pitches it short and Broom, spontaneously goes for the pull and ends up top edging it to Hopes, stationed at cover. Just when it looked like a partnership was coming on, a wicket falls Bracken to Taylor, 5 wide wide, far too wide outside the off stump. And what adds to Bracken's misery is the fine-leg fielder being inside the circle . He ends up conceding five wides Johnson to Taylor, OUT gone! Full-toss on the off stump. Taylor, moves across and looks to get cheeky as he wants to paddle it to fine-leg but the ball comes in faster than he expects. Taylor, manages to get a top edge which flies high. Haddin is calling for it right from the moment it Hilfenhaus to Taylor, 1 wide wide outside the off stump to begin the over Bracken to Mills, OUT timber! Mills is backing away even before the ball is bowled. Bracken notices it and bowls a yorker on the middle stump. Mills has a swing and there is only place where the ball can go- stumps- if he misses and it does go there Southee to Haddin, 1 wide wide down the leg side Mills to Ponting, 1 wide wayward delivery down the leg side Southee to Ponting, OUT and for the umpteenth time this summer we see Ponting top-edging a pull shot. Only difference this time being he does it to the cover fielder as Guptill takes it comfortably.

Getty Images The Hussey brothers ensured the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy would be decided by Friday's final match in Brisbane after they helped Australia to a six-wicket win that levelled the series 2-2. For the first time in the series New Zealand batted first and they posted a moderate 244, which on a good pitch was not enough against an Australian batting order starting to find form. The game was to some degree overshadowed by the Victorian bushfire appeal that surrounded it, with contributions from players, sponsors, spectators and administrators totalling just over $6 million. But while Australia had failed to beat South Africa at the same venue on Australia Day, this time they did get over the line at Adelaide on another special, if more sombre, occasion. Fittingly Michael Hussey brought up the win with a six over long-on, adding another $5000 to the tally after the Commonwealth Bank pledged that amount for every six in the game."

Finally a wicket but not after an excellent start by the Australian openers Elliott to Ponting, OUT top-edge and excellent catch at fine-leg by Mills, short of a length on middle and off, tries to pull it away over square leg, gets the leading edge and Mills, despite the sun being being in his eyes, pouches it superbly Vettori to Haddin, SIX runs Haddin is looking in great form here, tossed up on middle and leg, inviting the batsman to charge forward, lofts it cleanly over long-on for a big six. No sign of nerves here in the nineties for Haddin O'Brien to White, OUT poor shot, bowled on a good length on the off stump, he goes for a blind loft over mid-off, mistimes it completely, gets a lot of elevation on it, Vettori takes a couple of steps back and takes a well-judged catch Vettori to Ferguson, OUT plumb in front! Tossed up on middle, bowled really slow at 78 kmph, he is into the sweep shot really early, is done is by the pace, strikes him on the back leg on line with the stumps and Bucknor makes a straightforward decision O'Brien to Hopes, OUT full and straight, and it's timber! Yorker length on middle, Hopes makes room to slice that over point, misses it completely and hears the death rattle behind him Mills to Hussey, OUT Hussey holes out in the deep, slower ball bowled full on middle and leg, he gets forward and slogs it straight to Ross Taylor at deep midwicket. End of a cruical innings after the openers had given the hosts a sound start Mills to Johnson, OUT gone! Slower ball on middle and leg, slogged away straight to Jeetan Patel at deep midwicket. Hilfenhaus to Taylor, OUT he's given him! Good length on middle, and held its line this time. Taylor came forward to defend, missed it completely and was struck in line. Correct decision there, Taylor showed his bat to the umpire immediately upon being struck on the pads, but Bucknor is having none of the nonsense Hopes to Fulton, 4 leg byes appeal for lbw, good length on middle and off, tries to drive that wide of midwicket, clips the pads on the way to the third-man boundary. Huge appeal for lbw, and it seemed as though it struck him in line. Bucknor shakes his head and Hopes is unlucky Johnson to Elliott, 1 wide wide down the leg side, tries to flick it away fine, misses, given a wide Bracken to Southee, SIX runs that's disappeared! SLower ball bowled full on middle and leg, he picked and slogged it away well over the deep midwicket boundary for a massive six Hilfenhaus to McCullum, 1 wide wide down the leg side, given Hilfenhaus to McCullum, OUT that's it, almost all over for New Zealand, full toss outside off stump, tries to smash it over the covers, mistimes it straight to Ponting who's standing there at the edge of the circle. The bat slips out of McCullum's hands as he goes for the shot Bracken to Patel, SIX runs big one! Excellent shot, he got stuck into that one, slower ball bowled full on middle, swung away off the front foot over deep midwicket for a six New Zealand batted well to reach where they did, and when Elliott and McCullum were going strong, a win could not have been ruled out. Partnerships were the key for New Zealand as their middle order put together productive stands at a fairly good rate, despite a poor start.

Getty Images Australia's influx of youth has dominated discussion of late, but it was the team's mainstays who completed a successful series-salvaging mission at the SCG. Brad Haddin's maiden one-day international century was complemented by half-centuries to Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey, propelling Australia to an intimidating 9 for 301 that proved just beyond the grasp of the hard-finishing New Zealand. The hosts appeared set for a comfortable victory at the fall of Tim Southee's wicket in the 37th over, but a brilliant partnership of 69 from 49 deliveries between Grant Elliott, who struck 115 from 124 balls, and the injured Brendon McCullum (36 from 27) raised hopes of a stunning upset. McCullum, playing with the assistance of a pain-killing injection after hurting his shoulder in the field, punished Nathan Bracken from the uncustomary position of No. 9, while Elliott adopted a more measured approach in compiling his maiden limited-overs hundred."
"O'Brien to Hussey, OUT direct hit and David Hussey's got to go!

Getty Images Michael Clarke's 98 could not stop his unthinkable series loss from coming a step closer after Grant Elliott kept a cool head to complete a six-wicket victory for New Zealand, who were solid without being spectacular. Despite making hard work of a less than imposing chase of 226, New Zealand got home with seven balls to spare to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. On a day when the glitzy IPL auction caught the attention of much of the cricketing world, Australia and New Zealand combined to produce a distinctly unglamorous match that was hardly the best advertisement for the 50-over format. It was a throwback to the 1980s, when 220 was considered a good target and top-order men like Geoff Marsh and John Wright were commended for compiling 50 off 90 balls. The lack of prettiness did not worry New Zealand, who gave their countrymen another reason to celebrate Waitangi Day when Elliott brought up the win with a pull for four off Ben Hilfenhaus."

Taylor guided the tentative chase of the home team's below-par 181 and carried an order of novices before Daniel Vettori sealed the success with a glide behind point. The timing of New Zealand's batting Powerplay was crucial - it came with eight overs to go - as they went from heading towards a troubling loss to redirecting course. Mills, who had already earned four wickets, picked up consecutive boundaries off Nathan Bracken (3 for 38) in a 12-run over that was followed by 11 from Shaun Tait, including a brave six swiped over midwicket by Taylor. There was a late shift when Mills went for 26 from 35 balls and Taylor was caught by Michael Clarke for 64 off 97."

He tries to deposit him over deep midwicket but the ball sails over deep point instead, what bat speed Harwood to van der Merwe, OUT he goes for 48, Harwood drops it short and van der Merwe makes room to slice it through the off side, the short length foxes him and he has no room to work with and as a result he gets a faint edge to Haddin Laughlin to Boucher, 1 leg bye bangs it in short and Boucher takes his eyes off the ball as he shapes to pull and the ball rolls off the body, Laughlin attempts an athletic under arm flick The players are out in the middle, and Johann Louw is set to open the proceedings Louw to Clarke, 1 wide He starts off with a very wide one outside offstump Abdulla to Warner, 1 wide follows that up with one down the leg side, that's a wide Morkel to Warner, OUT Morkel gets the breakthrough South Africa needed so badly, Warner is bowled by a full delivery on middle and off, Warner comes down the track and tries to loft it down the ground, misses the ball and his stumps are shattered Abdulla to Ponting, OUT Ponting's gone this time, caught behind pushing at a length ball, he was ill at ease in his first two deliveries as well, and this one comes in a fraction after pitching outside off, Ponting took a big stride forward to drive, feathered it throu Morkel to Clarke, 1 wide wide down the leg side from Albie Morkel van der Merwe to Hopes, 1 leg bye Hopes goes for the sweep to a full ball outside off, doesn't make contact and the ball cannons off the pads towards backward point Morkel to Hopes, SIX runs Hopes provides them with one of those, swats the final ball of the over into the crowd behind midwicket Louw to Hopes, OUT Hopes is gone, deceived by the slower one, good thinking from Louw, Hopes was coming down the track, he sent in a shorter, slower one, which Hopes mishits to midwicket, Albie takes a diving catch to send Hopes on his way Louw to Haddin, SIX runs swatted to the long-on boundary, could have been another wicket if Duminy had held on to that, he only manages to push the ball over the boundary Player of the match is Roelof van der Merwe, SA","South Africa 156 for 5 (van der Merwe 48, Peterson 34, Harwood 2-21) beat Australia 139 for 8 (Hussey 27, Clarke 27, Botha 2-16) by 17 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out South Africa were saved by the brutal contribution of Roelof van der Merwe in the twilight overs AFP The South Africans continue to dominate the limited-overs formats. Having usurped Australia for top place in the 50-over rankings last year, South Africa now head to the World Twenty20 brimming with confidence after a second consecutive 20-over victory over Ricky Ponting's men, this time by 17 runs. The Australians seldom appeared comfortable in pursuit of South Africa's 156 for 5 on a pitch that troubled batsmen from both sides of the Indian Ocean. Michael Clarke (27 runs from 33 balls) struggled to combat South Africa's disciplined lines, while Ricky Ponting was dismissed for a solitary run for the second time in three days; this time to a well-angled delivery from debutant paceman Yusuf Abdulla. Hardly an ideal start."
"The news from the Wanderers is that South Africa have won the toss and opted to field. Parnell to Clarke, OUT timber! Parnell gets one, fullish on the off stump, held its line, Clarke had decided he would go after that one, bowled at 143 kmph, he makes room to smash that over extra cover, misses and the stumps take a beating! Morkel to Ponting, OUT poor shot really, hit a good length on middle and leg, Ponting stayed in his crease and tried to clear mid-on, wasn't to the pitch at all, ended up mistiming it towards Johan Botha who ran a few steps back and pouched it gleefully. Morkel to Warner, SIX runs change of pace but Warner picked the slower one, landed full on middle, he took a step forward, got under it nicely and lofted it cleanly over the long-on boundary Botha to Hussey, SIX runs that's disappeared, timely hit, flighted on the off stump, much slower through the air, Hussey's eyes light up, he gets under it and dismisses it over the long-on boundary Peterson to Warner, OUT excellent reflexes by Peterson! Bowled full on the off stump, Warner picks the length and swats it firmly but straight towards the bowler, Peterson reacts well, bends down and takes it low. Peterson to Haddin, OUT he's thrown it away! Flighted on the off stump, lands on a good length, Haddin lofts it lazily, no intent whatsoever in that stroke, finds Albie Morkel at long-off positioned exactly for some poor batting like that Parnell to Hussey, SIX runs gets hold of it this time, bowled round the wicket, full outside off, reaches for it and creams it over the extra-cover boundary, went about 10-15 rows into the crowd Peterson to Hussey, SIX runs slogged away and it's over the ropes, full and straight on the off stump, bowled quick, heaves it over the deep midwicket boundary, reaches his 50 in style Peterson to White, OUT identical stroke but not the result, struck it well but the ball was bowled much slower through the air, heaved it, but straight to deep midwicket where Duminy judges it to perfection Morkel to Hussey, 1 wide straying down the leg side, given a wide, the first one in a long time Parnell to Johnson, OUT bowled 'im! Good stuff from Parnell, in the blockhole on middle, Johnson tries to dig it out on the leg side but is a little too late in bringing his bat down, misses and the stumps are rattled Harwood to Amla, 1 wide bouncer outside leg stump, erring in line here, given a wide Harwood to Gibbs, SIX runs Harwood's being punished, bowled on a good length outside off, Gibbs charges down the track and smashes it over the extra-cover boundary Harwood to Amla, 1 wide driving length outside off and Amla goes for it, moves away after pitching, the batsman misses, and the bowler is awarded with a wide called by the umpire, a little too harsh there Hopes to Duminy, 1 wide slower ball outside leg stump, cut back in to miss the leg stump but it's still down the leg side, given a wide Hopes to Duminy, OUT big wicket! Just when it seemed Duminy was helping his team claw back, Hopes has uprooted his off stump. Short of a length and Duminy is tempted to go for a cross-batted pull over midwicket, the ball keeps a little low, he misses and the sticks behind him take a beating. Johnson to Morkel, 1 wide starts with a wide down the leg side, Australia can afford one every now and then with the position they are in Johnson to Boucher, 1 wide bouncer banged in short on middle, called a wide, rightly so, it's too high Harwood to Morkel, 1 leg bye full on the leg stump, should have glanced it down fine but misses, is struck on the pads and they get a leg bye Johnson to Botha, 1 wide wide down the leg side, only just though, short of a length on the leg stump and moved down, Botha let it go Johnson to Botha, 1 leg bye full on leg stump, swung in to strike him on the pads, they get a leg bye towards third man, would have gone down South Africa were in deep trouble at one stage - they were 83 for 5 - but Boucher and Morkel sparked a revival with a stand of 58 for the sixth wicket. Morkel fell for a superb 19-ball 37 but Boucher stayed till the end, repeating his feat in that famous chase of 434, to guide his team to a thrilling four-wicket win. South Africa won by 4 wickets (with 4 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Hussey, AUS","Johan Botha, the South Africa captain, praised the performances of Mark Boucher and Albie Morkel after they showed why they get paid ""the big bucks"" in the tight four-wicket Twenty20 win over Australia. Boucher and Morkel concluded the hosts' recovery from 83 for 5 to reach 168 for 6 with four balls remaining. ""It got a bit tight but you know with those two out there, that's why they get paid the big bucks,"" Botha told AAP. ""They do it under pressure and they did it again tonight. ""With those two in with a long way to go, we knew we still had a chance."
"Jadeja to Khawaja, OUT LBW! He's given out sweeping! Khawaja has reviewed it. It was fired in flat and straight, it did turn a touch, he tried to sweep from a length, no hot spot, no spike on RTS, he has missed it, he was hit on the knee infront of middle and off, Hawkeye has i Bhuvneshwar to Marsh, 1 leg bye length ball, pitching outside leg and keeping a bit low to rap the batsman near the knee rolls, an appeal for lbw but not out, says the umpire. They sneak in a leg-bye though Kuldeep to Marsh, OUT flighted on the stumps, Marsh skips down and looks to clear long-on, doesn't middle it and Shami comes forward and takes a low tumbling catch Shami to Handscomb, 1 wide a full toss but down the leg side, lucky for Shami that Handscomb didn't any bat on it Shami to Handscomb, 1 wide comes down the track but Shami sees that and slips in a bouncer, Handscomb looks to pull but that's too high Bhuvneshwar to Stoinis, 1 wide slower one outside off, but way too wide, needs to be bowled again Behrendorff to S Dhawan, OUT LBW! Given out and Dhawan walks off! Behrendorff gets his first. Fuller length, it nipped back off the seam, Dhawan's head falls over, it beats the inside edge and hits him plumb on the shin in front of off! No doubt about that one. Jhye Richardson to Kohli, OUT caught at square leg! Oh no! He's nailed this off his pads straight to Marcus Stoinis at forward square! It was 138kph, nearly a half-volley on leg stump, he pinged it off his pads but in the air, waist high, straight to Stoinis, he sucked his stoma Jhye Richardson to Rayudu, OUT LBW! Rayudu has a long chat with Rohit and he decides to review. This was full and fast, it angled in and didn't swing, beat the inside edge, nothing on hot spot, hit below the knee roll. It was smashing into leg stump! OUT! Three reds light up on Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs 133kph, full on leg stump, he flicks this high and long to deep square, Marsh on the rope catches it and parries it back in but his heel was touching the padding of the rope! After a long delay it's signalled six! Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 wide 137kph, sprayed down the leg side, and called wide Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 wide 138kph, short and swinging way wide of off stump, he leaves, it's too wide Lyon to Dhoni, SIX runs here we go, he skips down and launches this way back over long on! MS Dhoni of old, he just got down to the pitch and thumped it way over the fence, 25 rows back! Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 wide an attempted bouncer, down the leg side and balloons over Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye fuller in the stumps, goes back and flicks it behind square leg Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 wide a bouncer this time, but down the leg side and called a wide Jhye Richardson to Dhoni, 1 leg bye length on middle and leg, flicked towards fine leg Lyon to Dhoni, 1 leg bye length again, Dhoni uses his feet and misses, hits on the pads, but way too down the wicket, a leg-bye to extra cover Behrendorff to Dhoni, 1 leg bye length on middle and leg, tucked away towards square leg Lyon to Rohit Sharma, SIX runs he stands still, it's in the arc, and he launches it over long on and into the crowd! Great strike! Jhye Richardson to Jadeja, OUT caught at deep backward point! He bowled a quick short ball, Jadeja backs away and upper cuts, he flushes it but gets it too square, it goes all the way to Marsh on the rope, he settles and takes the catch! Four for Richardson Stoinis to Rohit Sharma, 1 wide 126kph slower ball, gets it wrong, sprays way wide of off and called a wide Siddle to Kuldeep, OUT caught at deep backward square! Khawaja holds one! Slower ball, shorter, he steps outside off and pulls this in the air to deep backward square, Khawaja waits again, but he clings onto this one and Siddle has a wicket! Australia go 1-0 up in the three match series. The next game is in Adelaide on Tuesday. On behalf of all the team thanks for your company tonight. Look out for Andrew McGlashan's post-game coverage from the SCG. For now goodbye, and hopefully we see you Tuesday. Player of the match is Jhye Richardson, AUS","Australia 5 for 288 (Handscomb 73, Khawaja 59, S Marsh 54) beat India 254 for 9 (Rohit 133, Dhoni 51, Richardson 4-26) by 34 runs They just needed a new kit. Despite a fine century from Rohit Sharma, Australia ripped up the form book with a 34-run victory in the first ODI at the SCG. Jhye Richardson bowled superbly to take 4 for 26, which ensured a solid if unspectacular display from their Test match turned one-day top order was enough for a much-needed win. After ODI debutant Jason Behrendorff struck with his sixth ball, Richardson claimed two wickets in three balls in his second over, the first of them Virat Kohli, as India crashed to 3 for 4 inside four overs in their chase of 289. Rohit kept them in the contest with his 22nd ODI century, adding 137 for the fourth wicket with MS Dhoni 28 overs."
"Steyn to Clarke, OUT Clarke has been cleaned up by Steyn. What an awesome delivery. It landed slightly short in length on the off stump line and straightened to hit the off. Clarke pushed inside the line and heard the death rattle.Not so awesome on replay. It was a very good delivery indeed but it landed Harris to Katich, OUT Kato is gone. The readers have woofed him out I think. What an uncharacteristic shot. It was on a length outside off stump, Katich dragged it from there, attempting a sweep shot but could only top edge it to close on the leg side and Imraan Khan takes his first Test catch. Remember h Harris to Haddin, OUT Trapped in front but Haddin, after checking with the non-striker, has gone for the review. It landed on the middle stump line, skidded through quickly to rap him on the pad in front of middle and leg. That's dead duck. No inside edge and the height looks ok as well. Bucknor got it ri Ntini to McDonald, OUT Ntini's patience has paid off. McDonald walked across outside off again. Ntini kept it full and even further outside off. McDonald went for the cover drive but edged it into the bucket hands of Kallis at first slip. Ntini to Siddle, OUT Ntini takes out Siddle. He straightens a length delivery outside off and Siddle lunges forward to stab it to left of second slip where AB swallows it. Out for a duck. Eight for 190. Harris to McGain, 1 leg bye drifts towards the pad, rolls away to fine leg Steyn to Johnson, OUT Mitch is gone, going for a six. It was a length delivery and a tad slower as well and Johnson got under the ball more than he wanted and got elevation instead of distance. Prince ran to his left from long-on to hold on to the ball. Nine down. Steyn to McGain, OUT 209 all out. Full and straight outside off, McGain is caught at the crease and hangs his bat out and stabs it to third slip. Good disciplined show from South Africa to bowl out Australia for 209. How will their batsmen go about their task? Remember, they have new openers. Join us in a short while for the reply. Siddle to Boucher, 1 bye gets this to straighten outside off stump and Bad Hands days of Brad Haddin returns. He doesn't take it cleanly and this is no 53, the highest no of extras Australia have ever conceded in a Test. Johnson to Boucher, OUT Caught at second slip. Poor stuff from Boucher. He had just edged one through the cordon and he goes hard at another full delivery slanting across him. Edge and gone! Australia have done well today to take out three wickets. Hilfenhaus to Morkel, 1 leg bye fullish, tires to flick it and it rolls off the pad to square leg McGain to Morkel, SIX runs Flighted up, aiming for the rough but Albie waltzes down the track to the pitch of the ball and swings it high and long over long-on into the delirious crowd. Well .. I expect them to be delirious. Albie's first Test six. McDonald to de Villiers, SIX runs McDonald helps AB by pitching this one even shorter and de Villiers says thanks for the gift and rips it to the crowd behind deep midwicket. up up and over. McDonald to Morkel, OUT And a wicket to end the over where AB smoked 4 sixes. It landed on a length around middle and leg and moved towards middle and off, Albie had a lazy waft at it, missed it completely and was cleaned up. Not an attacking shot, just a defensive waft Johnson to Harris, 1 wide from round the stumps, hurls a wide delivery outside off stump. The extras keep piling up. McDonald to Harris, 1 leg bye yorker ,drifting outside leg and off the pad to fine leg. AB is on strike. Katich to de Villiers, OUT AB has holed out to deep midwicket. Short delivery, nothing special, could have disappeared out of the ground but AB pulls it straight to the fielder. What a fine entertaining innings from de Villiers. The crowd loved it and are now showing their appreciation with a generous th Katich to Steyn, OUT Lovely loopy slider from Katich who picks his second wicket. It looped up outside off, good rip on the ball and Steyn drove inside the line and edged it to slip. Questions will be asked why Ponting didn't bring Kato on earlier. Was the bowler reluctant or the captain? Press conferenc So South Africa all out for 651. They lead by 442. A mountain to climb. AB indulged himself, Albie had fun and even Harris threw his bat around. Much fun for the crowd. That's tea as well. Join us in a while for the final session. Player of the match is Paul Harris, SA","South Africa 651 (de Villiers 163, Prince 150, Kallis 102) beat Australia 209 (Katich 55, Steyn 4-56) and 422 (Johnson 123*, McDonald 68, Katich 54, Harris 6-127) by an innings and 20 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Mitchell Johnson's maiden century was a stirring affair and gave South Africa palpitations before they eventually won AFP Minor lapses in concentration were always going to be crucial on a day like this. For two sessions it was Australia who paid for erring, and in the final it was South Africa - having stuck to their task so well until tea - who relaxed and looked on in bewilderment as centurion Mitchell Johnson and Andrew McDonald thumped a rearguard of dizzying proportions. In the end, however, Australia were unable to overcome a massive deficit and fell to an innings defeat - 11 years and a day to the last time that happened. With the score reading 231 for 6 at tea, South Africa were in charge but things went pear-shaped after the interval. Truly, final sessions have seldom had so much packed in them."
"Australia must have been eyeing a score of well above 400 after that opening stand but lost their way badly, particularly today. They lost their last six wickets for just 23 - and their last five for just 4 - as the South African seamers tore away at them, troubling their batsmen especially with the short ball. The pitch has helped the bowlers today so Johnson and Hilfenhaus will bank on some assistance. Siddle to Steyn, 1 leg bye well played by Steyn, short on leg stump, fends it away but uses his arm guard and not his gloves like the ones who preceded him Australia will bat on so no follow-on. They lead by 214, a massive one as they look to close out the series. It was all over before you could blink. Steyn flashed at a wide one and Ntini was trapped in front the following ball. Siddle will be on a hat-trick when he takes the new ball soon. It's been a superb turnaround by the Australians after they collapsed yesterday morning. They'll look to pile on the Innings Start North changes ends","Australia 352 (Hughes 115, Katich 108) and 331 for 5 dec (Hughes 160, Ponting 81) beat South Africa 138 (Duminy 73*, Johnson 3-37, McDonald 3-25) and 370 (Kallis 93, de Villiers 84, Siddle 3-61, Katich 3-45) by 175 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out AB de Villiers made a fine 84 before Peter Siddle ended his resistance AFP The transitional period is over. An emphatic series win in South Africa will imbue Australia with confidence that, after a harrowing six-month search, they have uncovered a crop of cricketers capable of competing with the world's best. The Australians sealed a comprehensive 175-run victory at Kingsmead shortly before tea on the fifth day, prompting scenes of jubilation from a team barely recognisable to that which last tasted series success on South African shores. In claiming an unassailable 2-0 series lead, Ricky Ponting's band of rookies defended the No. 1 Test ranking earned by their venerable forebears and created a difficult situation for Andrew Hilditch's selection panel when the likes of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark and Andrew Symonds return in the coming months."
"Arafat to Clarke, 1 wide straying in line now, pushed it wide of leg stump, given a wide, Pakistan have a looked sloppy after that double-strike Malik to Haddin, OUT bowled'im! A conventional offpsinner, landed on the off and spun in, Haddin moves well across to turn it into the leg side, missed and the ball clipped the leg stump, exposed his stumps there and paid the price Afridi to Symonds, OUT trapped in front, held its line, landed on a good length on middle, was half-forward while playing at it, was expecting it to turn away but was beaten by the straighter one to be struck in line, big blow that, the spinners have done it again Malik to Ferguson, 1 leg bye on middle and leg, pushed away wide of midwicket Afridi to Clarke, OUT caught and bowled, stopped on him a little, dropped it short, spun away, stepped out of the crease and pushed at it, lobbed it straight to Afridi who took a dolly, went through with the shot there, didn't try to adjust to the spin, and paid the price Umar Gul to Ferguson, OUT was in the slot, struck it well, had a nice swing at it but there was fielder there perfectly positioned for that shot, hit towards long-on where Tanvir just had to take a couple of steps back to snap that one Ajmal to Hussey, 1 leg bye tossed up outside off, worked it away behind square for a single Umar Gul to Hussey, OUT gone! Slower one, bowled short on the off, an offcutter that, Hussey failed to pick it, struggled all the way through, tried to pull it over deep square leg, got the top edge as he was a little early into the shot, easy catch to Arafat Pakistan will fancy chasing this. Australia completely lost the plot in the middle overs, once the spinners came on. It was the combo of Afridi and Malik that did the damage, who kept the leash on Clarke and Haddin during their stand. Wickets kept falling at fairly frequent intervals, and even in the last ten, once the seamers came back on, It all went downhill from then on, as batsman after batsman either got out playing a needless shot, or was done in by some genuinely good bowling. Australia kept the pressure on as soon as they sniffed a chance at a comeback, and once they had seized the advantage, they didn't take too long to complete the formalities, despite a determined Player of the match is Michael Clarke, AUS","Australia 198 for 7 (Clarke 66, Ferguson 41, Gul 3-38, Afridi 2-31) beat Pakistan 171 (Butt 48, Shehzad 40, Clarke 3-15, Hauritz 2-25 ) by 27 runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Michael Clarke's return to form couldn't have come at a better moment Associated Press Pakistan's propensity to self-destruct cost them the lead in this series in dramatic manner, a batting collapse against spin handing Australia an improbable win. Michael Clarke, the Australian captain, turned in a superb all-round performance with a gritty 66 in the face of some penetrative spin bowling before picking up 3 for 15 amid Pakistan's middle-order chaos. His spin partners, Nathan Hauritz and Andrew Symonds, helped defend a below-par score of 198 as Pakistan fell short by 27 runs. Spinners have been making headlines in the IPL in South Africa and the story today wasn't any different in the northern hemisphere. Pakistan's own spin trio strangled the runs and picked up three wickets and, by the time their openers Salman Butt and Ahmed Shehzad added 95, the hosts looked set for a series lead."
"2.26 pm: We'll get you the details from the toss shortly. The news is that Pakistan have won the toss and opted to bat. Nasir Jamshed is out injured, and in comes Ahmed Shehzad, who makes his debut.

So still no Hopes to Salman Butt, 1 leg bye tries to tuck it away behind square, gets a legbye as it brushes his thighs Laughlin to Younis, OUT he strikes immediately! A tame dismissal really, short and wide, goes for the cut, swings away as he plays the shot, takes the outside edge and Haddin makes no mistake Hauritz to Malik, OUT well caught by Haddin, bowled it a touch flat outside off, Malik charged down the pitch and had a massive swing at it, got the inside edge as it spun in, hit the boot and lobbed up in front of Haddin who dived to pluck it inches from the ground, it's been referred to the third umpire who rightly gives it OUT after taking ages to Hauritz to Misbah, OUT Misbah goes for the reverse-sweep and finds David Husey at short third, quicker on outside off and he tries to help it on its way, went really quickly towards Hussey to dived full length to his right to pluck a sharp one, stayed alert throughout Hauritz to Salman Butt, OUT Hauritz takes three, dipped into him and appeared to stop on him a little, chips it, with hardly any conviction, straight to Symonds who dives forward at cover Laughlin to Afridi, 1 leg bye slower ball, at 115.5 kmph, on leg stump, was probably going down as he missed a pull, should have dismissed that, will be ruing it now Laughlin to Afridi, SIX runs he's got under it nicely, was in the slot, slower ball bowled full on the off, meaty, and he smashed it over long-on, came off the middle Hopes to Afridi, OUT edged and Haddin flings himself to his right to snap that out of thin air, superb catch! Fraction full on the off, makes room while simultaneously stepping out, tries to launch it over the in-field on the off side, gets a thick edge and the keeper pulls off a beauty. Big blow that!

Symonds to Umar Gul, OUT flighted outside off, bent down, got down on one knee to sweep that over square leg, got the top edge and Hauritz ran well to his left from deep square leg, timed his dive well, and made amends for that drop earlier Symonds to Shoaib Akhtar, OUT superb catch by Clarke! Short on the off, gets back and punches it hard, almost clears cover but Clarke leaps and plucks it with his left hand out of thin air to send Shoaib back Pakistan will rue the fact that they didn't bat out 50 overs. 207 is competitive, but the Australians will back themselves to chase it down. Pakistan, on this pitch, will again bank on their spinners to do the job.

His two-wicket over, in the face of a marauding Shoaib Akhtar, had kept Pakistan down to a par total, but his bigger contribution came with the bat when Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal threatened to run through Australia for the second time in a row. Afridi and Ajmal had undone James Hopes' good work at the top, bringing the game right back into the balance, when Symonds came in to bat. Hopes, filling in for the injured Shaun Marsh at the top of the order, had put Australia on their way to a chase of a tricky 207, before Ajmal and Afridi struck in back-to-back overs. The contest was always going to come to life when the spinners came on."
"2.30 pm: Time for the toss. Australia have won the toss and opted to bat. Shaun Marsh, Shane Watson, Stuart Clark, Andrew Symonds and Ben Hilfenhaus are all in.

The devastation caused by Shahid Afridi's career-best 6 for 38 had all but shut Australia out of the match before the halfway stage of their innings. A late recovery pushed them to 168 but it wasn't enough to seriously challenge an unpredictable Pakistan outfit. Pakistan stuttered, rebuilt, stumbled again and a late push by Afridi, contributing an adrenalin-filled yet brief 24, pushed them towards a win.

"Morkel to Clarke, 2 leg byes landed on a good length outside off, gets way outside the line to turn it wide of mid-on, is struck on the pads, gets a couple of leg byes Morkel to Haddin, OUT he's got him! SA following up well on that maiden, full on the off stump, Haddin makes room to cart that over the infield on the off side, ends up slicing it really high and Duminy at deep cover, positioned perfectly, just had to take few steps to his right to complete an easy catch van der Merwe to Ferguson, OUT Fergie goes! An abrupt end to a good stand, quicker one the off stump, lands full, he drives through the line but ends up chipping it straight to de Villiers at short cover who takes a sharp chance Duminy to Ponting, OUT tossed up on the stumps this time and is tempted to go at it again, strikes it clean and high but not well enough as he fails to beat van der Merwe at long-on who takes a well-judged catch. Duminy does the trick. Duminy to Hussey, 1 wide, OUT a leg-side stumping, tossed up on middle and leg, drawing David Hussey out of the crease as he tries to work that away behind square, the ball spins down, the batsman misses and Boucher clips the bails to find him well short Duminy to Hopes, 1 wide another one, it's brought them a wicket but he's doing it too often Duminy to Johnson, OUT short on middle, pushes it back uppishly towards Duminy who dives forward and to his left to pluck it inches off the ground, or so it seemed. Duminy wasn't sure himself and asked the umpire to call for a replay, which then confirmed he had just about managed to get his hands around it. Steyn to Hauritz, 1 wide short of a length outside off, but a little too wide, chases it but fails to connect Steyn to Hussey, 1 wide and again, poor bowling this, attempted the slower one this time but got his direction totally wrong Ferguson proved an important wicket as he had brought the momentum back with the visitors with a fluent 41 and the openers had departed. Ponting got a start but never looked dominant; and Hussey, along with Hauritz, dealt some useful blows in the end to take his team past 300. South Africa, though, have the wherewithal to chase this down, but with the pitch getting a little slow, their Laughlin to Gibbs, 1 wide false start, full and wide and swinging away further, deservedly called a wide Laughlin to Kallis, SIX runs banged in short and Kallis is onto it quickly, spots the length early, gets back and pulls it away well wide of deep square leg for a six Hauritz to Gibbs, 2 byes straying on the pads, paddles it really fine, well wide of fine leg for two more Hauritz to Morkel, OUT Laughlin, you genius!! Tossed up outside off, and Albie goes for the slog-sweep, Laughlin's right at the edge of the ropes at deep midwicket and for a good while it appears the ball will clear him easily, but he waits, and times his jump to perfection to snap that over his head inches in front of the ropes, and celebrates kicking it Aussie-rules style back Spin had done the trick for South Africa when they bowled, but it was Bracken who turned things Australia's way with the wicket of Kallis. Not that the Australia spinners were ineffective; Hauritz chipped in with 2 for 34, including the important wicket of Albie towards the end, who was caught stunningly by Laughlin, a wicket that proved critical in the outcome. Australia have taken the No.2 spot with that win. They won it comfortably in the end, given the margin, but there was a time when Gibbs and Kallis were going strong, when it seemed South Africa could pull it off. Player of the match is Nathan Hauritz, AUS","Australia 303 for 7 (Clarke 66, Haddin 62, Duminy 3-48) beat South Africa 256 (Gibbs 82, Kallis 64, Johnson 3-58) by 47 runs Scorecard and ball-by-details How they were out Ben Laughlin's stunning catch to dismiss Albie Morkel turned the game firmly in Australia's favour Associated Press It may have been a dead rubber at the end of a long summer, but a resolute Australia scrapped hard in the field to secure a consolation win in Johannesburg and move up to No. 2 in the ODI rankings. Both innings in the match followed a similar pattern: significant contributions from the top four before the middle order collapsed. Michael Hussey remained unbeaten to make sure Australia capitalised on the batting Powerplay and shepherded them past 300, but none of the South African batsmen played that role, leaving the tail too much to do.

Bracken pushed it full this time, on middle, Gibbs made room and attempted to loft that over long-on, timed it well but not well enough, found Clarke in the deep who took it comfortably Johnson to Morkel, OUT bowled'im!

Australia, who again battled against the spin of Roelof van der Merwe, were seldom in the hunt.

Akmal's knock off 115 balls, his fifth ODI century, meant he top scored in both of Pakistan's successful run-chases this series and begged the question as to why he had not batted in the top four throughout. Akmal combined superbly with Misbah-ul-Haq to reel in Australia's total, the highest run-chase of this tough series, after being thrust together with Pakistan in trouble at 56 for 3. Their unbroken stand of 198 was an ODI record for the fourth wicket against Australia. Misbah was the ideal foil for Akmal, who was ignited by Misbah's energetic running, and the pair complimented each other perfectly to frustrate the Australian bowlers."
"Hauritz to Shehzad, 1 leg bye on middle and off, tries to paddle it fine, didn't connect, lobbed up off his pads Clarke to Misbah, OUT plumb, tossed up on middle, went for the sweep after three dot balls, tried to get it behind square, it straightened, he missed and was struck on the back pad in line with the stumps. Bowden raised his finger immediately Hauritz to Shehzad, OUT his patience was tested and finally, when offered some flight, failed to resist the temptation. Landed full on the off stump, went for a mighty slog-sweep over midwicket, it spun in, took the top-edge and stuck safely in the palms of Ferguson at long-on Bollinger to Malik, OUT looked plumb, nipped back in from the off, he got forward to defend but was struck just in line, didn't get across enough and played with bat really close to pad Clark to Kamran, OUT kept low and pegged back the offstump, short of a good length bowled at 132 kmph, failed to get his bat down in time and timber! Bollinger to Afridi, OUT gone! Big wicket! Short on middle, gets more bounce and is pacy, bowled at 135 kmph, goes for a mighty pull, gets the top edge as it comes on a little too quickly and North takes an easy catch at mid-on Bollinger to Arafat, 1 leg bye short outside leg stump and cut back in, tried to shuffle and work it behind square, was struck on the pads and high Bracken to Tanvir, OUT gone this time! Identical shot, gets the top edge again but is unfortunate it's not Watson under it again, got it much straighter and Hauritz at mid-on shows his team-mate how it's done Bollinger to Ajmal, OUT Bollinger gets five!! The legcutter, bowled at around 135 kmph, landed on a good length on middle and cut away to beat the bat and clip off stump Bolly leads the team off the field, after taking a five-for in just his second ODI. Australia have the clear edge, and Pakistan, who had got themselves into a decent position at 116 for 3, lost their last seven wickets for 81. Malik to Clarke, 1 leg bye quicker ball bowled flat on middle and leg, tries to turn it away, brushes the pads and they get a leg bye Doug Bollinger is the Man of the Match for his five-wicket haul. A thumping in the end. 197 on this pitch, one felt, was still competitive but it took a lot of grit and concentration from both these batsmen to pull it off quite comfortably in the end. Australia won by 8 wickets (with 34 balls remaining) Player of the match is Doug Bollinger, AUS","Australia 200 for 2 (Clarke 100*, Watson 85*) beat Pakistan 197 (Ahmed Shehzad 43, Shahid Afridi 40, Bollinger 5-35) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Doug Bollinger's five wickets set up Australia's series win, and earned him the Man-of-the-Match award Associated Press Stand-in Australian captain Michael Clarke produced a superb century to seal the five-match series with a game to spare after an eight-wicket win in Abu Dhabi. An unbeaten hundred, his fourth in one-day cricket and first as captain, was arguably his finest and was the key to Australia's comfortable pursuit of Pakistan's 197. Clarke and Shane Watson combined for a record-breaking 197-run partnership to lift Australia from its knees after Shoaib Akhtar wound back the clock with two early wickets in a blistering opening spell. Shoaib, on return after being left out of game three, claimed Brad Haddin and debutant Marcus North to leave Australia reeling at 3 for 2. But Clarke and Watson negotiated the rest of Shoaib's sharp four-over opening spell before flourishing under the floodlights."
"Angelo Mathews to Warner, OUT got him! Slightly shorter by Matthews and Warner cuts and slaps it straight into the hands of point! Malinga to Ponting, 2 wide a full bunger down the leg side Mendis to Ponting, OUT bowled him! Ponting stepped outside leg trying to smite him over cover but loses his leg stump. Looked to me like a leggie from Mendis Mendis to Watson, OUT gone! Watson attempts a horrible sweep to this very full and straight delivery, and he's hit on the back pad. Poor stroke - quality bowling Malinga to Haddin, OUT bowled him! Comical cricket. A slower full-toss which Haddin seemed to pick, but it dipped late on him and splattered his stumps - the off stump and middle stump both flattened Udana to Clarke, OUT another one done by a slower delivery. Are you watching, England? Superb delivery on middle-and-leg which Clarke picked, but got a leading edge back to the bowler who took a great low catch with his left hand Udana to Hussey, 1 wide another very slow ball but it's too wide this time to the left-hander Mendis to Hussey, OUT what bowling. What belief and guile from Mendis. A quicker and fuller ball to Hussey who's rapped absolutely dead in front. Too quick, too straight Murali to Johnson, SIX runs sheesh, that is huge. A massive slog sweep - the noise of bat on ball was sweet as a nut! The timing perfect Udana to Hussey, OUT tries to repeat the shot but slices it high and point swallows it with ease Udana to Lee, SIX runs nailed it! Absolutely creamed this full toss over wide long-on. Huge, ugly power and great to watch Malinga to Lee, OUT what a yorker. Oh well bowled! Very, very fast and hit the base of the leg stump which is sent cartwheeling Malinga to Hauritz, OUT outside edge, another one for Malinga - well caught by Sangakkara low to his right Lee to Jayasuriya, OUT what a catch from Warner at deep square leg! Jayasuriya pulled this hard and flat, and Warner jumped up high to take it behind him, not two feet from the boundary edge. Oh yes! Johnson to Dilshan, 1 wide well wide of the off stump Johnson to Mubarak, 1 wide and Australia are out of the ICC World Twenty20 with a wide down the leg side Sri Lanka won by 6 wickets (with 6 balls remaining) Player of the match is Kumar Sangakkara, SL","Sri Lanka 160 for 4 (Sangakkara 55*, Dilshan 53) beat Australia 159 for 9 (Johnson 28*, Mendis 3-20, Malinga 3-36) by six wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Kumar Sangakkara cracked a superb 55 Getty Images Sri Lanka eliminated Australia from the ICC World Twenty20 with a six-wicket victory at Trent Bridge. Kumar Sangakkara played a captain's innings to lead them across the line, with an over to spare, as they chased 160 after Tillakaratne Dilshan sparked the pursuit with an innovative 53 off 32 balls. Australia were set back by a magnificent display from Ajantha Mendis, who bamboozled with his variations, and although the match went to the final over Sri Lanka always held the edge to book their Super Eights berth. Australia's stay in this tournament - the international title they don't hold - lasted three days and now they face two extra weeks in Leicester to prepare for the Ashes series. Make no mistake, they desperately wanted to win this event, and further stock their trophy cabinet, but were short on their skills for the second game running against a highly impressive Sri Lanka outfit."
"Onions to Watson, OUT got him first ball! Cut back sharply on Watson who was a little late on this good, quick and straight delivery and that's out! Onions to Hussey, OUT he's bowled him! He's bowled him! Hussey has left a straight one and his off stump is pegged back! What a disastrous start for Australia Onions to Ponting, OUT got him! He's out! A quick bouncer, Ponting went for a hook and got a thin edge through to Prior. Onions has bowled so, so well this morning Anderson to North, 1 leg bye swinging down leg this time, North gets pad on it and gets a leg-bye Anderson to Clarke, OUT oh he's got him! A huge inswinger here, curves late and strikes Clarke on middle and leg, Rudi Koertzen lifts the finger Anderson to North, OUT wonderful catch! Prior makes a super take diving to his left across first slip. Fullish ball swinging away from North, who got a thick edge to one that he might have left alone Anderson to Johnson, OUT oh he's gone too! Swings back in to Johnson, who is in two minds whether to leave it - he does leave it - and it hits him above the knee-roll Broad to Manou, 1 leg bye an lbw appeal this time but that one is swinging down leg Anderson to Manou, OUT wow! What a delivery! Anderson comes a touch wider and gets the ball to straighten and it comprehensively smashes Manou's off stump, that is almost the perfect ball. Anderson to Siddle, OUT fantastic delivery, swinging in, then straightening a touch on the right-hander who tries to work it through midwicket but gets a thick outside edge for Anderson's five Onions to Hauritz, 1 wide oh dear. Miles wide of the off stump - Onions saw Hauritz move Onions to Hilfenhaus, OUT got him! Another slapping drive finds Swann in the gully, and that's the final wicket for Onions who finishes with four wickets So Australia end on 263. Certainly an underpar total, but England's openers will need to be alert: Hilfenhaus and Co. swing it too. Anderson leads off his troops after finishing with five wickets. Righto, so join Brydon in about ten minutes for the 6.25pm - stumps So, that's it for the second day's play - an enthralling day it was. Don't forget to check out the video highlights (plenty to watch tonight) along with the bulletin if you've missed any of the play. And most importantly of all, mos 10.45am The umpires are out in the middle and having a look. It's dark and not ideal conditions, though it's not actually raining. More of a drizzle, and it doesn't really know whether to stop or whether to give it absolutely everything. Frustratin 11.00am No chance of any play before lunch, we reckon. It's seriously moist and damp out there. There'll be another pitch inspection at midday, and we'll keep you up to speed then. 12.00pm Right, pitch inspection is currently underway, but the two umpires don't look too enthusiastic and it's drizzling persistently. Meanwhile, doesn't Aleem Dar have a stupendous mullet atop his nugget? It looks like it's made out of wax. Outst Perusing what cricket books are coming up for sale. Always interesting to see who's publishing what. Don't forget out reviews section in the Magazine. Siddle to Bell, 5 wide oh dear, that's a shame for Siddle. A loose leg-side stray - just didn't come out right and flew miles wide of both batsman and keeper Hilfenhaus to Strauss, OUT Gone! Hilfenhaus makes the breakthrough, Strauss goes at last. Short of a length outside off and he gets a thick top edge attempting to cut, straightforward take for Manou. Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, OUT Hilfenhaus gets another! Well bowled, a fullish outswinger and Collingwood drives, the thick edge is well taken by Ponting above his head at second slip Johnson to Prior, 2 byes the first real stray from Johnson, and the crowd love it. Wings it wide of the leg stump. Manou doesn't have a hope. What a winner Siddle to Flintoff, 1 leg bye a leg-bye is taken. Flintoff limps through - could have had two, but he's nowhere near fit enough Siddle to Prior, OUT oops, mistimes this one and that's the end of Prior. Short ball, pulled and comes off the bottom of the bat, lobbing up to mid-on where the 12th man Phil Hughes takes the catch Hauritz to Flintoff, SIX runs oooh, Flintoff uses the feet here and lofts Hauritz clean over long-on, lovely shot, after some third-umpire assistance that is ruled a six having hit the boundary on the full Hauritz to Flintoff, OUT well, well. That's a very odd dismissal, it spins out of the rough and Flintoff plays no shot, but doesn't get his gloves out of the way, and the catch is taken at first slip Johnson to Swann, 1 wide short ball, not surprising with the short leg in place, but it's just a bit too far over the head Johnson to Swann, (no ball) wayhay! A no-ball bouncer, Swann sways out of the way Incidentally, there are 10,000 tickets available for tomorrow's fifth and final day. ?25 for adults, ?10 for under-16s. An absolute steal. Edgbaston.com is where to go. Match drawn Player of the match is Michael Clarke, AUS","Australia 263 (Watson 62, Anderson 5-80, Onions 4-58) and 375 for 5 (Watson 53, Hussey 64, Clarke 103*, North 96) drew with England 376 (Strauss 69, Bell 53, Flintoff 74, Broad 55, Hilfenhaus 4-109) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Michael Clarke continued his fine form with another important second-innings century Getty Images After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, in which England's push for victory fell as flat as the fifth day pitch, the question now stands: who takes the momentum into Headingley? The temptation is to give the nod to England given their 1-0 series advantage and flashes of brilliance between the spells of drizzle in Birmingham. But, on closer inspection, the matter may not be so clear-cut. Australia will take tremendous confidence from their second-innings batting performance, in which three batsmen passed 50 and one, Michael Clarke, a stoic century in his 50th Test to limit England to just five wickets from 112 overs. Shane Watson's returns of 62 and 53 in his first Test as opener will prove particularly encouraging as will the final-day efforts of Michael Hussey (64) and Marcus North (96), both of whom were in need of a confidence boost. The Australians will also be buoyed at the possibility that Mitchell Johnson's nightmare might just have been confined to the month of July."
"Behrendorff to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye appeal for lbw but not given. Full on off, and angling inwards. Tries to whip it off his legs, but the ball hits his back leg. Rolls away to square leg Jhye Richardson to Rahul, SIX runs full and wide outside off, and lifted into the stands! Width offered, and Rahul prods forward before confidently driving over the infield. Someone in the crowd makes a mess of the catch too Cummins to Rahul, SIX runs what a shot! Full on middle, right near his toes, and he nonchalantly flicks this over deep midwicket! All the work done by Rahul's bottom-hand. Proper whippage Coulter-Nile to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye offcutter, full outside leg stump. Dhawan tries to whip this behind square, but ball hits his front leg. No appeal for lbw, since the ball didn't pitch on the stumps. Ball rolls away to the leg side as the batsmen pinch a single Short to Pant, OUT gone, the pressure's told on Pant! Tosses this one up enticingly, a fair way outside off stump, and Pant goes for the big heave and loses his shape. Wasn't quite full enough for him to control perfectly, and it turns and skews up in the air for Jhye Richardson to take an outstanding catch, sprinting to his left from long-off and throwing himself horizontally at the ball Short to Dhoni, SIX runs another delivery along a similar trajectory, flighted and inviting Dhoni to go for another slog-sweep. Dhoni watches it better this time, and the ball soars way over the midwicket boundary Coulter-Nile to Kohli, SIX runs and yet, he can hit shots like this. Another slower ball, on a length and finishing on about off stump. Kohli just brings his wrists into play and flicks it all the way over the midwicket boundary Coulter-Nile to Kohli, SIX runs That's a Mahendra Singh Kohli shot alright! A couple of steps down the pitch to the off-stump length ball, and he brings his wrists into play once more to whip it high over the forward square leg boundary Jhye Richardson to Kohli, SIX runs bam. Doesn't get his attempted wide yorker wide enough or full enough, and Kohli takes a step across his stumps to get a little closer and swing through the line to clear the long-off boundary comfortably Cummins to Dhoni, OUT miscued, and Dhoni won't get his fifty. Cummins bowls a cross-seam ball, just short of a good length, on about off stump, and Dhoni, aiming towards long-on, slices it instead and long-off takes a simple catch walking a few steps forward off the rope Cummins to Kohli, SIX runs down the track, Cummins tries to bowl a slower ball out of his reach, well outside off, but doesn't quite succeed. He only allows Kohli to free his arms, and he does so gleefully to launch a crisp hit over the long-off boundary 8.46pm Hello, and welcome back to the second innings. Still a few minutes to go before the second innings gets underway. Make no mistake, this is barely an above-par total at the Chinnaswamy, but the wicket was double-paced for the first ten overs. Shankar to bowl Chahal to Short, 1 wide nice idea, but the execution goes slightly wrong. The quicker slider, angled away from Short and forcing him to reach out to drive. Just ends up angling it too wide Chahal to Maxwell, 1 wide looks to bowl that wide line he's bowled with success to Maxwell, but ends up bowling it too wide. Left alone Shankar to Maxwell, 1 wide slower ball gone wrong, ends up whanging it waaay outside off stump Shankar to Maxwell, SIX runs wham. He's bowled a lot of slower balls, and Maxwell was well prepared. Back of a length, on off stump, and he's back and across in a flash and has all the time in the world to swat this away over the midwicket boundary. That makes it 13 off this over, and 38 off Shankar's four. I guess India will take it, especially since he got the wicket of Short. Kaul to Maxwell, (no ball) SIX runs waist-high full-toss. We'll have to check for no-ball here. Yup, it is, but it doesn't matter to Maxwell, who opens up at the hips and simply wallops this over wide long-on. Sensational hitting, moves to 98 10.45pm And that is that from this T20I series. Come World Cup, you'd think Australia will have assembled a pretty damn formidable 15, regardless of their poor results in the format over the last couple of years. There's still an ODI series to go before that, and it begins on March 2 in Hyderabad. Be sure to join us for that. Until then, it's goodbye from Sreshth, Chandan and me. Good night! Australia won by 7 wickets (with 2 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn Maxwell, AUS","Australia 194 for 3 (Maxwell 113*, Short 40, Shankar 2-38) beat India 190 for 4 (Kohli 72*, Rahul 47, Dhoni 40) by seven wickets Glenn Maxwell was ""disappointed"" at not staying unbeaten during Australia's victory in the first T20I, and he made sure not to repeat that in the second. Coming in at 22 for two, Maxwell struck his third T20I century to chase down 191 in Bengaluru, and hand Australia their first bilateral T20I series win against the hosts. Chasing a target slightly above-par on a tricky pitch, Maxwell struck seven fours and nine sixes to top-score for Australia in back-to-back games. His unbeaten 55-ball 113 helped Australia cruise to victory with seven wickets in hand. That Maxwell had the liberty to play his shots was also down to the company that D'Arcy Short (40) gave him."
"Siddle to Pietersen, OUT got him! Terrific ball that moved away just a touch from Pietersen, drawn forward into a drive, and it took a thin outside edge to a diving Haddin behind the stumps Johnson to PD Collingwood, 1 leg bye on his pads, Collingwood tucks it for a single to bring up England's 300. It's a start. A good start, but only a start. Clarke to PD Collingwood, OUT got him! Strauss is fuming with Collingwood here, as he skips down the pitch and miscues it - a horrible welly - straight to mid-on Johnson to Prior, OUT what a cracker! Johnson has got one to swing back in to the right-hander Prior and it's through the gate, takes off stump. Australia are well and truly back in this! Hilfenhaus to Flintoff, OUT gone! The old ball works out for Hilfenhaus. A great outswinger takes the edge of Flintoff's bat and Ponting and second slip snaffles the opportunity Hilfenhaus to Strauss, OUT GOT HIM! Strauss leaves one which bends back - a disastrous leave from the England captain and his off stump is pegged back. What a start for Australia! Siddle to Broad, (no ball) nicely stroked out to mid-off - full enough to do so Siddle to Swann, OUT edged to Ponting at second slip! Brilliant from Siddle, pitching it short and angling it up the hill and at chest height to Swann who angles it straight to slip Hilfenhaus to Broad, OUT bowled him! Three in fifteen minutes for Australia as Broad again attempts a loose drive outside off and drags it on Johnson to Anderson, OUT got him this time! Got big on him and square cut it low to gully who took a fine catch Anderson to Ponting, OUT big appeal, and what's happened here? It was a dual lbw/caught appeal and Ponting is out caught at first slip! Angled in, there must've been an inside edge onto the pad and after Koertzen checks if the ball carried, he g Onions to Katich, OUT this is up in the air at fine leg - what a catch! A stunner from Broad. On the pull, he top-edged it and Broad ran 10 or 12 yards to his right before diving, taking it low. Brilliant Anderson to North, 4 byes wide of the off stump and it shoots through a little low on Prior, though he really should've stopped that Onions to Hauritz, OUT got him! Short of a length outside off, Hauritz goes back and tries to force it off the back foot but can only edge to Collingwood who holds a safe catch at third slip So, yes, they're going to have another bat. No great surprise really. Here's Brydon until lunch. Innings Start Lots of oohs and aahs from the slips","England 425 and 311 for 6 dec (Prior 61, Collingwood 54) beat Australia 215 and 406 (Clarke 136, Haddin 80, Johnson 63, Flintoff 5-92, Swann 4-87) by 115 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Andrew Flintoff strikes a pose after dismissing Brad Haddin on his way to a five-wicket haul on his final Test appearance at Lord's Getty Images In his final act at the home of cricket, Andrew Flintoff broke England's 75-year Lord's curse with his first five-wicket haul since the Ashes-clinching Oval Test of 2005. It was, unquestionably, a performance that will enhance his already mythical status within English cricket, but more pertinently for now, delivered England to a 1-0 series lead heading into Edgbaston. Victory was sealed 17 minutes before lunch when Graeme Swann, another major contributor on Monday, pegged back Mitchell Johnson's middle stump with the Australian total at 406. The wicket prompted scenes of jubilation not witnessed at Lord's in decades, and a collective furrowing of brows in the Australian dressing rooms as the series momentum shifted sharply in the hosts' favour. Flintoff, who bowled unchanged for ten overs from the Pavilion End to claim three of the five Australian wickets to fall on Monday, broke first from England's celebratory huddle to shake the hands of the vanquished Johnson and his batting partner, Ben Hilfenhaus."
"Siddle to Pietersen, 1 bye oh dear - a big inswinger down the leg side and Haddin palms it to fine-leg Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, OUT got him - what a catch by Haddin diving to his right! Just outside the off stump, Collingwood edged it and Haddin moved a little late, but clung on with both hands Hauritz to Pietersen, OUT got him! A terrible shot from Pietersen, trying to sweep this from miles outside off without getting down into position, and he top edges it meekly straight into the hands of a delighted Katich at short-leg Siddle to Flintoff, OUT bowled him! An horrid, angled bat as he tries to drive but gets a thick inside edge which hammers into his stumps Siddle to Prior, OUT inswing back into the right-hander and he's bowled him! A fantastic delivery by Siddle - huge, late inswing and it forces its way through Prior's gate Johnson to Broad, OUT bowled him! Johnson gets one on target at last and bowls Broad off his pads and around his legs Hauritz to Anderson, OUT down the pitch and he tries to lift him over mid-on but he can't - an easy catch for Hussey who jumps back and swallows it Hilfenhaus to Swann, 1 leg bye worked off his pads for a single Hauritz to Panesar, OUT that's the end of the innings, Hauritz gets his third with a ball that drifts in and Panesar gets a thick edge to second slip Broad to Haddin, 1 wide short on off stump, Haddin thinks about hooking and then pulls the bat out of the way at the last moment Broad to Haddin, 1 wide another bouncer, it's well over Haddin's head and Billy Doctrove calls it a wide Flintoff to Haddin, 1 bye starts with a stiff shocker down the leg side. Prior does well to dive to his left Panesar to Haddin, SIX runs superb shot. Down the pitch and smashing it over the top. Damien Martyn couldn't have played it better Swann to North, 1 leg bye goes for a reverse sweep, rapped on the pads but outside the line. And hit on the glove. PD Collingwood to Haddin, OUT and finally, something for the England fans to cheer. Haddin goes over the top again, trying for a six out to midwicket and Bopara takes the catch. And with that comes the declaration. So Australia have played magnificently to build a lead of 239. North and Haddin were wonderful today. Now it's on England's top order to make the pitch look as placid as their Australian counterparts. Haddin Match drawn Player of the match is Ricky Ponting, AUS","England 435 (Pietersen 69, Collingwood 64, Prior 56) and 252 for 9 (Collingwood 74, Hilfenhaus 3-37) drew with Australia 674 for 6 dec (Ponting 150, Katich 122, North 125*, Haddin 121, Clarke 81) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details James Anderson and Monty Panesar steal a single to guide England to safety at Cardiff AFP James Anderson and Monty Panesar produced the most important innings of their lives as England's final pair survived 11.3 overs to pull off a thrilling escape at Cardiff. When Paul Collingwood fell for a monumental 245-ball 74 England still trailed by six, but once Australia had to bat again, valuable time was taken out of the game leaving Andrew Strauss and a packed Cardiff nervously clock-watching. The Australians threw everything into the final hour in an electric atmosphere with the crowd cheering the two unlikely batting heroes as though the Ashes had been won. A vital moment came when Anderson collected consecutive boundaries off Peter Siddle to finally erase the deficit."

After North sped the Australians to 438 for 4 at the lunch-time declaration in Worcester, the tourists were pleased to see Johnson remove both openers and Lee gain reverse-swing in the 33rd over before the match was called off almost an hour early. The end was signalled shortly after the umpire Jeff Evans collapsed on the side of the pitch with the England Lions 162 for 4. Johnson was more fluent as he built on a rusty performance in the first innings during a nine-over spell that set him up for Cardiff. He enters the Ashes as Australia's major weapon and the only thing missing is the sharp movement that turned him into a dominator during the series in South Africa."

It's a really busy day for all of us here but don't worry, we're not going to pile it on you guys. The toss is about 10 minutes away. Yuvraj to Watson, OUT sharp work by Dhoni!

Gambhir was just flummoxed, Hauritz lands it on a good length on middle, the ball grips, turns and beats the gap between pad and bat and clips the off stump, Gambhir looked quite lost at the crease and barely attempted Bollinger to Dhoni, 1 bye starts with a ball well outside off, Dhoni  Siddle to Yuvraj, 1 wide down the leg side, Yuvraj looks to tickle it past the keeper but misses Siddle to Yuvraj, 1 bye full and wide, Yuvraj looks to steer it past the keeper but misses, the ball takes off after passing the wicket making it difficult for the keeper to catch Henriques to Yuvraj, SIX runs wow, sensational timing from Yuvraj, almost no power behind that flick which sends the ball sailing over the long-on boundary Voges to Yuvraj, SIX runs short ball, Yuvraj says thank you and bludgeons it over the long-on boundary Henriques to Yuvraj, OUT lbw! Henriques came round the wicket and angled a good length ball into the left-hander, Yuvraj stayed in his crease, missed it and got hit on the back pad, was that going down leg? Umpire Saheba didn't think so. Yuvraj's played a ""On this wicket, I think everybody bowled well. I'm really happy. If there was no dew 220-230 could have been difficult to chase. The pitch was looking really ugly. All in all, it was a great team effort.""

Australia would perhaps rue the fact that they settled for 229 when they batted after winning an important toss. ""A total of 220 should be a good score on this pitch,"" Ponting had said and Australia's approach while batting reflected his mindset. Their bowlers did pick up three quick top-order wickets to leave India wobbling at 53 for 3 but Yuvraj and Dhoni batted with the knowledge that sufficient time spent at the crease would ensure a risk-free victory. The pitch was slow and not conducive to stroke making but it did not spin treacherously, despite the visibly dramatic wear and tear."
"Toss: Australia won the toss and have chosen to bowl. Siddle to Tendulkar, OUT Siddle takes out SRT. Full in length, outside off, luring Tendulkar across but it straightens to take the edge. Full length delivery after the bouncer does the trick. Tendulkar played away from the body there, much like in the first game. What a lovely start from Siddle. Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, 1 wide high bouncer on the leg and middle line, climbs over Sehwag who ducks Johnson to Sehwag, OUT What a soft dismissal! It was a full length delivery around the off stump line, Sehwag went for the big airy drive but mistimed it completely and sends a dolly of a catch to mid-off. It was outside off and Sehwag ended up slicing his drive Johnson to Yuvraj, 1 wide again going down leg side, Yuvraj fails to connect with the flick and Paine gathers Hauritz to Yuvraj, SIX runs Yuvraj goes down town. He skipped down the track and lifted it cleanly over long-off. Interestingly. Ponting had just brought the long-off in for this ball and Yuvraj has taken up the challenge. Hilfenhaus to Yuvraj, OUT Done in by the slightly slower one. It was full, it was straight and Yuvraj couldn't keep his drive down. Hilfy swoops to pick up a sharp catch on his follow through. Australia tighten the screws. Hilfenhaus to Dhoni, 1 leg bye Ouch! It crashes against the helmet. Clatter. It was the bouncer, Dhoni just didn't pick it up and just yanked his head away. The ball hit the helmet on the back. He had just turned his face behind and the ball crashed against the bottom of the helmet. Had it gone few inches down, it would have go Voges to Gambhir, 1 wide spins down the leg side .. wide Johnson to Gambhir, 2 leg byes goes for the yorker, ends up as a low dipping full toss on the legs, rolls away to fine-leg. He was out to a similar ball in the first game Watson to Gambhir, 1 leg bye short of a good length delivery, on the middle and off stump line - Gambhir tries to work it away on the leg side but fails to make contact and the ball rolls away off the pad. Dhoni calls early and once again they scamper through for a well judged single Johnson to Raina, 2 wide wayward delivery down the leg side and Paine does well to make a diving half-stop Johnson to Dhoni, 1 wide from round the stumps but slips in a wide delivery outside off stump. Raina walks across to punch Dhoni's gloves Johnson to Dhoni, OUT Dhoni falls after a superbly paced knock. It was a full delivery on the off stump line, he tried to whip it across the line but edged it to right of Paine who takes a tumbling catch. Dhoni gets a standing ovation from the crowd. He started off ,dealing in singles, before he turned violent in the end Johnson to Raina, OUT Another sharp catch from Paine. Raina edged the intended lofted hit to long-on and the ball appeared to be flying over Paine who leaped to bring it back to earth. What a gem of a cameo from Raina, though. Bosh. Biff. Wham bham stuff from him. Praveen to Ponting, 1 wide goes for the slower one but slips down the leg side Sharma to Watson, OUT Ishant strikes first ball. It kicked up high from short of length, Watson was pressing forward before he tried go back and dab it to third man. However, he was done in by the extra bounce. At the last minute, he tried to adjust by taking out the bottom hand off the handle but only succeeded in guiding the bal Praveen to Ponting, OUT trapped right in front. PK has taken out the big wicket of the Australian captain and the crowd roar their approval. It was a length delivery that cut in from just outside off. Ponting was on the front foot, looking to drive on the up but is beaten by the inward movement. He was struck in line on the off a Yuvraj to Hussey, 1 leg bye on the leg stump line, slower through the air, Hussey is through with the flick a touch early and is struck on the pad Harbhajan to White, OUT White has been repeatedly trying to get down the track but has been unable to reach the pitch of the ball. And he has adjusted by jabbing it away,. But this time, he tries to go through with the shot and only succeeds in lobbing a dolly to Raina at straight ish midwicket. Harbhajan to Hussey, 1 wide on the leg stump line, goes for the sweep but misses Jadeja to Hussey, OUT He took out Ponting with a good delivery in the last game Harbhajan to Marsh, 1 leg bye on the pads, tries to sweep and collects a leg bye Harbhajan to Johnson, 1 wide down the leg side and Sahiba extends his arms Sharma to Hauritz, 1 wide banged in short and well outside off, cut and a miss ..

Then, in tandem with Suresh Raina, he ripped the bowling to shreds. MS Dhoni's superb 107-ball 124 was the foundation for India's highest-ever total against Australia, a mammoth 354 for 7, and once Praveen Kumar and Ishant Sharma winkled out Australia's top three for just 45, the match was effectively over. Michael Hussey's 53 provided a lone note of defiance as India romped home by 99 runs, to leave the series all square as the teams packed their bags and headed to Delhi. The match slipped out of Australia's grasp in the final 11 overs of the Indian innings."
"Jadeja to Ponting, OUT Plumb in front. Ponting doesn't look happy. It landed on a length on the middle and leg, turned in past the defensive push and hit him on the back pad right in front of middle stump. Dead plumb. Fine innings comes to an end. Nehra to White, OUT White falls after taking the batting powerplay. It was the full delivery outside off, White tried to fetch it from there with a big slog but ended up slicing it high to extra cover where Raina waits patiently for the ball to dip into Harbhajan to Voges, OUT tossed up on the off stump line, spins in, Vogues goes for the slog sweep but gets more elevation than distance and is caught in the deep Sharma to Hussey, OUT Hussey falls after a wonderful knock. Hilditch must be watching closely. He dragged the ball from outside off and heaved it to deep midwicket Sharma to Lee, OUT full delivery, lee tries to squeeze it out to the on side, misses it and it deflects off the back pad on to the stumps Lee to Sehwag, 1 leg bye cuts in from the off stump line, rolls off the pad to the off side and Tendulkar calls him over for a single Siddle to Sehwag, 5 wide pushes it wide down the leg side and Tim Paine can't quite get behind it and the ball bursts through the gloves Watson to Tendulkar, OUT Ricky Ponting takes a neat catch at short extra cover. Tendulkar drove on the up to left of Ponting who flung himself to take a sharp catch. Two down and wobbling. Australia move into the driver's seat. Hopes to Kohli, 1 leg bye loud shout for lbw. It landed on a length on the off and cut in sharply and struck Kohli in front of the leg. The umpire reckoned it would have missed leg  Hauritz to Kohli, 1 leg bye flighted outside off stump, Kohli tries to work it to the on side and is struck just outside off stump Voges to Kohli, OUT Virat is once again caught at long-off. We have seen that quite often in the IPL and Champions League games as well. He charged down the track but was beaten in flight, tried to go though with the shot and skied it up. Watson ran in Johnson to Gambhir, OUT caught right in front by the low dipping full toss. It was dipping in front of leg and middle stump and Gambhir stumbled a bit while trying to get forward and flick it. He missed and was struck dead plumb. Johnson to Raina, OUT Done in by the slower one. Raina was completely fooled Johnson to Jadeja, 2 wide low full toss well down the leg side and Paine makes a tumbling half-stop Watson to Dhoni, OUT And Australia on the ascendancy here. Dhoni charged out for the big shot but mistimed it straight to mid-on. Lee throws the ball up in the air and Dhoni crashes his bat onto the ground. Joy and sorrow collide. Johnson to Jadeja, 1 wide slips down the leg side and it will be a wide Hauritz to Jadeja, OUT he survived a close shout couple of balls earlier but not now. It landed on a length on the middle and off line, Jadeja went for the sweep, missed and was struck in front. It would have hit the off stump. And then they were three. Watson to Harbhajan, 1 leg bye another slower one, Harbhajan is early in to the swing across the line and collects a leg bye Hauritz to Harbhajan, SIX runs Massive! He took couple of steps down the track and heaves the delivery from well outside off to wide long-on boundary. The crowd find their voice again and the ball is lost. New balls please. Siddle to Harbhajan, SIX runs What a stunner! It was the waist-high full toss, from round the stumps, and Harbhajan just swatted it away over fine-leg boundary Siddle to Harbhajan, OUT Clatter! The off stump has been pegged back. Siddle roars and the crowd applaud the departing Harbhajan. He opened up his stance and tried to swing the length delivery across the line but missed. Timber! Enter Ashish Nehra. what Both teams shake hands and they wait for the post-match ceremony. Hang on for a short while, we would bring you the breathless quotes from that. Hopefully, we would know why Brett Lee wasn't used in the end. Was he injured? He was there on the field, though.

Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey set up what looked like being a comfortable Australian win until a lively, crowd-lifting partnership from Harbhajan Singh and Praveen Kumar threatened to snatch victory for India. In the end, nine were required from the final over and Peter Siddle held his nerve to confirm a four-run margin in Australia's favour. The key moment came when Harbhajan (49) was bowled from the second ball of the 50th, trying to launch a boundary off Siddle. Six from the last ball was too much for Ashish Nehra to produce."

Hawkeye That wicket brings about a declaration from the Australian captain. It's come a little bit earlier than one might have expected, despite the obvious attacking attitude from the batsmen since lunch. Shane Watson to bowl now.

Nathan Hauritz, placed on notice by Australia's selectors prior to the series, claimed his first career five-wicket haul as Pakistan crumbled from 3 for 170 overnight to be all out for 251 shortly after lunch on the final day. Hauritz's ability to exploit wearing pitches had been called into question of late, not least by Andrew Hilditch, and he proved himself worthy of the challenge on Wednesday. Unable to replicate the biting turn that accounted for Faisal Iqbal the previous day, Hauritz instead utilised flight and bounce to challenge Pakistan's lower and middle orders and was rewarded with four final-day scalps. Australia began the day in emphatic fashion with Mitchell Johnson removing Umar Akmal and Misbah-ul-Haq with consecutive deliveries in his first over."
"Australia have won the toss and opted to bowl. Handscomb to not only debut but also keep wickets. Behrendorff to Rohit Sharma, OUT the short fine-leg shows great anticipation and takes a simple catch in the end!. Rohit goes for a premeditated scoop, it doesn't quite come onto the bat, he doesn't get all of it and ends up spooning it to short fine-leg, who was ready for it before the shot was even completed Zampa to Kohli, OUT down the track, gets to the pitch but flicks it aerially straight down long-on's throat. Zampa got a hint of drift which perhaps resulted in Kohli dragging the ball to the leg side when he may have preferred going straight over the bowler's head Zampa to Rahul, SIX runs down the wicket and Rahul goes through the line, over the bowler's head for a maximum. He got the length and it was also the straighter one Coulter-Nile to Rahul, OUT Rahul backs away to go through the off side but the bowler does well to follow him, cramping him for the room he was trying to make and he only gets it off the bottom of the bat to spoon a simple catch to mid-off Coulter-Nile to Karthik, OUT Coulter-Nile barges through the defences of Karthik. He dares to shimmy down the pitch, Coulter-Nile hits a hard length and gets it to move back in slightly. Karthik, having left his crease, misses it altogether and is bowled through the gate. Jhye Richardson to Yadav, 1 leg bye short and slanted in, Umesh plays around his front pad and misses the leg-side flick. Off the pad and the ball rolls to square leg Cummins to Yadav, 1 wide length, angled in, Umesh shuffles across, misses the leg glance and it's called wide Cummins to Yadav, OUT shuffles across and this was waiting to happen.

Long tails can do strange things. Those two ingredients combined in Visakhapatnam to produce an intriguing low-scoring thriller, and in the end it was Australia who shaded a tight contest between two imperfect teams. It came down to the last ball, with two runs needed, and Pat Cummins, who had just slapped the previous delivery, a wide full-toss, to the cover boundary, kept his head to complete the job. Umesh Yadav sent down a good ball, in the blockhole, and Cummins nudged it down the ground towards long-on, knowing the fielder was too deep to sprint in off the boundary and cut off the second run."

Roach and Gavin Tonge had added 15 when Doug Bollinger and the Australians were certain Roach had got an edge to Brad Haddin.

It was India of the 90s all over again: Tendulkar almost chased 351 on his own but, with the target in sight, he got out and the rest choked, falling short by three runs with two balls still to go. In Chennai in 1998-99, Tendulkar, having played an innings as incredible as this, left the last three wickets 17 to get; tonight he left them 19 off 17. With Praveen Kumar hitting a six over long-off and then taking sensible singles, it seemed things would finally change for Tendulkar. With five required off the last three, Praveen - batting with No."

He pitched it on a good length outside off and angled it into the right-hander, RP drove away from his body and the thick outside edge flew towards Gilchrist who took a comfortable catch Lee to Sharma, OUT Lee gets his fifth!

However, Australia won the vital moments during the chase to level the series in Mohali. Like in Vadodara, Harbhajan Singh and Praveen Kumar threatened to pull off a heist; like in Vadodara they failed. It was a roller-coaster of a chase and whenever India appeared to be getting ahead, Australia fought back with a vengeance.

The good news for Australia is that their batsmen will get to practice chasing now, they've got something of a target to try to hunt down. Join us Malinga to Hopes, 1 wide bangs it in really short and that sails over Hopes' hunched back, wide called Murali to Hopes, 1 wide starts down leg with a wide Murali to Gilchrist, SIX runs comes out again and drives up and over straight, he doesn't even bother to take one step this time as he knows that's going to go to the boundary. Replays show that it was a six, so it must have hit the rope on the full Murali to Hopes, OUT ah, what's gone on here, the ball past him and nudges the off stump and the bail comes off, it takes a while to realise he's actually bowled, as it could also have been a stumping by Sangakkara and Hopes had moved in front of the stumps so you c Kulasekara to Gilchrist, OUT fabulous catch by Malinga! Gilchrist goes for the aerial drive once more, booming the ball up to long-off where Malinga charges round and takes the ball in front of him on the slide, great catch to end a great innings MKDI Amerasinghe to Haddin, 1 wide swing down leg and that's given wide, correctly Malinga to Haddin, OUT cracking yorker right up there on middle and the umpire needed only a fraction of a second to put up the finger. Haddin was completely beaten with the change of pace there, stabbing down on the ball Malinga to Bracken, 1 wide wide down leg this time, no question there Jayasuriya to Lee, OUT another inspired decision by Jayawardene! Jayasuriya strikes with his first delivery of the match at a crucial time, the batsman trying to pull across the line and he got an inside edge back on to leg stump and all the stumps wobble Jayasuriya loves that, clenching his fist and if that's his last contribution in a game on Australian soil, as it is likely to be, well, that was a fitting ending.

Getty Images Adam Gilchrist provided the fireworks but Sri Lanka's seamers had the extinguisher at the MCG, where Australia's blistering start of 0 for 107 in the 15th over somehow turned into their first loss in nearly three weeks. Chasing 222 Australia were cruising as Gilchrist belted 83 from 50 balls, but a collapse of 6 for 16 in ten overs ensured Sri Lanka regained some pride with a 13-run win. It almost turned back Australia's way as Nathan Bracken and Brett Lee combined for a 35-run tenth-wicket stand that brought them within sight of victory, but Sanath Jayasuriya had one final trick in his last match on Australian soil. With 14 needed from two overs, Jayasuriya, who had not been handed the ball until then, came on and bowled Lee (37) first ball to seal the win. The result did not mean anything - Sri Lanka are still flying home on Saturday and Australia are safely in the finals - but it did highlight why some fans will miss the tri-series, despite its tired format."

Getty Images A spirited chase led by Gautam Gambhir and Robin Uthappa fell 18 short as Australia celebrated the end of Ricky Ponting's rocky batting patch with a tight victory. While the home side toasted a return to form ahead of Sunday's first final, India's plight to reach the CB Series deciders now comes down to the match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday after they reached 299, a haul relying on Gambhir's second century of the tournament. A horrible series was forgotten by Ponting during his fine 124 while half-centuries to Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds also lifted their clouds of poor form in a brutal team display of 7 for 317. In the face of such a challenge - it was easily the highest total of the series - India were always behind and it was only the performances of Gambhir and Robin Uthappa that kept them in the game after the first four wickets went by the 11th over. Gambhir and Mahendra Singh Dhoni met at the difficulty of 4 for 51 and made sure the team could provide some outstanding fight during the 98-run liaison, but the assignment eventually proved too difficult."
"1.20pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and sent Australia in. An interesting decision to chase under the lights. Vaas to Gilchrist, OUT Gilchrist advances down the track to meet one which pitched on middle and went on to hit leg as his vain would-be aerial swish towards midwicket got nowhere near the ball Maharoof to Hayden, OUT slower ball deceives Hayden, pushed across him and the batsman was looking to work the ball to leg from outside off, instead popping up to cover where Silva takes a good catch, leaving the ground to take it over his head Maharoof to Ponting, OUT great fielding there, a mix-up between the batsmen as Ponting pushes forward and wants the single. Maharoof dives out to his right to stop the ball and as it dribbles away from him he recovers and flings hard to Sangakkara who does the honours Maharoof to Symonds, OUT a huge call from Sangakkara as he believes Symonds inside-edged just a feather through to him and indeed he has, his feet trapped in the crease as he fended away from his body to the ball which came outside off on a good length MKDI Amerasinghe to Hussey, 1 wide a very wide down off, looks like he just slipped, Malinga went to give him an encouraging pat Murali to Clarke, OUT low full toss and Clarke's eyes light up as he drives hard at Murali whose upturned hands pushed it up and then he collects at the second time Malinga to Hussey, 1 bye outside off, Hussey can't get on to it and Sangakkara gets the end of a glove on it, the batsmen cheeking through a single Murali to Hopes, OUT on off, pushed a quicker ball past him, Hopes was bamboozled going for the sweep and then wandered out of his crease, possibly looking for the bye, meanwhile Sangakkara almost apologetically, though he gives no inch, took the bails off Malinga to Hogg, OUT outside off, and that's the catch of the day, cut hard to point and it was travelling low, Dilshan snaps it up sharply around his ankles on the kneel Clark to Perera, OUT and he gets another, pitching on the stumps and trapping Perera, not getting far forward as he goes for a flick, in front of about leg stump ...

Getty Images Australia secured their place in the CB Series finals with their win over Sri Lanka but the match was another one Ricky Ponting will want to wipe from his personal highlights reel. Ponting managed 11 from 34 balls to take his tournament tally to 64 at 10.66 and he even found a new way to sabotage himself, run out when he tried to take a single after hitting the ball back to the bowler. ""When you're in a bit of a rut like I am you tend to find ways of getting out,"" Ponting said. ""I was just trying to get myself in and get used to the pace of the wicket today."
"Australia have been pretty strong in their last two ODIs, following West Indies' win in the Twenty20 which seems a while ago. So it's a must-win situation for the home side, stay with us for the toss news soon. Lee to Marshall, 1 wide down the legs, and Lee just strays too far with the effort, Marshall is quick to jump into an extravagant leave Bracken to Marshall, 1 leg bye some swing back in to the batsman, half-appeal, a bit of ball-watching going on but Gayle calls the quick single to the covers Bracken to Gayle, SIX runs Meaty blow as Gayle goes down town. He walked down the track and scythed a full length delivery over long-off. He just stood there and admired the stroke. Now a long-off is in place Johnson to Gayle, 1 wide down the leg side and Ronchi makes a diving stop Symonds to Chanderpaul, OUT Ronchi snaps another good catch. Chanderpaul edged the intended cut shot and Ronchi managed to take it on the second attempt. Lee to Sammy, OUT Wicket no 300 for Lee. It was the slower one and Sammy was early into the intended lofted shot, edged it towards short mid-off region, Lee called for it early and pouches it safely. Bracken to Ramdin, OUT he moved outside leg, tried to cut a short of length delivery but it was the slower one and he ended up chopping it on to his stumps.

Getty Images Shane Watson made his first ODI century and Ricky Ponting bounced back to form as Australia completed yet another one-sided victory over West Indies to take an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Chasing 224 on a decent batting pitch, Australia ruthlessly took advantage of a lacklustre bowling effort from West Indies to cruise to one of their easiest wins in recent memory, reaching the target with seven wickets in hand and 57 balls to spare. Watson is competing with Shaun Marsh to become the permanent limited-overs opening partner for Matthew Hayden and his 126 will do his cause significant good. He fell late in the chase, paddle-sweeping to short fine-leg, but Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke had no trouble getting Australia over the line. As well as Watson played, he will rarely enjoy an innings at international level where he is under less pressure."
"9:30am Australia have won the toss and they will bat. Taylor to Watson, OUT and now there's a wicket, a big one too, to cap what could be the longest first over ever! Taylor pitches very full and angles the ball in through the air, Watson expects it to move away and doesn't get his front foot out too much but the ball dips and clips him flush on the foot Powell to Marsh, OUT edged and taken! Powell bowls it short of a length and Marsh, trying to steer it down to third man, doesn't get over the bounce and tickles it to Browne, silly shot that Taylor to Ponting, OUT caught! Slower ball works as Ponting shuffles across and clips this in the air, indifferently, lazily, straight to Gayle at short midwicket, who falls to his right and clutches on Benn to Clarke, OUT and Benn breaks through! He's coming around the wicket, sends in a quicker ball that pitches on off, Clarke is walking across and trying to clip through leg, he's struck in line and that was not spinning, probably taking leg stump 13:30pm Australia lost early wickets, Clarke and Hussey then buckled down on a sluggish track to add exactly 100 in 29 overs. That sounds extremely dull yes, but with an inexperienced order to follow the senior duo opted to bat it out and keep wickets in hand. Both scored sapping half-centuries before West Indies struck back. White finished unbeaten on 40, unable to really smack the Lee to Fletcher, 1 wide that is fast and short, but it's just a fraction too short and well over Fletcher's head, so it's a wide Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 wide strays down leg side this time, that's certainly a wide Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 leg bye he too slogs and scoops into the gap at square leg for one Clarke is the Man of the Match for his half-century and three wickets.

AFP Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke showed West Indies how to apply themselves on a difficult pitch but their hosts ignored the lesson and threw away wickets when the going got tough, handing Australia a comprehensive 63-run Duckworth/Lewis win. When the rain came after 27 overs West Indies' hopes were already dashed and at the resumption they needed a ridiculous 146 more off 14 overs, ensuring Australia took a 2-0 series lead. The victory came because of two men. On a surface that was sluggish and offered tricky seam movement, Hussey and Clarke compiled a restrained and at times soporific century partnership that allowed Australia to reach 213 for 5 after they had wobbled to 35 for 3. West Indies fell to an almost identical 41 for 3 in the chase but whereas Hussey and Clarke went into Test mode and focused on batting out the overs, West Indies' middle order showed as much patience as a hand grenade."

AFP Ricky Ponting has condemned the crowd behaviour in St Vincent that delayed the end of the opening one-day international by ten minutes. West Indies were nine down when Darren Sammy was correctly given out bowled, but the trouble began after Sammy waited near the boundary while the television umpire reviewed the decision. There was no big screen at the stadium and when Sammy, who had 33, left the field the crowd threw bottles and rubbish on to the arena. The dismissal was initially unclear but the replays showed the ball had brushed off stump before bouncing off the wicketkeeper Brad Haddin's pads.

Clark gets into the action, serving up on a length and forcing Sarwan to square-drive on the up when not to the pitch and the failure to keep it down results in a super athletic catch at backward point, Hussey flinging h Johnson to Bravo, OUT and Johnson gets a much-needed wicket! It's a leg-side catch behind, Johnson gave Bravo one on his hips and an attempted glance ran through to Haddin. Mark Benson raises the finger for this one, more confident that it had hit the bat than Johnson to Ramdin, OUT magnificent catch! Johnson angles it across Ramdin, who tries to guide it down between slips and gully. The ball bounced a bit more than Ramdin expected and he battled to keep it down, Clarke at gully dived forward and to his left to sna Clarke to Taylor, OUT full pitch from Clarke, Taylor has clipped it off his toes straight to midwicket, where Katich does not make the same mistake twice in two overs. Easy catch, poor shot, and West Indies' tail is crumbling Johnson to Edwards, 1 leg bye mistimes a short ball off the hips, one-hand, but gets one to square leg 16:21 Thats a Test-best 4 for 41 for Johnson. He's come back very well after a poor morning. Australia have bowled West Indies out for 216 in 58.5 overs, which means they lead by 35.

AFP Beau Casson fought off some harsh treatment from Dwayne Bravo to help Australia grind their way to an 87-run win in Barbados to secure a 2-0 series victory. The visitors' success was not without some tense moments after Bravo and Shivnarine Chanderpaul threatened a record fourth-innings chase, but important breakthroughs to Casson and Stuart Clark exposed West Indies' tail and Australia wrapped up the triumph 20 minutes before tea when Daren Powell flashed a catch behind off Brett Lee. Much like the first Test in Jamaica, Ricky Ponting's blood pressure was rising as West Indies happily pursued a challenging but vaguely gettable target. They started the day needing 240 more runs to make the highest successful Test chase in history, 475, and the explosive 122-run stand between Bravo and Chanderpaul gave them hope. Bravo hammered Casson with the sort of contempt that could have irreparably dented the confidence of the debutant spinner but, to his credit, Casson stayed on task and made the most vital strike of the match."
"Edwards to Marsh, 5 wide well down the leg side and Ramdin can't reach. Blewett, on air, says the 'keeper could have done better than that. Powell to Marsh, OUT Powell and Ramdin combo are at it again. It landed on the leg stump line, on a length and Marsh tried to play it through the on side but the ball cut across him and clipped the outer edge Sammy to Hussey, OUT the slog doesn't work this time. He cleared the front foot and swung a full delivery straight to deep midwicket. Miller to Clarke, OUT another big shout for lbw and Asad Rauf lifts his finger after some delay. Another sweep that Clarke didn't connect but he was struck marginally outside the off stump. In the previous over, he survived a shout when he was hit Bravo to Symonds, 1 wide yorker length delivery but slips down leg Edwards to Symonds, OUT steps down the track, clears the front foot in an effort to the get the bat swing going but Edwards fires it short of length and on the off stump. Symonds tries to flat-bat it over the off side but couldn't clear the fielder Edwards to Hopes, OUT Short delivery, Hopes tries to whip pull it but top edges a dolly to midwicket. Gayle to Hussey, OUT The low full toss does the trick. David skipped down the track and swung a dipping delivery to the substitute fielder at deepmidwicket Gayle to Lee, 1 leg bye short in length, on the middle, tucked to square leg Bravo to Ronchi, OUT full in length, swung straight to long-off. The average first-innings score on this ground is 284 Lee to Marshall, OUT Plumb. Lee didn't even appeal initially as he ran on straight before turning to query Bucknor. Full, fast, tailing into middle and leg and the tentative Xavier is caught on the shuffle. Gone. Bracken to Sarwan, 1 wide swings down leg. Slip and short midwicket in place. It did curve back in. If he gets it to start from off and middle, it could get interesting Lee to Sarwan, 1 wide well outside off stump, Sarwan can't connect with the cut shot. Lee to Gayle, SIX runs Wallop. He cleared the front foot and killed a full delivery over wide long-on. Lee to Sarwan, OUT Lee takes out Sarwan. It kicked up from short of length and came in from outside off, Sarwan wanted to punch it square off the back foot, the bat went outside the line and he feathered a inner edge. Enter Chanders. Lee to Chanderpaul, 1 wide The high bouncer. It sails well above Chanderpaul Lee to Gayle, SIX runs The slow bouncer, Gayle waits before pulling it to deep midwicket boundary. Tragi comedy there. Marsh has his eyes fixed on the ball which sails over him and he trips over the boundary hoardings. Watson to Gayle, 1 wide Perhaps thinking Gayle will go after this ball, pushes it well wide off the off stump Watson to Gayle, OUT Australia break through. Watto strikes. Hopes takes a very good catch. Gayle's fine innings comes to an end. He wanted to swing a full delivery to the leg side but ended up slicing it high in the air towards cover point. It cam Johnson to Chanderpaul, 1 wide wide down the leg side. Ronchi does well to collect that. Johnson is furious with himself. Hopes to Bravo, OUT Clatter. The off cutter, full in length, shaping in towards the middle and off, Bravo plays all around it. Yet another twist. Australia continue to hustle. West Indies fight on. 36 from 42 and this dead-rubber is alive and kicki Lee to Findlay, OUT What a stunner from Michael Hussey at midwicket. The game swings around once more. Findlay tries to force a full length delivery and it flies off the inner half well to the left of Hussey who dives full stretch with his left arm Bracken to Chanderpaul, OUT The death rattle.

AFP Australia snatched a victory that should never have been theirs as Shane Watson delivered a superb final over that consigned West Indies to a devastating one-run defeat. Chris Gayle's 92 had set up what appeared certain to be a successful chase as West Indies pursued 283, but a string of late wickets ensured Michael Clarke tasted success in his first ODI as Australia's captain. Clarke found out just how tough it is juggling bowlers at the end of a tense match as he used up his main men Brett Lee and Nathan Bracken in the 48th and 49th, leaving Watson as the only realistic option to send down the 50th. But crucially the final overs of Bracken and Lee contained a wicket each and when Shivnarine Chanderpaul (53) was bowled trying to turn Bracken through leg it left eight required from six balls. Darren Sammy and Denesh Ramdin could only manage six singles as Watson pitched the ball up magnificently."
"Toss and teams: Bangladesh have won the toss and they will bowl first. Nazmul to Hopes, OUT Bangladesh strike, very poor stroke by Hopes, he tries to pull a short delivery but gets very early on the stroke, the top edge is taken easily by Mehrab at short midwicket, Hopes makes his way back as soon as he skies the Mortaza to Marsh, 1 wide strays too wide outside off, left alone and wide called Shakib to Clarke, OUT Clarke gets a little cheeky with the cut and pays the price, Shakib doesn't give him enough room to work with outside off and the ball skids through quickly, he tries to dab it down to third man, takes the outside edge and Shahadat to White, OUT that the end of Cameron White. Tries to steer it to third man exposing his stumps and the ball crashes into off stump Shahadat to Johnson, OUT banged in short and Johnson's pull gets a top edge which balloons for a simple catch for the bowler Shahadat to Hussey, OUT three wickets in four balls for Shahadat! short of a length, Hussey advances down the pitch and tries to scoop it over cover but fails to connect and that hits his off stump All you social networking freaks out there, add Cricinfo Widgets to your page today. Clark to Mehrab jnr, OUT Mehrab's gone! LBW. After feeding him a series of bouncers in the previous over, Clark pitches this one up and gets it to swing in to the left-hand batsman, raps his pads and he's gone Clark to Ashraful, 1 wide short and very, very wide. Ashraful chases it but doesn't connect. First ball and he goes for an extravagant shot! Clark to Tamim, 1 wide short delivery and wide. Tamim has shown he doesn't need a second invite for the cut and he throws his bat at it again but doesn't connect Johnson to Tamim, OUT Tamim falls, holing out to third man, that was short of a length but there wasn't enough room to cut. Tamim went for the cut anyway, but didn't get hold of it and Brett Geeves takes a fine catch at third man Johnson to Ashraful, OUT plumb in front and Bangladesh sink deeper, Johnson bangs it in back of a length and Ashraful eyes the deep square leg boundary, unfortunately he misjudges the lower bounce and is trapped right in front of middle, Peter Clarke to Shakib, OUT he had it coming, Shakib steps down the track to cart Clarke over long-on but makes a mess of a low full toss, he turns the face of the bat too early and the leading edge lobs to Stuart Clark at mid-off Clark to Raqibul, 1 wide drifts wide outside off, he thinks of chasing it but changes his mind Geeves to Dhiman, OUT First wicket in international cricket for Brett Geeves. Shortish delivery but excellent line just outside off and Dhiman Ghosh fishes at it giving Haddin a simple catch Geeves to Raqibul, OUT Another wicket for Geeves. Short and lifting towards Raqibul's helmet. He tries to fend it off, it takes the shoulder of the bat and flies to David Hussey at second slip White to Shahadat, OUT White gets three as Bangladesh slump to their lowest score ever. Shortish delivery outside off, tried to cut it, gets the bottom edge, ricochets off Haddin's thigh and Clarke dives forward from first slip to snaffle it in Another good day's work for Australia. Another demoralising loss for Bangladesh. The visitors' bowlers did an acceptable job but the batting was woeful and the old problems of going for their shots too early persists. Player of the match is Michael Hussey, AUS","Australia 8 for 254 (M Hussey 85, Marsh 76, Shahadat Hossain 3-42) beat Bangladesh 74 (White 3-5) by 180 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Shaun Marsh gave Australia a reasonable opening with 76 - two more than the tourists managed ? Getty Images Michael Hussey and Shaun Marsh proved that even an under-strength and comparatively under-prepared Australia are a major handful for Bangladesh, who crumbled to their lowest ODI score and a 180-run loss. Before the game Jamie Siddons, the Bangladesh coach, said a rusty Australia would still be very good and after they posted a challenging 254, Mitchell Johnson and Brett Geeves troubled the top order to set up the one-sided result. The build-up to the match was remarkably similar to the memorable 2005 contest in Cardiff when Andrew Symonds turned up to the ground under the influence of alcohol, was left out of the match, and Bangladesh scored a five-wicket win. This time Symonds was scratched because he had missed a team meeting due to a fishing trip on Friday, but his colleagues had no intention of letting the incident affect the outcome. Marsh and Hussey registered cautious half-centuries that stopped Bangladesh's bowlers gaining any momentum, although the attack was commendably tight at times."
"Toss, 9.00 am: Michael Clarke has won the toss and Australia will bat. They are fielding an unchanged XI and are wearing black armbands in memory of Col Egar, the former umpire and ACB chairman, who died on Friday. Mortaza to Marsh, 1 leg bye good length but the line is on leg stump, Marsh tries to work it off his hips but gets hit on the thigh for a leg bye behind square Shahadat to Marsh, 1 wide strays down leg side this time and that will be the first wide of the match Farhad to Marsh, OUT he's bowled him! Reza strikes with his first ball of the series, what a start! Reza pitches the ball on a good length just around off stump and nips it a fraction back into the left-hander, Marsh pushes forward in defence with a large gap between bat and pad, Reza finds it and the ball hits off stump, Marsh has monopolised the strike and ridden his luck so far but Farhad to Clarke, 1 wide that's far too wide outside off stump, he will have to re-bowl that one Farhad to Clarke, 1 wide that's extremely wide outside off stump, Clarke reaches out for it but the ball is just too far away Farhad to White, SIX runs he's smashed that! White backs away to make a bit of room, gets under a length ball, and pulls it high and far over deep midwicket, that's the first six of the innings Australia have batted 50 overs and scored less than 200 only 26 times. They've won 11 of those matches, says Travis Basevi. It is also only the second time a team has batted the 50 overs in the first innings and scored less than 200 and only lost five wickets. Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique are the openers. Bracken is opening the bowling, from over the wicket. Clark to Siddique, OUT that's a nasty delivery and Siddique's been caught! Clark banged the ball in short and it rose sharply on the left-hander, Siddique was caught in an awkward position and he fended at the ball to stop it from hitting him, the ball hit the glove and lobbed up over the wicketkeeper, White dived to his right and took the catch behind Haddin Bracken to Tamim, 1 wide short and wide outside off stump, Tamim tries to cut off the back foot but the movement away from him takes the ball even wider Clark to Shakib, 1 wide Clark strays down leg side, and that's a wide Hopes to Dhiman, OUT that's plumb, absolutely plumb, Hopes pitches the ball on a good length outside off stump and angles the ball into middle, Dhiman should have been playing forward and straight, instead he stays back in his crease and plays across the line, attempting to hit the ball towards midwicket, he misses and gets struck on the knee roll in front of middle Bracken to Razzak, SIX runs he's whacked that! Razzak picks the slower ball, moves his front foot out of the way, and swings his bat hard to dispatch the ball over wide long-on Clark provided the early wickets for Australia and Hopes struck three blows to Bangladesh's middle order. However, Bangladesh will be left to reflect on another terrible batting performance. They had a real chance of victory after their spinners - backed up by outstanding fielding - had restricted Australia to 198 for 5. They even had one batsman - Tamim Iqbal - who got stuck in.

AFP Tamim Iqbal's one-man entertainment show was not enough to turn Darwin into Cardiff as Australia wrapped up a 3-0 cleansweep with a 73-run victory over Bangladesh. Tamim mastered the slow surface better than anyone had all week. He showed more flair than Australia's key man Michael Hussey but only two of Tamim's colleagues reached double figures and three wickets to James Hopes led to a familiar result. Bangladesh were chasing 199, which despite their batting woes on this tour looked like a vaguely feasible target. When Tamim lashed the likes of Hopes and Mitchell Johnson there were some nervous flutters from Michael Clarke, who was part of the team when Bangladesh upset Australia in Cardiff in 2005."
"Toss: News from the center is that Bangladesh have won the toss and will bat first. Bracken to Tamim, OUT that didn't take too long! Bracken gets cracking swing straightaway, it first angles into Tamim, that draws him forward but the ball suddenly swerves the other way and a helpless Tamim forces an edge down to David Hussey at second slip who falls to his right Clark to Ashraful, 1 wide loses his line and strays wide down the leg side Bracken to Shakib, 1 wide slides down the leg side Hopes to Shakib, 1 wide Hopes strays down the leg side, wide called Johnson to Siddique, OUT Junaid loses his concentration, Johnson delivers that back of a length and the ball kicks up and holds its line, he fails to withdraw his bat on time and the thick edge is taken by Haddin White to Dhiman, 1 wide loses his line and sprays that wide down the leg side White to Razzak, OUT attempts a leg break and Razzak expects it to turn, the ball however goes through straight and Razzak can't get behind the line to defend, the outside edge lobs to Clarke at first slip Clark to Dhiman, OUT he goes for broke straight down the ground but makes a mess of it, he stays rooted to the crease as he faces up a full delivery from Clark, the top edge travels to Watson at mid-off who pedals backwards to take the catch, terrible shot and Ghosh will regret it Johnson to Shakib, 1 wide loses his line and strays wide down the leg side Johnson to Shakib, OUT hits a good length on middle and off, the ball swings in quite sharply with the angle and Shakib tries to whip it across the line, the ball hits the back pad and umpire Oxenford thinks for a while before raising the finger. You can argue that the ball may have missed leg stump but Shakib moved across a bit too much Hopes to Kapali, OUT very very soft dismissal, Kapali decides to take the aerial route this time but fails to execute it properly as he tamely chips a full delivery down to Watson at mid-off who's standing well forward from the conventional position, Bangladesh just can't get sizable partnerships going White to Nazmul, OUT all squared up by the googly, White mixes it up well, pitches outside off and cuts back in sharply, catches Nazmul on the back foot, that was fairly plumb in front Johnson to Mortaza, OUT terrific delivery from Johnson and that would have claimed even the best batsman, angles it into the right hander and lands it back of a length, the ball then moves away from Mortaza after pitching and all he can do is tamely edge it to Haddin Mortaza to Marsh, 1 leg bye on his legs, worked away to the leg side Shahadat to Watson, (no ball) oversteps and slides it wide down the leg side, Shahadat's trying his level best I can tell you Australia won by 8 wickets (with 164 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shaun Marsh, AUS","Australia 2 for 118 (Marsh 69*) beat Bangladesh 117 (Johnson 3-17) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Dhiman Ghosh provided a few highlights for Bangladesh but his innings was short-lived ? Getty Images Bangladesh improved marginally but still lost by eight wickets in Darwin, where Australia's bowlers set up an unassailable 2-0 series lead. Once again weighed down by batting lapses, Bangladesh struggled to 117 against an unforgiving attack and then found Shaun Marsh and his top-order colleagues equally merciless as they completed the chase within 23 overs. They wrapped up the result by 2.45pm, a time when most one-day internationals in Australia have barely started. Marsh finished unbeaten on 69 and firmed as a permanent opener in the limited-overs outfit."
"Siddle to Dhoni, SIX runs that gets the crowd animated! Siddle bangs it in short, Dhoni picks the length early and thwacks it just over the fine leg rope, a very well executed hook Lee to Ganguly, 1 leg bye another short ball and Ganguly shapes to pull again, the ball lobs off his body and Haddin flings himself to his right and gloves it down to fine leg, good attempt White to Harbhajan, OUT White strikes again! The one that goes through straight, he's almost made it his stock delivery, Harbhajan leaves a big gap between bat and pad as he tries to drive through the off side, the ball knocks back the off stump, lazy shot by Harbhajan White to Dhoni, SIX runs waltzes down the track, makes use of the flight and slams him against the turn over long-off, there were at least three fielders on the deep and he beat all of them White to Dhoni, OUT quite unnecessary there, White bowls seam up, Dhoni punches a skiddy delivery to Lee at mid-off and risks the single, Zaheer was always struggling and couldn't beat the throw despite the dive, Haddin whips the bails and Koertzen doesn't call for the third umpire, it was that obvious Siddle to Dhoni, OUT was he a little unlucky there? A big inswinger by Siddle, Dhoni moves across his stumps and attempts to work it to the on side for a single, it appears as if he got an inside edge onto his pads, Siddle is confident and Koertzen raises the finger, that may have missed the legstump as well, I need to see another replay of that So India finish with 469. We said earlier that if Dhoni comes good India will get somewhere close to 500. They should be happy with this but may be a trifle disappointed at how the innings ended.

Zaheer Khan nipped out three wickets in the space of four deliveries when play started, and though Michael Clarke resisted with 69, it was always going to be a matter of when India would take a 1-0 series lead. In terms of runs, it was Australia's biggest defeat since their 343-run loss to West Indies in Barbados in 1991. India had reduced Australia to 58 for 5 yesterday, but had to wait 84 runs for their next strike, after which proceedings resembled a bowling alley as Zaheer knocked over the lower order like nine-pins."
"Hauritz to Redmond, OUT Redmond falls right in to the trap and Hauritz has two after lunch!

Johnson bangs it in short but the batsman is better prepared now as he rocks back and pulls it with intent over deep square-leg Symonds to Fulton, OUT great reflexes from Katich! Symonds bowls it back of a length, Fulton reads the length early and shapes to pull but fails to clear short midwicket, Katich flings himself to his right and catches it with both hands, the Australians are really delighted for Symonds Clark to Taylor, OUT Taylor gets the slow death from Koertzen, Clark gets the ball to bend back in off the pitch, Taylor tries to flick across the line but the ball hits him just above the knee roll and in line with middle and leg stump at least, Koertzen thinks about it before giving him out, Hawkeye indicates that it hit him too high Clark to McCullum, SIX runs what a shot! Imperious stuff, Clark gives him width outside off and lands it on a good length, he flays at it and gets enough wood to to send it over the deep cover fence, the square boundaries are short here Lee to Flynn, OUT that's a ripper! Lee fires that from round the wicket, lands it on a good length and gets it to swing in sharply through the air, Flynn fails to get right behind the line and the ball clips his pad and cannons on to the top of the off stump, the bowling change has worked Lee to McCullum, 1 leg bye bowls the inswinger and slides down the legside, the ball brushes his pads and Haddin slides to intercept it Lee to O'Brien, OUT that's 50 wickets in the calendar year for Lee, he pitches it just back of a length outside off and O'Brien gets forward to defend, the thick outside edge is taken very well by Haddin who flings himself to his right, cups it with both hands and falls hard on his elbows Lee to Martin, OUT the middle stump is flattened and Vettori is stranded, Lee fires it full and gets it to swing in sharply, Martin fails to get bat on ball and the ball deflects off his pad and crashes on to the stump, it's also the 24th Test duck for Martin Lee finishes with 4 for 66 and NZ ed on a disappointing 270, after opting to bat.

AFP Brett Lee's five-wicket haul was responsible for another disastrous performance from New Zealand's ailing batting order as Australia stormed to an innings-and-62-run victory and a 2-0 series success. Run making has been a severe problem for the tourists throughout the contest, but they left their most inept performance till last on a friendly pitch, falling to 6 for 84 on the way to 203. Lee, who took nine wickets for a career-best match return, was not at his best during the India tour, but he has improved with each innings since coming home and re-affirmed his status as the attack leader by finding life in the dead surface. All the serious damage came in the first session when Lee blasted four wickets in a 10-over spell that cost 23 runs. The visitors started the fourth day 230 behind and were soon caught in a Lee whirlwind that resulted in a demoralising defeat in the final Test for the coach John Bracewell."
"2.02 pm West Indies have won the toss and chosen to bat first. Starc to Lewis, 1 leg bye full and tailing into leg stump at 148 kph, Lewis overbalances missing a flick and it comes off his pads behind square for a leg bye. Hazlewood to Hetmyer, OUT Hazlewood strikes to remove another batsman with this around the wicket angle back of a length. Hazlewood bangs this in on a fifth stump line, enough width to tempt Hetmyer into a back foot punch but there's a touch of variable bounce and it disrupts Hetmyer enough to produce an inside edge dragging onto the stumps. Hetmyer shapes like he wanted to swing his bat and destroy the stumps in frustration before opting to walk off Agar to Hope, OUT flight from Agar produces the edge to backward point! Agar kept on flighting these deliveries on fourth stump on a fullish length that Hope habitually groped at and this is yet another one where Hope pushes much too far in front of his body not really trying to score. The hard-handed shot balloons in the air between short third man and backward point but it is Marsh at backward point who charges forward and dives to pluck this inche Turner to Pooran, OUT my goodness! Bowled without offering a shot in a limited overs match?!?! Turner has been slanting every ball in from very wide of the crease and getting decent turn to most deliveries. Pooran strides forward to this ball that pitches on fifth stump on a good length and shoulders arms expecting it to straighten safely wide of off stump but it skids on as an arm ball and pings back off stump. It clips the very top of off to kick o Agar to Bravo, 1 wide full and drifting down leg, wide called. Agar to Bravo, OUT carved high in the air, taken at point! Poor choice from Bravo given the situation. Trying to go down the ground as he did earlier, slices off a thick outer part of the bat. He knew straightaway Starc to Pollard, OUT strikes first ball! What a change of bowling. Over the wicket, full at off stump, goes for the drive and lofts it to cover as he slices across the shot. Dangerous stroke on this surface Zampa to Holder, OUT cleans him up! Another poor stroke. Full at middle and leg, Holder swipes across the line and it takes the top of leg stump Starc to Lewis, 1 wide short, down the leg side...a bit of pressure back on Starc Zampa to Joseph, 1 wide slips the googly down the leg side Hazlewood to Joseph, OUT gem first up! What a bowler! He went mostly unrewarded in that new-ball spell but strikes immediately here probing straightaway on the fourth stump channel with a good length ball at 136 kph. Joseph prods forward but this clips the edge and carries through comfortably to Carey. Not much else Joseph could've done there. Starc to Walsh, OUT Walsh Jr can't survive the next ball. Pitched up fuller on leg stump and tries to produce a booming drive over long-off but instead just skies a chance to mid-off on the ring. Henriques backpedals from the ring and pulls off a sharp catch reaching above his head. Makes up for a sloppy drop at mid-off on a much easier chance when Pooran was on 26 two nights earlier. Starc to Lewis, 1 leg bye back of a length on the hips, swivels to pull and misses off the pads to square leg for a leg bye. Zampa to Hosein, OUT googly looks like it's cleaned up Hosein with a stumping. Flighted beautifully on fourth stump to suck him forward trying to flick through midwicket but it spins past the shot and his back leg overstretches on the shot. Carey is razor sharp whipping the bails off with his toe still in the air trying to get back into his ground. Wonderfully set up and cleverly executed. Zampa to Cottrell, 1 leg bye zips this in flat and quick outside leg stump, misses a flick but it deflects off the thigh wide of Carey through fine leg to allow Lewis to get back on strike. Zampa to Lewis, SIX runs meatball of a full toss on middle stump at thigh height, Lewis devours it in one bite chomping this high over the rope at wide long-on to bring up his 10th half-century in ODIs. Starc to Cottrell, OUT Starc was searching for a yorker but spears in a full toss at knee height on off stump at 142 kph. In truth it was a poor delivery but Cottrell shows what a tailender he is with an even worse attempt to stab it out. Flails at this while hopping away from the stumps and off stump is ripped out of the ground. The ball makes contact with the turf only after clanging into the timber. 5.55 pm Starc ends with 11 wickets in three matches in this ODI series. Another sharp spell from him but really Hazlewood was the bowler of the innings. 8-1-18-2 does not truly tell the story of how often he beat the edge and on another day he would've taken at least twice as many wickets. The spinners played their part as well. No weak links in the Australia attack today. Philippe and Henriques in the middle to open the chase. Henriques off strike, opening with McDermott out of the lineup. Cottrell with the new ball coming left-arm over the wicket. Hosein to Henriques, OUT no reprieve for Henriques this time! His tour from hell ends in a ball of flames. Hosein darts this arm ball in at 94 kph on off stump, Henriques shuffles across to defend down the wrong line well outside the line of the ball playing for turn and is thumped below the knee roll. Hosein, Hope, Pollard, everyone within vicinity of the bat goes up in an uproarious appeal and Joel Wilson gives this out immediately. Henriques walks Cottrell to Carey, 1 wide Bouncer outside off stump, too high. Wide signaled from square leg. Cottrell to Marsh, OUT bounced out! Short ball plan finally comes off! Angles a bouncer onto the legs at 133 kph, Marsh swivels to hook and he's a touch early as the ball comes off the back of the bat and feathers through to Hope whose footwork is marvelous as he takes another leg side chance standing upright rather than diving. Marsh walks rather than wait for the umpire's decision and is fuming with himself all the way to the dugout. Cottrell to Wade, 1 wide very short and very wide outside off, not sure if that stuck in the hand Walsh to Wade, 1 wide spins down the leg side, started a little too straight Hosein to Agar, 1 wide spins down the leg side from a middle-and-leg line Walsh to Wade, SIX runs no mercy! Half-tracker on the stumps at 85 kph, sits up for Wade to rock back to slaughter high and deep over midwicket, over the roof and out of the ground. Biggest hit of the match. Gregory Brathwaite trots out with a bag of replacement balls to choose from.

Nicholas Pooran was bowled without offering a shot AFP Australia's trio of spinners - the recalled Ashton Agar, Adam Zampa and Ashton Turner - shared five wickets with the tally matched by Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood as West Indies could only muster 152 having had the chance to bat first. Evin Lewis, who returned after retiring hurt in the fourth over after a blow on the helmet, was the only batter to pass 18. The chase wobbled to begin with and the spin of Akeal Hosein and Hayden Walsh Jr threatened to undo Australia's good work in the field, but a calculated positive approach from Wade, Alex Carey and Mitchell Marsh paid dividends as the target was quickly whittled down despite the loss of wickets. Marsh's 29 off 21 balls with three sixes made considerable inroads until he fell in a Sheldon Cottrell over that cost 17 - a sizeable chunk of a small chase."

AFP That it happened in the same city where Australia famously conquered the final frontier four years ago was poignant. India regained the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy, their first series win over Australia in eight years, after they bowled Australia out for 209 to win by 172 runs. It was a dramatic day, with an energetic India following up three early wickets with dropped catches to allow Matthew Hayden score a pugnacious 77 and give Australia a whiff of victory. India's spinners held their nerve, however, and relentlessly plugged away with precision and hostility to snuff out the seven wickets required to regain the trophy squandered in 2004. India confidently stepped into a new era with their captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, winning his third Test in a row."

Oram smashed six sixes in a 71-ball hundred, the fastest by a New Zealander, and he combined with Brendon McCullum in a 137-run stand at more than a run-and-a-half a ball. While they were always behind, the batsmen produced enough fireworks to spark a batch of local nerves.

Lee to Loye, OUT and he's gone now! wide ball outside off stump, Loye would have been better of letting that go but he went hard at it and the slash resulted in a thick outside edge that flew straight to Gilchrist Clark to Strauss, 1 wide slower ball but it's mis-directed down leg side Johnson to Strauss, OUT gone! that was too close to cut to third man and Strauss went for it anyway and got a thick edge to Gilchrist, Strauss has been playing that shot repeatedly today and a nick was always on the cards Lee to Joyce, OUT it wasn't short enough to pull and the line was outside off stump, Joyce tried to force it through midwicket and ended up getting a top edge to Mitchell Johnson at mid-on who took a comfortable catch, a very rash shot and England are slipping as they have done in previous matches in this series Johnson to Dalrymple, OUT Johnson strikes again! two in two overs and England's slump continues. Perfect line and length to the right-hander - good length, pitched close to the off stump line and shaping in late. Dalrymple had to play at it and the edge goes straight to Gilchrist behind the stumps. Johnson to Plunkett, OUT that's the end of that! Johnson once again drags it short and Plunkett plays the 'sitting duck act' to perfection, ball clips the shoulder of the bat and lobs up towards point. Clarke moves in quickly and makes no mistake.

After today's nine-wicket caning in a match lasting only 59 overs the same thought stands. Please can this be the turning point? There is still time for England repairs - the CB Series has just passed the halfway point and, amazingly, they could reach the finals easily - but on this performance they would have been lucky to have achieved anything positive in the World Cup warm-up for the minnows in Kenya. Throughout the tour Andrew Flintoff has spoken proudly about the strong spirit in the dressing room, but his men have been unable to transform the talk and have slumped horribly since a brief change of direction against New Zealand in Hobart. For some reason Adelaide, the most beautiful of grounds, turns England into their ugliest."
"Toss: New Zealand have won the toss and will bat. I'll have the team news shortly ... Lee to Astle, OUT caught!

Good length outside off stump, Fleming tries to loft it over the off side, he was not to the pitch of the ball and he hit it high on the bat to Hussey at mid-off, who takes an easy catch Clark to Taylor, OUT Clark gets another! Pitches short of a length on off stump, Taylor throws his bat at it and tries to heave it down the ground, he gets a lot of height on it but not the distance, Hussey back-pedals from mid-off and takes a well-judged catch Clark to Fulton, OUT Gotcha! Fulton perishes. Short of length, outside the off stumpm it goes straight on and Fulton plays a nothing shot, a lame push and steers it straight to Hayden at first slip. McGrath to McCullum, OUT and he's successful with his first ball! that pitched short of alength just outside off stump, McCullum moved across his stumps and got hit on the pads, the Australians go up in appeal and the umpire agrees, that might have struck him marginally outside the line of off stump McGrath to Franklin, OUT short ball yet again and this time Franklin connects with the pull, he pulls it straight to Matthew Hayden at deep midwicket, Hayden hardly had to move and took an easy catch McGrath to McMillan, OUT that's the end of a pugnacious innings! McGrath bowls a full toss, McMillan tries to hoick it down the ground and skies it back to the bowler, McGrath takes a simple catch, there's a bit of confusion as to whether the full toss was above waist height, McMillan hangs around for a bit but has to go in the end Bracken to Mason, OUT that's the end of that, Bracken bowls the effort ball, just a bit quicker and in the blockhole, Mason plays all around it and has his stumps re-arranged, New Zealand are bowled out for 218 Australia have done well to dismiss New Zealand for 218 after losing the toss. McGrath was impeccable with figures of 3 for 24 off his ten overs. Clark was more expensive but he did pick up four important wickets. McMillan led the way for New Zealand with 89 off 87 balls and it was his effort that took New Zealand to a score they can hope to defend if they bowl well.

Hussey's unbeaten 65 was the key in a tight run-chase of 219 and he brought up the win with a six in the 49th over. New Zealand pushed Australia to the very end but their decision to play only four bowlers cost them dearly as Craig McMillan and Nathan Astle proved too easy to score off in the dying overs. McMillan had already done his part with 89 in New Zealand's 219 but Hussey and Michael Clarke (75) earned Australia their fourth win of the series. Clarke's dismissal in the 38th over triggered a mini-collapse as Cameron White and Brett Lee fell soon after and when Nathan Bracken was caught with two runs required the outcome was still uncertain."
"Bracken to Loye, 1 leg bye Fuller and it swings in late, on the middle and leg side, Loye attempts to flick it away, the ball bobs away to short fine leg McGrath to Strauss, OUT Hodge you beauty! short of a good length delivery on the middle and off stump line, innocuous delivery. Strauss having failed playing the drive and the flick goes for the pull and the ball flies away towards midwicket. Hodge there quickly moves across to his left and pulls off a stunner, diving across to his left. He McGrath to Joyce, OUT and McGrath ends Joyce's uneasy stay at the crease with a beauty! short of a good length delivery, this one hit the deck and shaped back in. Joyce was clueless and in the end it was a nothing poke, ball clipped the inside edge and went straight to Gilchrist behind the stumps. That's the end of that and we are back to s Johnson to Flintoff, 1 wide high bouncer and the umpire is not impressed McGrath to PD Collingwood, OUT and the party continue! short of a good length, pitched right in the channel outside the off stump and shaping away late - special delivery for poor mortals and a McGrath usual. Collingwood had no option but to play at it and the edge went straight to Gilchrist behind the stumps. England five down and they are Lee to Nixon, OUT short of a good length delivery, pitched outside the off stump and angling away. Nixon stays back and pokes at it, playing well away from his body. Thick edge and the ball goes straight to Hayden at first slip who snaffles it as clean as a whistle. England six down. Lee to Flintoff, OUT Hodge pulls off another blinder and England's slump continues! good length and cutting in. Flintoff slogs it away towards midwicket. Hodge in the deep hurtles across to his left, drives across at the last movement and takes it with both hands. Fantastic bit of fielding. England seven down - just three more to go. Bracken to Lewis, OUT got'm! and once again it's the slower ball that does the trick. Low fulltoss on the middle and off stump line. Lewis jams his bat down, probably he thought it was the yorker. Ball hits the bottom part of the bat and spoons up straight back to the bowler. White to Anderson, 1 wide slips that down leg side. Wide called. White to Anderson, 1 wide googly but again down the leg side White to Dalrymple, OUT There you go. England shot out for 155. The awful summer continues. Short of length, outside the off stump, Dalrymple could have pulled it anywhere but he decides this is the time to end the misery and hits it right at the throat of long on. Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide Ala Harmison. Way outside off stump. Anderson to Hodge, OUT Hodge's one-day travails continue. Full and on the middle and leg, it holds its line a touch, Hodge looks to turn it the on side, gets a outer edge and it flies to point where Darlymple takes it right in front of his face. Australia lose their second wicket. No Ricky Ponting today. Under slight pressure Lewis to Symonds, (no ball) again that off stump line, pushed out to cover region Lewis to Symonds, OUT Revenge! Lewis sends Symonds packing. Again full and outside off stump line, looked pretty similar to the previous delivery but a tad wider, and Symonds throws his bat at it and gets a thick edge. Nixon goes airborne and takes it in front of first slip. Surely, hopefully for all of you out there desperate for a contest Flintoff to Hussey, 1 wide surprise bouncer and Hussey was caught on the wrong foot, in the end the ball angled away from the left-hander and Hussey safely swayed away from the line. Too high says the square leg umpire Tremlett to Hussey, 1 wide Tremlett gets the ball to swing a fair distance but he needs a new radar. Way down the leg side. 'That's a wide' is the verdict Flintoff to Hussey, 1 leg bye off the pads and the ball rolls away towards square leg, they scamper through for a single Flintoff to Clarke, 1 leg bye good length and drifting down the leg side, Clarke fails to make contact but the ball rolls away off the pad to short fine leg. End of a good over for Australia Lewis to Clarke, OUT and he strikes! good length and drifting down the leg side, Clarke follows the ball in a effort to clip it down to fine leg but fails to make solid contact. Not sure if there was any wood involved, hard to say from here. The keeper and the bowler were convinced and so was the umpire. That's the wicket they were looking Anderson to White, OUT Anderson strikes back for England and the see-saw battle continues. Good length delivery and this one nipped back in off the deck. White plays across the line and the ball thuds into the pad. Loud shout and on this occasion the umpire adjudicates in favour of the bowler. And that wraps our coverage for the day.

Getty Images A committed bowling display led by John Lewis eased England's pain, but it was not enough to prevent another defeat that was set up by a dire batting effort. After England spluttered to 155 all out in 42 overs on a strange surface, the home team copied the mistakes and dropped to 4 for 48 before sweating to a four-wicket victory. Despite gaining an unlikely position of strength through Lewis's three-wicket opening, England again released the pressure and Michael Hussey responded with a match-sealing 46. Hussey worked with Michael Clarke and Brett Lee, who finished on 20 after surviving a torrid spell from Andrew Flintoff, to steer the side out of trouble. However, they were fortunate to claim a bonus point from an encounter that turned out to be relatively even."
"Gillespie to Hayden, OUT Gillespie gets the first break-through, it was short and down the leg side, Hayden looking for the pull, gets the edge through to McCullum (off the glove), who takes the catch.

McMillan gets the breakthrough, and he's cock-a-hoop Bond to White, OUT gone! Bond fires it in full on the stumps and White makes room outside leg stump, looking to slog it away, but can only find McMillan at a deepish midwicket Bond to Symonds, OUT and he gets one more!

Adam Gilchrist set the tone with a typical one-day fifty, Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds consolidated after a few wickets, and then joined by the energetic Cameron White, Symonds took the bowlers to the cleaners.

The visitors lost their final seven wickets for 23 in a disappointing finish after Bond made a memorable impact to close the first innings. Andrew Symonds and Cameron White launched a late onslaught of 90 in nine overs before Bond ended the partnership in the 50th over when White was caught in the deep and Symonds edged behind next ball attempting a huge drive. Bond, who became the second New Zealander to take a one-day international hat-trick and collected 4 for 61, finished the job with a ripper that took the top of Nathan Bracken's off stump, but his team-mates failed to carry the momentum into their batting. Taylor, who came in at 2 for 7 in the fourth over, showed the 128 he made in his third ODI last month was no fluke and he was the only batsman to threaten Australia."

He bowls a knee-high full toss on the stumps and McCullum slams that superbly over deep fine leg for half a dozen! What a game this is! I need a breather and a nice stiff drink. Wow. If you thought the last match was a humdinger, well I'll tell you, this was something else. Bracken just lost the plot in the last over, offering a bleeding full toss to McCullum, a man whose reputation as a last-ditch scrapper has skyrocketed.

Getty Images Craig McMillan and Brendon McCullum blasted New Zealand to another massive run-chase as they negated Matthew Hayden's 181 and inflicted a cleansweep on Australia at Hamilton. The home team flew to 350 with only one wicket to spare on the back of McMillan's 117 and his 165-run partnership with McCullum. Their second-innings 340 at Auckland on Sunday - which was the second-highest chase in ODI history - was bettered again as McMillan showed contempt for the Australia attack despite coming to the crease at 4 for 41. He brought up his first limited-overs century since 2002 with two consecutive sixes off Adam Voges' left-arm orthodox spin, reaching the milestone from only 67 balls, which was the fastest by a New Zealander. He fell with 66 runs needed but McCullum took up the attack and with seven to win off the final over, and with nine wickets down, he launched a Nathan Bracken full toss over midwicket for six from the first ball then slashed behind point for four to win."
"Gillespie to Hayden, OUT Gillespie has the last laugh! pitched up on off stump, Hayden steps down, gives himself some room to swish it over the off side, fails to get the desired elevation and hits it to Vettori at mid-off who takes it low Tuffey to Hussey, 1 leg bye slower ball, drifting on the pads, ball rolls towards fine leg Vettori to Haddin, OUT Vettori strikes! tossed up on off and middle, Haddin gets forward, plays on the up and spoons it back to Vettori who takes it low, easy take in the end Bond to Hodge, (no ball) beamer! that one slipped out and Bond apologises Tuffey to White, SIX runs and another easy six! Tuffey drops this on on a length, Hodge gets to the pitch and slogs it over deep midwicket, just the right length to play that stroke Bracken to Taylor, 1 leg bye fraction short, hit on the pads Tait to Taylor, 1 wide short, wide and quick, Tait loses his direction, Taylor tries an upper cut but it was too fast for him Watson to Taylor, 1 leg bye back of a length, towards the pads, turned to square Hogg to Taylor, 1 leg bye hit on the full on the pads, drifts down leg, confident appeal White to Taylor, 1 wide way down the leg side Hogg to Taylor, 1 wide length ball outside the off stump, fielded by Haddin Hogg to McMillan, SIX runs flat and in the slot to sweep, McMillan gets on his knee and slog sweeps over deep midwicket, Maximum Hogg to Fulton, SIX runs swept again!

McGrath digs it in, McCullum waits on it, rocks on the backfoot and pulls it ferociously over deep midwicket What an amazing win for the home side and with that they have taken the series 2-0 and have also managed to topple Australia from their No.1 spot in the ICC rankings. Have your say New Zealand won by 5 wickets (with 8 balls remaining) Player of the match is Ross Taylor, NZ","New Zealand 340 for 5 (Taylor 117, Fulton 76*, McMillan 52, Watson 3-58) beat Australia 336 for 4 (Hussey 105, Hodge 97*) by five wickets Scorecard Ross Taylor took few risks on his way to his second one-day century ? Getty Images Australia fell from their No. 1 one-day ranking for the first time as Ross Taylor, Peter Fulton and Craig McMillan propelled New Zealand to their huge target of 337 with an over to spare to secure the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Taylor's century bettered the one Michael Hussey had made to set up Australia's total, which until New Zealand's chase was the highest ODI score at Eden Park. Taylor built the platform for the second-highest successful chase in limited-overs history with 117 before Fulton, and in particular McMillan, hammered Australia to all parts of the ground in the dying stages. McMillan's 52 from 30 balls was telling after New Zealand went into the last ten overs with 91 needed."
"Toss: New Zealand have won the toss and will bowl. Bond to Jaques, OUT Bond strikes, Jaques sees a short ball outside off stump moving away from him and decides to smash it, he goes on the back foot and reaches far out for the ball, the ball hits the toe end of the bat and spoons to Vettori at cover who takes the simplest of catches, perhaps the nerves got to Jaques Bond to Hayden, 1 wide oh that's very wide, with the movement Bond is getting he can't afford to pitch it that far outside off stump Bond to Hayden, 1 wide and another, far outside off stump Bond to Haddin, OUT bowled him! Bond pitches that just outside off stump and the ball swings in a long way, Haddin tries to hit it through the off side and plays all around it, the ball blasts between bat and pad and smashes into the stumps Gillespie to Hayden, OUT gone! Right after drinks! Gillespie bowls it a touch wider outside off stump, Hayden chases it and plays a half-drive/half-cut, he nicks it straight to Fleming at first slip who takes a simple catch Vettori to Hodge, OUT Fleming fumbles and then takes it! Hodge tries to cut once again and gets a thick edge on it, it flies quickly at stomach height to Fleming at first slip who doesn't take it cleanly at the first attempt, he manages to grab it as the ball bounces off his palms McMillan to Hussey, OUT big big wicket! McMillan bowls on a good length on off stump, Hussey goes for the drive and ends up hitting it on the up to Taylor at cover who dives forward to take a sharp catch, Fleming's decision to use McMillan pays off at once Bond to White, OUT You will not see a better caught and bowled! Bond bowls a slower ball full to White who drives back at the bowler, the ball flies low and to the right of Bond who is going the other way on his follow through, he stretches out his right hand and picks up the ball inches off the ground, rolls over and holds on, absolutely stunning catch, pure Bond to Bracken, OUT Bond lets a yorker rip, but it's a slower ball, Bracken backs away and tries to squeeze it on the off side, he misses and Bond hits the stumps, Australia are in shambles Bond led New Zealand's outstanding effort in the field. He now has 33 wickets in 10 ODIs at a staggering 13.12 apiece against them. Australia never lost a clutch of wickets together but they were just unable to score. The target of 149 may seem small on paper but conditions are not easy for batting and Australia will fight tooth and nail. Join me in about 35 minutes Bracken to Fleming, SIX runs full and wide outside off stump, Fleming gets forward and throws his bat at it, the ball hits the outside edge and flies high and over the third man fence! When you slash, slash hard. Watson to Vincent, SIX runs Waston bowls this one full and on middle and off stump, Vincent stands his ground and hits through the line, it's timed with awesome power and the ball sails over the straight boundary Watson to Fleming, SIX runs Fleming pulls for six, he used Watson's pace and just swivelled and slammed it over the deep backward square leg fence Hogg to Fleming, 1 wide slips down leg side, wide called It's been 22 years since New Zealand last had an opening-stand of over hundred against Australia. Australia have been defeated by ten wickets for the first time in ODI history today. They were missing five key players - Ponting, Gilchrist, Clarke, Lee and Symonds - but they have been humiliated.

Getty Images Shane Bond's love of hurting Australia pushed New Zealand to their third win in five years of Trans-Tasman contests and added to the visitors' severe woes. On the day when Australia's under-strength squad was hit further by the loss of Brett Lee and Michael Clarke to injuries, Bond made their situation much worse by capturing 5 for 23 as they toppled to their first ever ten-wicket loss. Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming powered past the tiny target of 149 in the 27th over and Australia must win the final two matches of the Chappell-Hadlee Series to hold their No. 1 ranking. Bond was magnificent on a pitch offering steep bounce and movement and he struck in his first and last overs while taking his tally against Australia to 33 wickets in ten games."
"2.05pm England have won the toss and will bat. Both sides are unchanged and despite forecasts of poor weather, the sun is shining and we are set for a prompt start. There is a lot of rain to the south, however, so fingers crossed. Lee to Loye, (no ball) outside off, too wide to tempt Loye but wide enough for the umpire to signal it McGrath to Joyce, OUT short, Joyce looked to pull but didn't time it, didn't commit to hitting over the infield and Brad Hodge takes a really good catch with a full-length dive to his left at midwicket Watson to Loye, 1 wide way outside off stump and swinging further away McGrath to Loye, 1 leg bye angled into the pads, Loye sizes up a flick off one leg, but can't get bat on it. Bobbles into space behind square nonetheless Bracken to Strauss, OUT loose drive outside off stump, minimal footwork and Gilchrist holds an edge at chest height to his left. A good delivery which seemed to pick up some zip off the pitch Hussey to PD Collingwood, 1 wide leg-side wide, Gilchrist whips the bails off Hogg to Flintoff, 1 leg bye loud appeal, but hugely optimistic as the batsmen cross for another extra McGrath to PD Collingwood, no run lovely nagging length, six inches outside off. Collingwood tries to work it to leg, but no gap there Lee to Flintoff, OUT superb reflex catch ... driven hard back at Lee, right into his hands, and he does really well to cling on to it in his follow through ... it was at a perfect height but it was travelling Bracken to PD Collingwood, OUT with third man up, Collingwood tries to reverse sweep but the ball glances off the face of the bat and Gilchrist barely has to move McGrath to Nixon, OUT full toss, launched right down the throat of the man five yards inside the rope at cow corner. McGrath gives a wry smile and a shake of the head as his team-mates leap on him. A really tight last ten overs from Australia that might be the difference between the sides. England were again indebted to Paul Collingwood as well as Andrew Flintoff - the two added 97 for the fifth wicket - but Australia bowled well and fielded superbly. We'll be back at 7.15pm (0815GMT) for the second innings. Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide poor start, a wide well down the leg side Plunkett to Ponting, 1 wide wide of off stump and that's a very harsh call. Swinging gently away to the slips but Ponting could have played it if he wished Plunkett to Ponting, OUT GOT HIM! That's a massive breakthrough, and it's all credit to Plunkett there. Perfect line and length, just outside off and swinging away again, Ponting pushes with hard hands, and Andrew Strauss at slip takes a fine low catch! Plunkett to Gilchrist, 1 wide another one down the leg side. These are a bit wasteful Plunkett to Gilchrist, OUT massive start for England! Beautiful delivery from round the wicket, tailing in late, beating a loose drive from Gilchrist and clipping the top of off stump! Perfect resumption from Plunkett, do England have the CB Series trophy within their grasp? Dalrymple to Hodge, 1 leg bye leg side, flicked with the spin to Panesar on the 45 PD Collingwood to Watson, OUT Oh my word. That is a brilliant catch. It was wide, Watson drove it uppishly to the left of backward point and Dalrymple leapt full length and took a one-handed catch four feet off the ground. There were gasps from the crowd as that was replayed. Dalrymple to Hogg, 1 wide leg side full toss, wonderfully taken at his feet by Nixon Dalrymple to Hodge, SIX runs a big swat over midwicket about 20 rows back Well, that's the end of a long series and for Australia a defeat which is not the end of the world but which does raise some questions so soon before the World Cup.

Getty Images England sparked the shock of the season by handing Australia their first home finals defeat for 14 years in a dramatic rain-reduced game at the SCG. On the same ground where a demoralised England handed over the Ashes last month, Andrew Flintoff completed a smaller but highly satisfying clean sweep by taking the CB Series in two games. The Australians were shocked - and probably embarrassed - when they flopped to 5 for 63 in the 12th over chasing a revised total after Paul Collingwood drove England to 8 for 246. Rain offered a brief reprieve for Australia when it came with the match needing another 22 balls for a result, but the sky cleared for long enough and they lost by 34 runs on Duckworth-Lewis when more wet weather arrived. ""To pit our wits against Australia in a final is a great thing for us with a group of young guys,"" Andrew Flintoff said."
"Toss: Stephen Fleming has won the toss and New Zealand will bat. Lee to Vincent, (no ball) 147 kmh from Lee and he over-steps this time, Voincent lets it go wide outside the off stump Lee to Fleming, OUT Lee strikes!

Tait digs it in short at 153kmh, Vincent tries to duck out of the way, the ball hardly rose as much as Vincent expected and thudded into his back Lee to Fulton, 1 wide down the leg side Johnson to Vincent, 1 wide short of a length ball but fired down leg side, Vincent swivels and tries to pull, wide called Clarke to Vincent, 1 wide slips down leg side, wide called White to Fulton, 1 wide slips down leg stump again, Fulton tries to sweep but misses, wide called, Fulton is exposing leg stump as he moves across his stumps Clarke to Fulton, OUT LBW! The sweep does Fulton in. Clarke pitches that just outside off stump, Fulton goes down on one knee and tries to sweep, he misses and the ball hits him just in line of off stump, replays show that the ball would have hit middle and off stump Clarke to Taylor, 1 leg bye fired down leg side, clips the pad for a leg bye to short fine leg Tait to Vincent, OUT good length ball on off stump swinging into Vincent, he tries to flick but the ball beats him and hits the pad before going on to hit the stumps, Tait gets his reward for an outstanding spell, he's bowled at a terrific pace all day and with much more control Clarke to Taylor, OUT bowled him! Clarke bowls that fast and a fraction shorter on off stump, Taylor makes a little bit of room and tries to play the slog sweep, he misses and Clarke hits Clark to Styris, OUT full toss on middle and leg stump, Styris hits it well off his pads but picks out Hussey at deep midwicket, Hussey takes a relatively simple catch and New Zealand are six down Clark to McCullum, OUT outstanding yorker, right up there in the blockhole, McCullum tries to hit it down the ground and the ball squeezes under his bat and rattles leg stump Vettori to Hodge, 1 wide Vettori strays down leg side, wide called Vettori to Hodge, 1 wide Vettori loses control and sends it wide outside off stump Vettori to Ponting, SIX runs huge huge hit from Ponting, he gets down the track and to the pitch of the ball, the ball doesn't turn much and finds the middle of the bat, it sails high over the long-on fence Franklin to Ponting, 1 leg bye slips down leg side, Ponting moves across and gets a bit of pad on it for a leg bye behind square Hodge leaves the ground to massive cheers.

Getty Images Ricky Ponting quickly returned Australia's winning habit with a calm century and Brad Hodge sealed his short-term future with an unbeaten 99 as they beat New Zealand by five wickets. Chasing a ground-record target of 291, Australia started slowly before warming up through a two-paced partnership of 154 between Hodge and Ponting that forced New Zealand to fight with England on Tuesday for a spot in the finals. After missing the 92-run loss on Friday - the first of Australia's summer - Ponting was determined to prevent another defeat and he produced a superb performance against a testing attack. Hodge, who replaced the injured Andrew Symonds, had scores of 0 and 1 in his two previous appearances and arrived to a ""pressure cooker"" atmosphere, but he walked off his home ground having hit the final runs. ""To win a game at the MCG is a dream come true,"" he said."
"2.00pm Andrew Flintoff wins the toss. England will bat. Bracken to Joyce, 1 wide outside off, tight call, but that won't improve Bracken's mood Clark to Loye, 1 wide wider, and Loye flinches in his eagerness to have a mow, but managed to restrain himself McGrath to Loye, OUT GOT HIM! McGrath dropped it short, as he was bound to do, and Loye tried to keep things positive by playing the hook. But it was a stroke played with no conviction, and a steepling top-edge ended in the hands of deep square-leg! Bracken to Bell, 1 leg bye outside leg, takes the thigh pad, but that's another good quick single. Good communication White to Bell, 3 wide loose again. Short, rank and leg-sided. Bell misses with his swing, but so does Gilchrist with his take White to Bell, 1 wide loose again. Not good bowling McGrath to Bell, OUT and the drinks break brings a breakthrough once again! And it's that old shark McGrath who does the job. It was short, Bell went for a big swing, and Gilchrist steadied himself under a big top-edge Tait to Nixon, OUT another one banged in, and this time Nixon plays a really nothing semi-pull shot which lobs to extra cover. A short and certainly not sweet stay. There's an extra catcher at gully Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide too much swing that time, and rightly called wide. But this is encouraging for England Plunkett to Hodge, 1 wide that's a harsh call. And Nixon behind the stumps mutters his indignation Mahmood to Hodge, 1 wide erratic - started outside off and swung further away Mahmood to Clarke, 1 wide oops, wide and wider Flintoff to Hayden, 1 wide down the leg-side. These extras are adding up Plunkett to Clarke, no run good delivery - fuller and bends round the edge of Clarke's bat. Six of those an over would suit England Mahmood to Hayden, 1 wide short and wild down the leg-side. Symonds flexes some more Mahmood to Hayden, OUT there's the breakthrough! And it's that man on the drive who does the trick. Lots of width from Mahmood, Hayden went for a big booming drive and it's a smart reflex take from Jamie Dalrymple at short cover! Not the best ball, but the best result as far as England ar Panesar to Bracken, OUT beautiful ball! Tossed right up, much much slower, and Bracken played all round it as the ball crashed into middle and leg.

"Toss Ricky Ponting has won the toss and decided to field. He reckons there is a bit of moisture in the pitch that will help his bowlers. A bit! Bracken to Tamim, OUT Got 'em. Bracken takes the pace off the ball and drops it at a good length. Tamim on his knees and thinking of the slog sweep. Then he realises it's too wide and decides to go with the slap over the bowler's head. Can't get the timing yet again and only manages a tame catch to Brad Hogg at mid-off. One down. McGrath to Nafees, OUT Touche! 132.3mph. That's No.55 for GD McGrath, equalling Wasim Akram's record for the most World Cup dismissals. Yorker homing in on middle stump. Too quick for Shahriar and was nailed all ends up. Plays all over it and loses his off stump. GD McGrath, take a bow! McGrath to Shakib, 1 wide Has Halley's comet struck? A wide way down leg side from Mcgrath. Gilchrist dives full length and collects it. McGrath to Aftab, OUT Catch! You beauty! Back of a length on off, Aftab down the track and tries to drive over mid-off but can't get the timing. Just like Tamim. It appears to have the elevation to beat mid-off but, Oh, look who's there. Nathan Bracken times his jump perfectly and latches on to the ball while in mid-air. You specy! McGrath becomes the McGrath to Ashraful, OUT Goodbye Mr Ashraful. Slow delivery from the master. Good length on off and tempting, very tempting. Ashraful makes room again and tries to clear mid-on but is deceived by the pace. Ball soars high in the air, Ponting back-peddles and takes a well-judged catch. McGrath's spell reads 3.5-0-9-3. Bread and butter for Pidge Bracken to Habibul Bashar, 1 wide Around the wicket, full but too wide down leg. Basher tries to work it away but it's too far away Bracken to Habibul Bashar, OUT Another slower ball does the trick. Bracken rolls his fingers over that one and drops it slightly short outside off. Basher pulls it feebly but can't beat Ricky Ponting at short midwicket. Easily done. So Bangladesh have managed 104 for 6 in their 22 overs. They tried to go after the bowling from the word go and lost wickets in the process. Glenn McGrath led the way in his metronomic style while the spinners chipped in well later on. All six wickets were taken by the faster bowlers, though, Australia should not have much of a problem overhauling this. Join Welcome back for Australia's chase. They need 105. Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist are making their way out to join the rest in the middle. Mashrafe Mortaza has the ball in his hands. Shakib to Hayden, SIX runs That's a biggie! Hayden charges down the ground, meets the ball on a half-volley and lofts it straight way, way back into the stands. It was muscled that one and Hayden can beef them spectacularly Shakib to Hayden, SIX runs It's all over. Slog swept way over midwicket this time. He can be dynamite this man. Matt the Bat finishes it in style. So Australia wrap up the first ten-wicket win in this World Cup. It was an expected victory but they went about in in clinical style. Bangladesh let themselves down with the bat and never really had a chance once they made just 104. Hayden and Gilchrist are as devastating an opening pair as any and they completed the job in just 13.5 overs.

AFP Australia were always favourites to bludgeon Bangladesh, but the fact that their Super Eights match was reduced to a mere 22-over-a-side affair made the thrashing appear much more severe. After putting Bangladesh in and keeping them to 104 for 6 - Glenn McGrath picked up 3 for 16 to become the highest wicket-taker in World Cup history - the rampaging Australians barnstormed to the first ten-wicket win of the tournament. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden give bowlers nightmares at the best of times, and when they come out to bat with a license to hit every ball out of sight, and end up doing almost just that, the only emotion you feel is sympathy for those at the receiving end. Gilchrist hit back down the pitch with such exquisite timing that the fielders at mid-on and mid-off had no chance whatsoever. Hayden, who was literally licking his lips at the prospect of nine of the 22 overs being compulsory Powerplays in the rain-affected circumstances, struck sweet blows of his own, but for once was overshadowed."
"The toss: Mark Nicholas was down with the two captains, and looked on as Brian Lara won the toss and elected to field on a virgin strip. The West Indies have brought in Corey Collymore for Ian Bradshaw. Australia have fielded the same side from the win over South Africa, meaning Andrew Symonds is preferred over the in-form Brad Hodge. Powell to Gilchrist, OUT edged and gone! Powell bangs in a shorter one at a good pace, lands on about middle and leg and moves in a tad, Gilchrist hops up and defends, maybe he was trying to get bat out of the way, but there's the thinnest of edges through and Ramdin moves to his right and holds a good catch low down! Gilchrist starts to walk before Asad Ra Powell to Ponting, SIX runs bang, thats six! Powell decides to bounce him but the lack of carry does him in, Ponting just swivels on one foot and hooks it over deep backward square leg for half a dozen! Shot! Taylor to Ponting, OUT and a piece of brilliance gets rid of a brillant batsman! A good length delivery outside off stump, Ponting lunges forward and drives into the covers and sets off, Sarwan collects the ball and has one stump to aim at, and doesnt miss! A superb throw that catches Ponting just short of his crease, even though he was going full stretch! Collymore to Hayden, 1 wide full ball down the stumps, Hayden looks to clip it, theres a noise and Ramdin takes it , then they all go up in appeal, umpire Rauf stands unmoved and then after a few seconds signals wide Collymore to Hayden, 1 leg bye he steps to leg, exposing the stumps, Collymore fires it in short on leg stump, Hayden has to adjust to dabble it off the pads for one to short fine leg Bravo to Clarke, OUT and Bravo gets his man! Clarke plays half-cock forward to one that moves in appreciably from outside off stump, gets rapped on the leg, everyone appeals and after a good thought umpire Rauf raises the dreaded finger Samuels to Hussey, 1 wide he tries too much and ends up firing one well wide of off stump for a wide Collymore to Watson, SIX runs great improvisation from Watson! Ambles across to off, goes down on one knee, and scoops this high around the corner for six! Top shot! Bravo to Hayden, OUT full in the zone, no room to work with, and Hayden scoops this in the air straight down the throat of Samuels at long-off, and an excellent innings comes to an end Bravo to Hogg, 1 leg bye full down leg, Hoggs already taken guard well outside leg stump and cant work it away, ends up with a leg-bye to square leg Powell to Hussey, OUT bowled 'em! Hussey reaches out to drive a very full delivery and ends up dragging it back onto off stump! A tame dismissal and Powell's gotten a second in his final over! Collymore to Watson, 1 leg bye full outside off stump, Watson comes well outside the line in an attempt to paddle it fine, the ball hits him on the full and he steals a leg-bye in front of point Bravo to Watson, 1 wide full down leg side, wide called Definitely not good news for the fans out there right now. That means, probably, that if there's no play today, West Indies will still chase 323 with a full 50 overs tomorrow. And thats only if a calculation has been made that they stick to that.

Just waiting for the two West Indian openers now... Chanderpaul and Gayle stroll, casually, out into the middle. No rush. Smallish crowd so far, just a sprinkling around the ground, but it will no doubt fill up quickly...and very quickly if (Chris) Gayle Force blows in. Bracken to open the bowling around the wicket, and he seems to have a very effeminate hair band on.

This is even wider of the leg stump. A comprehensive wide, if there is such a thing, swinging wider still Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide quick. Quick ball, 91mph (146ish kph) outside off. Chanderpaul goes for a Caribbean slash, but misses it by miles Tait to Lara, 1 wide miles wide of the off stump, although not quite a Harmiwide. Tait looks as confused as anyone Hogg to Lara, 1 wide short and down the leg side Symonds to Powell, 5 wide the wrong line, drifting down the leg stump and it races for four.

AFP West Indies, who fancy their chances to be the first host team to win a World Cup, suffered their opening loss of the tournament, a thumping one at that, against a rampant Australia that is slowly building up ominous momentum. Matthew Hayden set the game up with an innings of tremendous control and power on a first day cut in half by rain, and the bowlers backed it up with a cool performance on the second. Chasing 323 against Australia's varied attack is a tough ask at the best of times. Fortunately for the West Indians, the dampness caused by the overnight drizzle at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua did nothing to cause exaggerated assistance for the fast bowlers early on. Nathan Bracken was steady, moving the ball a touch, but the approach of West Indies' openers was strange."
"Pollock to Hayden, SIX runs Boom! Boom! A shimmy down the track and he imposes himself: Swings it over the cow corner. Australia are on zooming here. Langeveldt to Gilchrist, OUT Soft dismissal. South Africa heave a sigh of relief. A slower one on the off stump line and Gilchrist is done in by the change in pace. He shapes to cut but the ball stops on him and he sends a dolly to Gibbs at backward point. What a frenetic start it has been. It was all on a fast-forward motion. No pause or stop button in sight. Until this happenned. Langeveldt to Ponting, 1 wide swing and a miss. Down the leg side and Ponting tries to play a pick-up shot. Langeveldt to Hayden, 1 wide speared down leg side, Hayden goes for the flick but can't make contact. Wide called. There have been just three extras in the innings so far, no time in between the fours and sixes it seems Pollock to Clarke, 2 wide drifting on to the pads, Clarke tries to flick, misses. So does Boucher. Wide called. Hall to Hussey, OUT Holed out. Half-volley on off stump and Hussey tries to loft it over extra cover. Kallis makes good ground and takes a good catch while moving back. Hussey can't manage to clear the short boundary and South Africa limiting the damage here. Ntini to Ponting, OUT Punter is gone. Caught at long on. Goes down on a bent knee and disposes a fullish delivery down the ground. de Villiers didn't have to move an inch and takes it. Ponting exits and enter another big-hitter Andrew Symonds. Roy is in. No breathing space for SA. Smith and de Villiers are out there. The chase is about to begin. Bracken to de Villiers, SIX runs FIrst six of the chase. Comes via thrillingly skillful stroke. It was back of length delivery on the middle stump line and he short-arm jabbed it over deep midwicket. Stunning stroke. Tait to de Villiers, 1 wide Another wide down the leg side. If you have been following Tait's career, this won't be come as a surprise. Watson to Smith, SIX runs take that! Smith advances down again and deposits it down town over long-on Watson to Smith, 1 wide way outside off stump, Smith can't reach it. The Australian players go into a huddle. Hands over each other's shoulder. They really wanted this one in the bag. Slowly.... they break away and walk towards the pavilion. Player of the match is Matthew Hayden, AUS","Australia 377 for 6 (Hayden 101, Ponting 91, Clarke 92) beat South Africa 294 (de Villiers 92, Smith 74) by 83 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith blitzed away in the early stages, but South Africa couldn't sustain their attack ? AFP The first-round match between South Africa and Australia threatened to be a repeat of the epic at the Wanderers, but St Kitts' Warner Park is no Wanderers, and history steadfastly refused to repeat itself. Australia comfortably defended their 377 for 6, which was set up by Matthew Hayden's fastest World Cup century, and South Africa finished 83 runs adrift. Adam Gilchrist and Hayden put on a century opening stand in less than 15 overs, setting up a launching pad from which the middle-order could wade into the bowling. South Africa's innings started in a similar same way and it was AB de Villiers who ignited the run chase of 378. He stated his intentions emphatically in the first over by crashing a boundary and then following it with an audacious short-arm jab that sailed over midwicket for six."
"Toss Australia have won the toss and will bat first. Jonkman to Gilchrist, (no ball) From round the wickets, comes a length-delivery, angling in, Gilchrist tries to whip it to on side and gets a inside-edge onto his pads. No ball though. Jonkman to Gilchrist, 1 leg bye Fab delivery. It swung in late from outside off and Gilchrist is beaten by the movement and is rapped on the pads - it was going down leg side and the ball went to left of gully. They rush for a quick single, a shy comes at the striker's end, misses but Hayden would have made it. Reekers to Hayden, 1 leg bye gentle seam-up delivery on the legs, shovelled away towards square-leg Jonkman to Hayden, SIX runs Bosh! Short and Hayden pulls it over deep midwicket. Caught by a man from Boony Army! Pity for Holland that he was standing in the stands! de Leede to Hayden, OUT Hayden falls going for the broke. Slow offcutter outside off stump, Hayden has one wild swing, and edges it to Borren at point. Ryan ten Doeschate to Ponting, 1 wide gets it straighter, on the middle stump line, driven to mid-on Ryan ten Doeschate to Ponting, 1 leg bye Short of length, on the off and middle stump line, Ponting shapes to pull but is beaten by the bounce and the pace. I mean lack of it. It didn't rise high nor did it come through. And it bounds off the pads to the backward point region de Leede to Ponting, SIX runs Oh ho! There goes Ponting. Probably he was enraged by the earlier appeal. He leans forward to swing it over long-on! de Leede to Gilchrist, OUT Gilchrist is back into the hutch! Full in length, on the middle and leg stump line, driven uppishly straight to mid-on who makes no mistake. He holds on to it and only then throws the ball up in the air, unlike the earlier let off to Ponting. Ryan ten Doeschate to Ponting, OUT Wow what a fantastic catch by ten Doeschate! Ponting smashes a low full toss, low to the right of the bowler, who swoops down in a hurry to take the catch. Fab effort. Borren to Hodge, OUT Hodge falls. What a knock it has been. A real blitz. The end came as he tried to go for another big one. A fullish delivery, on the off and middle stump line and Hodge shapes to swing it away, misses it completely and is cleaned up. Ryan ten Doeschate to Clarke, 1 wide another wide down the leg side de Leede to Clarke, 1 leg bye huge shout for lbw. Full-pitched, just outside off stump, comes back in and beats the intended drive and raps him on the front pad. But point of impact was outside off stump. Ryan ten Doeschate to Hussey, OUT Hussey goes. He smashes a fullish delivery to long-on but couldn't clear the man at the deep. He had to go for it, just one more over left. Tait to Zuiderent, 1 wide slips down the leg side. Wide called. Tait to Reekers, 1 wide well outside off stump, Reekers chases it but can't reach it Tait to Ryan ten Doeschate, 1 wide well outside the off stump, left alone. Bracken to van Bunge, SIX runs Meaty blow over long-off. Van Bunge leans forward and just goes through with the line. Up and over she soared.

AFP The minnow-bashing was not as brutal as South Africa's, but Australia motored along like a well-oiled machine and exploded during the final overs to bat The Netherlands out of the match with 358 for 5. After being stranded in the nineties twice this year, Brad Hodge reached his maiden one-day hundred during what was a perfectly paced innings. Defending 359 was always going to be a cake walk and Australia's battery of fast bowlers was too hot for The Netherlands to handle and they were skittled for 129. The pitch was a belter and Ricky Ponting jumped at the chance of more batting practice. Adam Gilchrist provided the propulsion at the start, but once Australia lost him and Ponting with the score on 116, Michael Clarke and Hodge were impossible to contain during their partnership of 204."
"In 1979 WC, the first three matches, the teams which won the toss inserted the opposition in to bat. Just like this WC. Brown to Gilchrist, OUT Dougie nails Gilchrist. Scotland fielders mob the bowler. Plumb in front. Full and straight on the middle stump line, Gilchrist tries to swing it across the line on a bent knee. No wood on leather and the ball thuds into the pad. Dea Haq to Hayden, OUT Gotcha! Round the wicket again and the ball pitches on middle and turns away. Hayden tries to drive through the on side but can't account for the spin after the ball grips the surface. Loud appeal and 'slow death' Steve Bucknor raises the Haq to Ponting, 1 leg bye Comes down the track, tries to drive but gets it on the pads and they will cross over Brown to Ponting, 1 bye drifts away, in the air, outside off, full in length, Ponting reaches out for it, doesn't make contact and the ball bounds of the 'keeper's pad Rogers to Hodge, OUT turns in from outside off, Hussey goes back, eases it to cover region Wright to Ponting, OUT He is gone! He attempts another slap-slog, across the line, makes no contact and his offstump is pegged back. Haq to Clarke, OUT Gotcha! Haq cleans up Clarke. Flat and fast as the offspinner pushed that one through, slightly short as well and Clarke goes for a pull but is beaten by the pace. The middle stump is pegged back. Hoffmann to Hussey, OUT Colin Smith .... you beauty. Smart work behind the stumps. Full in length and angling away, Hussey makes no contact with his intended drive and his back foot is in the air. Smith gathers and quickly whips off the bails even as Hussey Hoffmann to Hogg, 1 wide wide outside off stump. Gopalakrishna, who is having a field day today, throws up another one. Out of 29 instances of totals over 300, 18 have come up against non-Test playing nations. This includes some games against Sri Lanka when they were not in the Test panel. Tait to Haq, 1 wide Typical. A wide delivery outside off. Tait to Poonia, OUT Ripper! Full ball this time and swinging in from outside off. Poonia tries to get his bat down in time but can only end up playing all over it. Ball beats him for pace and clatters into the middle and leg stumps. Too fast and too furious. Tait to Wright, OUT Gone. That's much better. Full and straight and screaming quick. Wright shuffles across the crease and is a sitting duck in front of the wicket. Struck on the pads and Asoka de Silva has no hesitation in giving the decision. Plumb as it Tait to Rogers, 3 wide And there we go again. Way, way down leg side. Past the batsman, past Gilchrist and almost past the diving Bracken at fine leg. But he stops the boundary Hogg to Smith, OUT Sharp turn there! Cleans up Smith. Lands outside off stump and spins back sharply. He shapes to cut but is surprised by the turn and its all over. Good outing for Smith.

Getty Images The Australia fast bowlers might have hogged a bit of the glory, blasting out the Scotland top order for not too many, but the 203-run victory was set up when Ricky Ponting carved out an authoritative hundred. Several others chipped in as Australia posted a virtually unattainable - for Scotland - 334 for 6. Ponting came out to bat with a solid platform in place, the score reading 91 for 1, and the best of the bowling conditions were already gone. He did not go hammer and tongs early on. If anything, he was extra careful, but the ease with which he was picking off the runs off the full stuff egged the Scotland bowlers to slip in the odd short ball."
"9.40am Sorry that this is becoming more like the Meteorological Office website ... rain has stopped, covers being unpegged in preparation for the toss ... but although there has been no announcement, it's been delayed as it should be happening now. But we are told the start will now be at 10.15am. Mad V emails to point out that Channel 9 and Fox delayed showing the toss while their experts predicted that Australia would bat if they won it. And, lo and behold, when they showed the delayed transmission, that's what happened. Otherwise, check out Sambit Bal's blog from the final. He likes blogs, does our Sambit. Until not so long ago, they would have started the match today and carried on into a second day to ensure both teams got the full 50 overs. The change is for TV companies, who hate their schedules being mucked up. But this is the biggest match in the game. Everything else has been sold out by the ICC, surely for one match they could put cricket before cash? Rant over. 10.35am Back come the main covers as the drops of rain that remained become heavier. This is all very tedious. The delay means that over deductions will kick in fairly soon. We are trying to find out exactly when. ""The tournament has lost its charm right from the beginning with India and Pakistan being out in first round, rain spoiling so many matches and now final too,"" emails Piyush..""Its been dragging on and on."" Many have argued that the World Cup has been poor because of India and Pakistan's elimination. A few have suggested that both should be guaranteed semi-final berths ... Murali to Gilchrist, 1 wide down the leg side, but only just...harshly wided by the umpire Murali to Gilchrist, SIX runs but there he goes, and it's another huge slog-sweep over midwicket, in front of square. It's gone 10 rows back - a vast hit Malinga to Hayden, OUT Finally! Mahela Jayawardene pulls off a smart catch at cover and Hayden has to go. He tried to club it over the short extra-cover fielder but Mahela was waiting there. He timed his jump well and pulled off a double-handed take while in mid-air. Hayden's useful hand comes to an end. It was a 55-ball 38 but nobody will complain when your partner is going banana Jayasuriya to Gilchrist, SIX runs Brutal. Power and timing all the way to midwicket. Gilchrist down the ground in a twinkling flash and blitzes a smooth pendulum swing that soars the ball way over midwicket for a maximum Fernando to Gilchrist, OUT finally finally they get Gilchrist out, Fernando bangs one short, Gilchrist swivels and tries to pull even though the length isn't short enough for the stroke, he gets a top edge and skies it straight to midwicket where Chamara silva takes an easy catch, Gilchrist leaves to a rousing ovation, he Jayasuriya to Ponting, 1 leg bye Jayasuriya bowls it quick into Ponting's pads, he tries to flick but misses, Jayasuriya appeals for lbw but it was missing leg Malinga to Ponting, SIX runs awesome strike, that's not as full as the others, Ponting uses the length to free his arms, he lofts that effortlessly over midwicket for six, outstanding timing Fernando to Ponting, 1 wide poor ball, full toss down leg side, wide called but he's lucky that Ponting didn't put that away Malinga to Watson, OUT bowled him! Shane Watson moves across and tries to play a cheeky paddle sweep over short fine leg, he played it extremely well against New Zealand, but Malinga is too quick for him, Watson doesn't make contact and the ball hits middle and leg stump Fernando to Clarke, 1 wide Fernando bowls a slower bouncer, Clarke is beaten by the change of pace but the umpire signals wide because that was too high, that's pretty harsh Bracken to Upul Tharanga, OUT That's more swing, and that's all over. Short of a length and Tharanga doesn't know whether to go forward or back. Stands rooted to the crease and simply pushes his bat limply, the edge is taken and Gilchrist snaps up a regulation catch behind the stumps. That's the first wicket for Australia and it was all to do with the length. Bracken strikes. Tait to Sangakkara, 1 wide down the leg side, firing it down the pads and it's called wide Watson to Jayasuriya, 1 wide Watson responds in the way I would have done. Goes for a yorker and ends up a wide outside off. Shocker. I am happy even the international bowlers do it. McGrath to Sangakkara, SIX runs Sangakkara's best shot of the tournament. Charges down the track like a marauder and smokes a back of length delivery over deep midwicket. Bracken to Sangakkara, 3 wide slips down the leg side, Sangakkara shuffles across, tries to tickle it away but misses. So does Gilchrist and it's three wides Watson to Silva, 2 wide a pretty wide down leg, the batsman swivels round to give game chase, but Bucknor correctly calls it Clarke to Silva, SIX runs top shot, really very good indeed. A half-tracker that just hits a squidgy part of the track and sits up innocently, only to be hooked with consummate timing, flat, over midwicket Clarke to Malinga, SIX runs now that's a big one. Malinga's got a great eye, dancing and leaning into that one to sail it over long-on with an admirable aerial drive All shake hands with McGrath as he heads off with a stump. He really deserved to go out on a high, and while he has in that he finishes with a winner's medal, the end has been so unsatisfactory. Australia acknowledge their supporters on a lap of honour as the lights from the stands dazzle out into the night. 6.40pm It's really a sad finish for the Caribbean. We have dancers who have been rehearsing for ages for the post-match celebrations out in the middle around the podium, but nobody can see them as it is now night. Clearly, nobody stopped to consider that the game might not finish on time. Meanwhile, Australia are lapping up the acclaim of their supporters, as well they might. Well, that's about it. Much will be written about the tournament in the coming days but for now from the whole Cricinfo commentary team, it's goodnight and thank you for staying with us over the last seven weeks. Australia have won the World Cup for the third time in a row. Will they make it four in four in Asia in 2011?

But that, sadly, is not what the final of the ICC World Cup West Indies 2007 (to give it its full and fully deserved title) will be remembered for. In a display of cack-handedness that heaped new levels of farce upon a farcical seven weeks, the final overs of a broken contest were played out in near-darkness, penetrated only by the glow of the pavilion lights and the bewildered blinking of 20,000 flash bulbs. Whatever went on in those overs is anyone's guess. It was too dark for the fielders to see anything, let alone any of the fans in the stadium or the press in the gantry, and besides, the Australians had already celebrated their moment of victory."
"Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide another wide down off. By George! Hogg can't believe that one - not sure why, it was very wide Hogg to Pollock, OUT awkward shot, checking his off-drive and that's chipped back to the bowler whose clasping fingers accept that fly-trap-style Tait to Kemp, 1 wide Tait flies into bowl, that lovely rhythm ending in a muscly delivery as ever - but all that effort goes to waste as this one is wide down off Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Watson to Langeveldt, OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt, again giving himself room, is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Pollock to open (the bowling. Obviously. He hasn't defected to Australia). Blustery out there which could help him. Let's face it; South Africa need all the assistance they can get Kallis to Hayden, 1 wide good bounce from Kallis but, oh dear, it's very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not-so-wide umpire Kallis to Clarke, 1 leg bye drifting down Clarke's leg side and he works it off his pads Australia win by seven wickets The South Africans acknowledge the support they have received and then head off to lick their wounds, the Australians amble onto the outfield and start a lap of honour. That's all from Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Martin Williamson. Many thanks for staying with us through a one-sided match and we will be back, along with Sriram Veera and Jamie Alter, for Saturday's final. It's almost all over ... Australia won by 7 wickets (with 111 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn McGrath, AUS","Australia 153 for 3 (Clarke 60*, Hayden 41) beat South Africa 149 (Kemp 49*, Tait 4-39, McGrath 3-18) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out History suggested it would be a close encounter, possibly even a classic, but in the end the second semi-final turned into a cakewalk for Australia as they cruised into their fourth successive World Cup decider. Their potent pace attack tore out South Africa's first five wickets inside ten overs and there was no way back. Shaun Tait, who earned a career-best 4 for 39, formed a lethal combination with Glenn McGrath and the Australia batsmen knocked off the target inside 32 overs. South Africa's campaign has lurched from one extreme to the other and their latest performance did nothing to quell Australia's thoughts of a psychological hold. The approach from South Africa hinted at a side that was too pumped up and aware of the need to take the match to Australia."
"Styris to Clarke, 1 wide slips down the leg side. Franklin to Clarke, OUT OMG! Clarke shoulders arms and hey presto! the middle stump has gone for a walk. Unbelievable! Comedy of errors. It was a slower one, on the middle, Clarke backed away, raised his bat and then was indecisive what to with the delivery. He just let th Franklin to Symonds, 1 wide loses control at the point of delivery, sends a full toss way outside off stump, Symonds can't reach it and McCullum, standing up to the stumps, gathers Patel to Symonds, OUT Done in the flight and Mason gets under a swirling delivery at long off. Tossed-up and Symonds charged out but it dipped outside off stump and Symonds reached out and ended up scooping it out high. It swirled as it came down, Mason went left and left, Gillespie to Hussey, 1 leg bye length-delivery, angling in on the middle and leg, tries to lap it away, and it rolls of the pad Gillespie to Watson, SIX runs Leading edge to six over long on. Hmm... Gillespie went round the stumps, bowled one fullish, on leg and middle, Watson tried to loft it over wide midwicket, got a leading edge and it flew over the ropes. Franklin to Hussey, OUT Fools Hussey with a slower one. From over the wicket, full and outside off, Hussey went down his knee and tried to swing it across the line, got a top edge to square-leg. Franklin to Watson, SIX runs Up .. up and over long on. Full, from round the stumps, right in the slot and Watson knives through the line. In the record chase in Hamilton New Zealand hunted down 346. Today they have to beat that. 349 to win. Can they? The wicket has got a bit slower. Join us in a while to find out. Tait to Fleming, OUT gets him with a bouncer. Fleming is not happy. Banged in short, on the middle and off, Fleming tries to pull off the front foot, the ball bounces more than he anticipated, and thudded into his left arm before bobbing away to Ponting at second slip. They Bracken to Styris, 1 wide way outside the off stump, left alone Tait to McMillan, OUT nailed 'em. Full length ball pitching on off and rattling McMillan's pads. It strikes him on middle and, despite Tait delivering from a wide angle, it would have gone on to hit leg stump. Asad Rauf waits for the long appeal to subside before lifting t Watson to Franklin, OUT done by the change of pace. Around 111k slower one, full and outside off, Franklin goes for a drive, is early into the stroke, gets a inside-edge and drags on to the stumps. Five down and boy are they wobbling or what?

AFP Matthew Hayden's third hundred of the competition, the hundredth case of a century in World Cups, was at the heart of a power-packed Australian batting performance during a thumping 215-run triumph against New Zealand in Grenada. Australia, clearly the best team in the tournament, are now two steps away from claiming a hat-trick of World Cups and will travel to St Lucia to take on South Africa in the second semi-final on Wednesday. It was a dominant, almost vengeful, Australian effort, one which would have helped erase the painful memories of the 3-0 whitewash in the recent Chappell-Hadlee series. Hayden shone the brightest but Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson chipped in with valuable fifties - the first a bustling knock at the top, the second a blitzer at the end. New Zealand were without Shane Bond and Jacob Oram, who were out with injury and illness, but this turned into a nightmare of sorts, ending in their worst defeat in one-day history."

Quick, too bouncy for Arnold, who stands rooted and gets cramped on the swipe, all tangled up, and the result is an inside-edge back onto the stumps Bracken to Kulasekara, OUT edged and gone! Bracken maintains his probing, moving line outside off stump, shaping one across Kulasekara to drive on the up, and the thick edge is snapped up very well by Hayden at a deep lone slip, down near his ankles, his second beauty of the day Hogg to Silva, OUT goddim! Tossed up on middle and leg, now he prefers the more orthodox sweep, but mistimes it and the top-edge is easily gobbled up by Clarke at short fine leg, success for Hogg Clarke to Bandara, 1 leg bye quicker, flatter, spinning down leg stump, Bandara sweeps, misses, and scampers a leg bye to the off side Hogg to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT well bowled, well stumped!

AFP A couple of Sri Lanka batting collapses turned a potentially cracking contest into a one-sided affair, as Australia wrapped up a comprehensive seven-wicket win. The move to rest Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan weakened Sri Lanka's bowling but it was the unchanged batting line up that faltered on a true surface in Grenada. Australia were clinical, seizing the openings without fail and stamping their authority when it counted. They lost the toss but made full use of the early swing before witnessing a well-crafted 140-run stand between Mahela Jayawardene and Chamara Silva for the fourth wicket.

An excellent slower ball which he misread, spooning it over McGrath's head Clark to K O'Brien, OUT drifting onto his pads and timed beautifully, with an elegant flick of his wrists, but he picks out Hodge at short midwicket who didn't need move an inch, taking the ball at head height Tait to McCallan, 1 wide an ugly, short, wide, lifting delivery which is easily left alone Tait to Johnston, 1 wide rubbish. Short, wide and wided by the umpire Tait to Johnston, OUT but he's got him this time. Clever bowling from Tait, sending it just a touch wider and enticing the drive. Johnston goes for an expansive slap through the covers, but instead the ball slaps into his stumps Symonds to McCallan, OUT gone this time. McCallan was getting fed up with all this poking and prodding Hogg to D Langford-Smith, OUT Dave's gone! Stepping back, not picking it at all, he tries to defend but it takes the outside edge, ballooning to Ricky Ponting at silly point Hogg to Rankin, 1 wide drifting down the leg side Clark to K O'Brien, 1 wide Clarke continues where his team-mate left off with a leg-side wide Hogg to Mooney, OUT driven to mid-off and Tait shies down the stumps on the bounce Mooney to Symonds, SIX runs a Symonds special. Steps down the track and just lifts a half-volley straight and over the boundary boards Johnston to Hussey, 1 wide wide down off and that's left alone Well, that was sadly predictable. But, my, Australia said they were going all out for the win, and they didn't make any mistake in doing so. They may have tinkered with their batting order, but sending Hussey and Symonds for some practice proved a goo Australia won by 9 wickets (with 226 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn McGrath, AUS","Australia 92 for 1 (Gilchrist 34, Hussey 30*) beat Ireland 91 (McGrath 3-17, Tait 3-39) Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out - Ireland How they were out - Australia Shaun Tait blew through Ireland's top order with three wickets ? Getty Images With the ruthlessness that everyone has come to expect from the Australians, they overwhelmed Ireland by nine wickets at Bridgetown after demolishing them for 91. The pace and bounce of Glenn McGrath and Shaun Tait proved too much for the Irish top order, as they removed the top four inside five overs, and only three batsmen reached double figures. The result confirms Australia as the first team in the semi-finals. Australia could have decided to use this match to hone their all-round game: have a bat, rack up 300-plus then bowl when the track was slower. But they are a team with one focus: winning as quickly and effectively as possible."
"England win the toss and bat first. Well done them. No news of Australia's team yet. The big winners are keeping it close to their chests. Ah, here they are. Well it's what we expected really. Just Brad Hodge coming in for the when-will-he-ever-not-be-injured Shane Watson. Tait to Bell, 1 leg bye a Tait slingshot down the leg side - almost Malinga-like there - and it wibbles off Bell's pad down to fine leg Tait to Vaughan, OUT gone! Again short from Tait, Vaughan went back and simply played it onto his stumps. Tait to Strauss, 1 wide another bouncer - and, rejoice, it's wided by the umpire. Tait to Strauss, 1 wide the first genuinely filthy wide from Tait and Gilchrist, well - he does brilliantly to save four (or rather, five), diving to his right Tait to Strauss, OUT gone! A mirror of Vaughan's dismissal Bracken to Bell, 1 wide down the leg side, Gilchrist takes it brilliantly but can't save Rudi calling it a wide McGrath to Bell, OUT oh there we go, Bell departs - McGrath perhaps held it back a touch, Bell trying to drive it over cover but his head fell back and the ball spooned to Hussey at extra cover Tait to PD Collingwood, OUT lovely delivery, top class that one: Collingwood looking for the reverse swing and playing away from his body on his back foot. There's just a thin edge - but one without doubt - and Gilchrist clings on Tait to Flintoff, 1 wide strays that one down leg, Tait immediately turns to look at Rudi Koertzen, expecting a wide... the umpire thinks about it, and then makes the sign Hogg to Flintoff, OUT a little touch of air and the ball tempts him outside his crease. It deviates past his outside edge, turning a touch and Gilchrist completes the move with some sharp glovework and Flintoff's on his way Hogg to Pietersen, 2 wide goes for the sweep, misses Bracken to Bopara, OUT what a shot, but he's found Hussey at deep midwicket. It was an extraordinary flick, timing it to Hussey on the boundary who took an easy catch Tait to Bopara, 1 leg bye and again, that's got to be out! No, again Rudi turns it down - again a magnificently vehement appeal from the bowler but, again, it's just sliding down leg Bracken to Pietersen, OUT and he's gone this time, trying to lift Bracken for six but it's hit flat, and straight to Michael Clarke who needs not move a muscle, taking a very simple catch Bracken to Mahmood, OUT another full toss, well, what a catch! That's a marvellous catch from Hodge, Mahmood slicing it to him at backward point who tumbled to his right and took a fine catch McGrath to Nixon, OUT and he tries to replicate the shot before, smacking a full toss but straight down Hodge's throat at long-on who swallows it with ease McGrath to Anderson, OUT full, swinging into Anderson who completely misreads the line. McGrath roars his appeal and up goes the finger 1.45pm Welcome back. Here come Gilchrist and Hayden, needing five an over, which should be comfortable on this track. Andrew Miller reckons 247 is a winning total. Let's find out shall we? It'll be James Anderson to take the new ball, a cricket ball, and not the beach ball that's blown onto the pitch. Here we go Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide great delivery to a righthander... unfortunately Hayden isn't, and that one slinks down leg, on a good length, but wide enough to be called so Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide comes down the track, tries to hook, and misses it completely - the ball strayghing down leg Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide leg-side filth Mahmood to Ponting, 1 wide down the leg side and that'll be a wide Flintoff to Clarke, 1 leg bye have some of that, umpire, Flintoff asks. But the umpire's had more than enough of it, and it's not out - drifting down leg by some distance Flintoff to Symonds, 1 leg bye caressed off the hips, literally, behind square Well played Australia, they deserved that victory - good captaincy from Ponting to apply the squeeze once Pietersen and Bell had got them into a decent position in England's innings. Another victory for Australia, then, the deserved favourites, and that's 18 straight World Cup wins for them. Take that. England, meanw Australia won by 7 wickets (with 16 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shaun Tait, AUS","Australia 248 for 3 (Ponting 86, Clarke 55*) beat England 247 (Pietersen 104, Bell 77) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out - England How they were out - Australia Ricky Ponting led from the front with the bat and in the field ? Getty Images Ricky Ponting's 86 was the major feature for Australia as they completed a seven-wicket win against England in Antigua with 16 balls to spare. The result virtually assured them of a semi-final berth and left their rivals clinging on by their fingernails. Kevin Pietersen's fourth ODI ton, like his other three, came in a losing cause, with Australia's three frontline pacemen responding to Ponting's clever captaincy as the innings fell away dramatically. While Pietersen and Bell were adding 140 in 23 overs Australia were being challenged for the first time since South Africa's opening stand in St Kitts. Like they did on that occasion, they passed the test with flying colours."
"Lee to Jayasuriya, OUT he's gone this time, and that was another cracker - fuller, faster and angling back into the left-hander. No room to play any shot whatsoever, and up goes the finger! Bracken to Upul Tharanga, OUT that dismissal was somewhat telegraphed. He was dancing around at the crease and, in attempting to whip to leg, found only a leading edge. Brett Lee at deep point swallows a looping chance, and Sri Lanka are in deep trouble now Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT oh dear, this is carnage. Jayawardene was in no position for that stroke - a wristy whip through midwicket that turned into a looping chance for Stuart Clark at mid-on. He did well to dive forward and scoop it off the turf, but a very loose shot from Sri Lanka's captain Johnson to Silva, 1 wide not such a good ball. Pitches outside leg and stays that way Clark to Silva, OUT he frees his arms this time, but to absolutely no avail - a massive windmill of a wind-up, but a ball that was intended to vanish over the covers instead spirals down to Brett Lee on the third man boundary. Credit to Clark, he built the pressure and Silva cracked Clark to Dilshan, OUT that wasn't very clever. Dilshan tries to improvise, he steps outside off and tries to sweep off a good length, but instead pats a simple chance straight into Gilchrist's gloves as he hops to the leg-side. Another one bites the dust, and with the exception of Jayasuriya, they've all been tame dismissals Symonds to Vaas, OUT a big - but ultimately ineffectual - swing, Vaas down the track and picks out Lee at deep midwicket, five yards in from the rope, who does well stretching out to his right Bracken to Fernando, OUT a poor shot - indicative of Sri Lanka's day - to finish. A slower ball from Bracken, and the batsman pops up a bottom edge back towards the bowler who has a second to think about before taking confidently Fernando to Hayden, 1 leg bye somehow, the leg-stump line is proving very effective in this over. This time, backward square can't stop the single Maharoof to Hayden, 5 wide hopeless delivery, short and utterly misdirected. Sangakkara had no chance of cutting that off as it fizzed down the leg side ""Our fielders and our bowlers were outstanding. To chase on that wicket ... it's getting really tired and it would have been difficult. Our bowlers definitely won that match for us."" So, that's that. Australia wrap up a ten-wicket victory with almost half of their overs to spare, and it is they who march on to the semi-finals where they will be joined by Pakistan, South Africa (barring miracles) and either New Zealand or India. Australia won by 10 wickets (with 58 balls remaining) Player of the match is Stuart Clark, AUS","Australia 102 for 0 (Hayden 58*, Gilchrist 31* ) beat Sri Lanka 101 (Clark 4-20) by ten wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The rot starts here ... Brett Lee strikes to remove Sanath Jayasuriya with the third ball ? Getty Images A match billed as a winner-takes-all contest was as good as decided before latecomers had even taken their seats at Newlands. In that time Australia blew away Sri Lanka's top order, and though they made a recovery of sorts to reach 101, it was a dismal performance and Australia strolled to a ten-wicket win with almost half their overs intact."
"13.40: Toss: News from the middle is that Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. Lee to Tamim, 1 wide Tamim backs away to whack that over the off side, Lee senses it and thuds it in short, the ball sails over Tamim's head, wide called Lee to Nazimuddin, (no ball) strives for that extra yard of pace and oversteps, the ball climbs off a good length outside off, Nazim leaves it Johnson to Nazimuddin, 1 leg bye bouncer, Nazimuddin goes for the hook, the ball hits the helmet and lobs to point Johnson to Nazimuddin, OUT good reflexes, driven hard to cover, Ponting gets a hand to it, fumbles and in the second attempt takes the catch, all over in a flash Clarke to Tamim, 3 wide down leg side, Tamim sweeps, the ball misses the bat and another wide Lee to Shakib, OUT caught! Shakib backs away and tries to cut but Lee follows him and cramps him for room with a short of a length ball, Shakib gets a thick edge that is taken by Gilchrist Lee to Mortaza, OUT bowled first ball! Lee fires in the yorker on off stump, Mortaza backs away trying to hit on the off side and is clean bowled Lee to Kapali, OUT he's got him! Lee's angles the ball from a good length into Alok Kapali who moves across his stumps and tries to play through midwicket, he gets hit flush on the pad and Asad Rauf raises the finger, awesome stuff from Lee Clarke to Tamim, OUT caught! Tamim gives Clarke the charge and tries to loft him down the ground, he slices it high in the air and Ricky Ponting settles under the catch at cover and judges it to perfection Bracken to Aftab, OUT caught! Aftab gives Bracken the charge and tries to slog him over midwicket, there's no pace on the ball from Bracken and Aftab skies it in the air to Brad Hodge who takes a well-judged catch looking straight into the sun Bracken to Farhad, OUT Reza slogs Bracken high in the air down to long-on where Michael Hussey takes a superb catch just inside the boundary, he looks back to see where his back foot is, it is just inside the boundary Stats - When Gilchrist caught Shakib Al Hasan, he equalled Mushfiqur Rahim's record for the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper, eight. After their wham-bam approach against South Africa yesterday, the Bangladesh innings has been a complete anti-climax. They shelved their natural instincts at the start and never gained any momentum. They had plenty of wickets to make a late charge but Lee's hat-trick, the first in Twenty20 internationals, put paid Gilchrist and Hayden walk out. Bangladesh will have to field out of their skins to defend this total. Mashrafe Mortaza to open Syed Rasel to Hayden, 1 wide wide outside off, hayden has a wild swing, misses it Syed Rasel to Hayden, SIX runs good length on off stump, Hayden has all the time in the world to get in position to swing across the line and cart it over cow corner on the on side Shakib to Gilchrist, SIX runs flighted on middle and off, advances down the track and lofts over the bowler's head, goes a few rows back Razzak to Gilchrist, SIX runs Gilchrist charges down the track and lofts the ball cleanly over the head of the fielder at long-off, that's his fourth six The game was over as a contest after the Australians restricted Bangladesh to 123. Brett Lee became the first bowler to take a Twenty20 hat-trick and all the other bowlers bowled a superb line and length to keep Bangladesh on a leash. Bangladesh's batsmen were very disappointing after their break-neck start agains Australia won by 9 wickets (with 37 balls remaining) Player of the match is Brett Lee, AUS","Australia 124 for 1 (Hayden 73*, Gilchrist 43) beat Bangladesh 123 for 8 (Lee 3-27) by 9 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out True to form: Mathew Hayden bullied Bangladesh with a belligerent 73 not out ? Getty Images It was swift and clinical. Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals as Australia's fast bowlers hit a persistent short-of-length to set the game up and restrict Bangladesh to 123, before Mathew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist easily powered Australia to a nine-wicket win. Bangladesh had detonated the West Indies and South African new-ball attacks but that was because they were offered a fuller length that allowed them to blast through the line. Australia recognised it and didn't offer much on the fuller side today. The idea was to put the ball in the right place, as Lee emphasised at the end of the match."
"Bracken to Prior, SIX runs a skip down the pitch and Prior smashes that for six over extra cover ... a shimmy to leg as well and that flew Johnson to Prior, OUT a charge too far, Prior gets cramped as Johnson follows him and the ball, which hit high up on the bat, hangs for a long time before falling to Bracken at wide mid-on Johnson to Wright, OUT Johnson swings it across Wright who slogs and gets a thick outside edge, Gilchrist does the rest Clark to Maddy, OUT driven high and straight but Maddy deceived by the slower ball ... no power in the shot and deepish mid-off takes a routine catch Bracken to Shah, OUT wheels are coming off - Shah holes out now, this time to a sanother slow delivery over in front of deep midwicket Lee to PD Collingwood, OUT low full toss, on off, and a huge wicket, Collingwood trapped low and there wasn't much deliberating needed to give that one out Clark to Schofield, OUT great catch, Gilchrist dives to his left - and seems to be suspended there - making great ground to hold the thick edge with one outstretched glove Clark to Broad, OUT unfortunate dismissal in some ways... Mascarenhas charging down the track in backing up and Broad's straight drive takes a nick from Clark's down-pointing fingers Bracken to Broad, OUT and that's that, Broad cleaned up going for a huge one, driving an inside edge back on to the stumps Thanks for joining us today.

Australia won by 8 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) Player of the match is Nathan Bracken, AUS","Australia 136 for 2 (Hayden 67*) beat England 135 (Flintoff 31, Bracken 3-16) by eight wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Matt Hayden: unstoppable at the top of Australia's innings ? Getty Images Australia bounced back in style from Wednesday night's humiliation against Zimbabwe, producing a performance with bat and ball that was as disciplined and purposeful as their earlier efforts had been flaccid and complacent. After losing the toss and being asked to bowl first, they stifled England's attacking intent to bowl them out for 135, then raced to an eight-wicket victory with more than a quarter of the overs remaining, thanks largely to an unbeaten 67 from 43 balls from Matthew Hayden. The cause of England's downfall was a muddled performance from their batsman, who seemed more distracted by Australia's pre-match predicament than the Aussies themselves. Though Kevin Pietersen had talked in gleeful terms of ""humiliating"" their oldest rivals and sending them home early, none of his team-mates were able to back up the big words with deeds. Pietersen bristled during a 20-ball cameo but yorked himself when well set on 21, Collingwood clobbered 18 quick runs then missed a low full-toss, and by the time the last five wickets had tumbled for eight runs, Andrew Flintoff's 31 from 19 balls was as good as England could offer."
"Murali to Hussey, SIX runs now then, thrown up outside off and Hussey brings out the slog sweep, on his knees and lofts it way over midwicket for a maximum, as crisp as it gets, catch goes down in the bounda Fernando to Hussey, OUT Now where did that come from! 135kph, superb inswinging yorker from Fernando and it crashes into Hussey's front toe. He tries to dig it out but can't make allowance for the swing. Big Murali to Symonds, SIX runs of course he should. Flighted from Murali and he's down the track in a flash, carting the ball way over the bowler's head for a biggie, massive hit that. He's in a hurry today Roy Malinga to Clarke, OUT strangled down leg side! It was short in length, moving down the leg side, Clarke tries to glance it but gets a glove to it and the 'keeper dives acrobatically to his left to take a fa Malinga to Symonds, 1 leg bye huge shout for lbw but missing leg. Only just. It was full, swinging in late but it started from middle and leg and struck Symonds in front of the leg. Johnson to Sangakkara, OUT got 'em, poor shot that time, short of a length and outside off, cracked it airily through to point where Hussey is prowling eagerly, straight to him and it's taken easy, poor shot- MacGill to Jayasuriya, OUT Oh what a moment, straight ball, quicker this time and would you believe it, Jayasuriya tries to sweep it, not the ball you'd want to sweep given that it's full and quick, he misses MacGill to Silva, OUT that's the sucker punch from MacGill, legbreak starting from middle and off and spinning away, slightly short, Silva rocks back to cut but can only get a top edge, Gilchrist completes a Clark to HAPW, OUT what a beauty! outstanding seam bowling, Glenn McGrath must be smiling, probing outside off, just a bit of seam movement, enough to take the edge and that sails through to the keeper, he de Clark to Maharoof, 1 leg bye on the pads, turned away towards short fine leg MacGill to Maharoof, OUT Now that's as reckless as it gets. Smashed down the ground, MacGill gets a hand to it as it deflects onto the stumps, Mahela is back in the crease, but that's where the confusion star Clark to Malinga, OUT And he does the job straight away, good-length ball that's on middle, moves away just a shade and knocks back middle and off stump, Malinga had no clue, some top-order batsmen might have Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT that's spooned straight to Clarke at deep square leg, good-length ball, Mahela picks it off but it's straight to Clarke, who doesn't have to move at deep square leg. Fine inning Now, interestingly Matthew Hayden dashed off towards the dressing room, suggesting that Australia will bat again. Ponting has decided not to enforce the follow on. Interesting decision.

Getty Images Kumar Sangakkara's 192 was the big difference between the scripts in Brisbane and Hobart but Sri Lanka were denied a fairytale ending as Brett Lee grabbed four wickets and Australia secured a 2-0 series victory with their 14th consecutive Test win. Despite a collapse early in the morning when Sri Lanka lost 5 for 25, Sangakkara gave Australia a few nervous moments with an audacious assault that only ended with an unfortunate umpiring call shortly before lunch. It is hard to predict how close Sri Lanka would have come to the record 507 they needed to win had Sangakkara stayed at the crease, but the way he was playing he just might have got them home. He could have given up once Lee and Mitchell Johnson sparked the early crashes but instead Sangakkara simply altered his game plan and formed a 74-run stand with Lasith Malinga. Sadly for the visitors Sangakkara was denied his third double-century for 2007 when he tried to hook Stuart Clark and the ball flew off his shoulder to Ricky Ponting at slip."

Getty Images Brett Lee helped Australia beat not only Sri Lanka but also the unpredictable Brisbane weather as the hosts rattled out the last five wickets between rain breaks on the final day. Lee claimed 4 for 86 to confirm Australia's 1-0 lead ahead of the second Test in the two-match series, which starts in Hobart on Friday. Australia won their first Test of the post-Warne, McGrath and Langer era by an innings and 40 runs and it was fitting that Lee, the attack's new spearhead, was the leading trouble-maker and the Man of the Match. Pleasingly for Australia, he was also building on the work of their new opener, Phil Jaques, who made 100, while another fresh face, Mitchell Johnson, chipped in with two wickets in each innings. After Michael Vandort induced a slight hiccup from Australia on the fourth day, Lee made sure the plan came back on track on the final morning despite Chamara Silva's 43."

Getty Images Jacob Oram gave Australia some serious jitters but they successfully defended their huge 5 for 343 that was set up by punishing Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting centuries. Twice in the past 13 months Australia lost games after scoring more than 330, but despite Oram's brilliant unbeaten century, which was interrupted by a half-hour rain delay with eight overs left, they recorded an eight-run success. Oram smashed six sixes in a 71-ball hundred, the fastest by a New Zealander, and he combined with Brendon McCullum in a 137-run stand at more than a run-and-a-half a ball. While they were always behind, the batsmen produced enough fireworks to spark a batch of local nerves. When Lou Vincent and Craig McMillan fell within eight runs of each other near the middle of the innings the target was quickly becoming out of reach, but Oram refused to believe it was over."
"Toss: England have won the toss and will bat Lee to Loye, OUT and he's gone now! wide ball outside off stump, Loye would have been better of letting that go but he went hard at it and the slash resulted in a thick outside edge that flew straight to Gilchrist Johnson to Strauss, OUT gone! that was too close to cut to third man and Strauss went for it anyway and got a thick edge to Gilchrist, Strauss has been playing that shot repeatedly today and a nick was always on the cards Lee to Joyce, OUT it wasn't short enough to pull and the line was outside off stump, Joyce tried to force it through midwicket and ended up getting a top edge to Mitchell Johnson at mid-on who took a comfortable catch, a very rash shot and England are slipping as they have done in previous matches in this series Johnson to Dalrymple, OUT Johnson strikes again! two in two overs and England's slump continues. Perfect line and length to the right-hander - good length, pitched close to the off stump line and shaping in late. Dalrymple had to play at it and the edge goes straight to Gilchrist behind the stumps. Johnson to Plunkett, OUT that's the end of that! Johnson once again drags it short and Plunkett plays the 'sitting duck act' to perfection, ball clips the shoulder of the bat and lobs up towards point. Clarke moves in quickly and makes no mistake. As simple as that Hogg to Tremlett, OUT another one bites the dust and this time it's the googly that does the damage. Flat and on the middle and off stump line, turning away evers-so-slightly. Tremlett pushes forward to defend and the edge is produced.

Hogg shuffles across and makes no mistake. Done and dusted in 34.3 overs This is the lowest total at Adelaide Oval since March 1992 - Well done England. Once again there is nothing to write home about, There was no intent from England's batsmen and they threw away their wickets with loose shots. Australian bowler's cashed in heavily and 111 is what they need to get when they come out to bat.

Getty Images England have spluttered to so many deflating losses on this tour that even rabid and patriotic Australian supporters have started pleading for them to lift off the bottom. After today's nine-wicket caning in a match lasting only 59 overs the same thought stands. Please can this be the turning point? There is still time for England repairs - the CB Series has just passed the halfway point and, amazingly, they could reach the finals easily - but on this performance they would have been lucky to have achieved anything positive in the World Cup warm-up for the minnows in Kenya. Throughout the tour Andrew Flintoff has spoken proudly about the strong spirit in the dressing room, but his men have been unable to transform the talk and have slumped horribly since a brief change of direction against New Zealand in Hobart. For some reason Adelaide, the most beautiful of grounds, turns England into their ugliest."
"Toss: New Zealand have won the toss and will bat. I'll have the team news shortly ... Lee to Astle, OUT caught! Lee pitched that short of a length and outside off stump, Astle waited for it and tried to cut it, his feet didn't move at all and he ended up getting a huge nick through to Gilchrist, Lee deserved a wicket, he's been outstanding today Lee to Marshall, OUT Lee has another one, brilliant pace bowling, Lee pitches it on a perfect length and seams it away from the right hander off the pitch, Marhsall plays back and pokes at it, the ball kisses the outside edge and Gilchrist does the rest Lee to Taylor, 4 leg byes four leg-byes, Lee banged that short and into Taylor's body, he moved across in a hurry and tried to fend it down, the ball beat him and thudded into the thigh pad and flew wide off Gilchrist for four Clark to Fleming, OUT He strikes first ball! Good length outside off stump, Fleming tries to loft it over the off side, he was not to the pitch of the ball and he hit it high on the bat to Hussey at mid-off, who takes an easy catch Clark to Taylor, OUT Clark gets another! Pitches short of a length on off stump, Taylor throws his bat at it and tries to heave it down the ground, he gets a lot of height on it but not the distance, Hussey back-pedals from mid-off and takes a well-judged catch Clark to McMillan, SIX runs what a shot, audacity at its best! McMillan charges down the track to a short ball and flat bats it high and handsomely over the long off boundary Lee to McMillan, 1 wide banged in very short outside off stump, McMillan swerves out of the way, wide called Clark to Fulton, OUT Gotcha! Fulton perishes. Short of length, outside the off stumpm it goes straight on and Fulton plays a nothing shot, a lame push and steers it straight to Hayden at first slip. Symonds to McMillan, 1 wide strays down leg side, wide called McGrath to McCullum, OUT and he's successful with his first ball! that pitched short of alength just outside off stump, McCullum moved across his stumps and got hit on the pads, the Australians go up in appeal and the umpire agrees, that might have struck him marginally outside the line of off stump McGrath to Franklin, OUT short ball yet again and this time Franklin connects with the pull, he pulls it straight to Matthew Hayden at deep midwicket, Hayden hardly had to move and took an easy catch McGrath to McMillan, OUT that's the end of a pugnacious innings! McGrath bowls a full toss, McMillan tries to hoick it down the ground and skies it back to the bowler, McGrath takes a simple catch, there's a bit of confusion as to whether the full toss was above waist height, McMillan hangs around for a bit but has to go in the end Bracken to Mason, OUT that's the end of that, Bracken bowls the effort ball, just a bit quicker and in the blockhole, Mason plays all around it and has his stumps re-arranged, New Zealand are bowled out for 218 Australia have done well to dismiss New Zealand for 218 after losing the toss. McGrath was impeccable with figures of 3 for 24 off his ten overs. Clark was more expensive but he did pick up four important wickets. McMillan led the way for New Zealand with 89 off 87 balls and it was his effort that took New Zealand to a score they can hope to defend if they bowl well.

Getty Images Michael Hussey again finished a difficult job for his team, taking Australia to victory against New Zealand with two wickets to spare. Hussey's unbeaten 65 was the key in a tight run-chase of 219 and he brought up the win with a six in the 49th over. New Zealand pushed Australia to the very end but their decision to play only four bowlers cost them dearly as Craig McMillan and Nathan Astle proved too easy to score off in the dying overs. McMillan had already done his part with 89 in New Zealand's 219 but Hussey and Michael Clarke (75) earned Australia their fourth win of the series. Clarke's dismissal in the 38th over triggered a mini-collapse as Cameron White and Brett Lee fell soon after and when Nathan Bracken was caught with two runs required the outcome was still uncertain."
"McGrath to Strauss, OUT Hodge you beauty! short of a good length delivery on the middle and off stump line, innocuous delivery. Strauss having failed playing the drive and the flick goes for the pull and the ball flies away towards midwicket. Hodge there quickly moves across to his left and pulls off a stunner, diving across to his left. He McGrath to Joyce, OUT and McGrath ends Joyce's uneasy stay at the crease with a beauty! short of a good length delivery, this one hit the deck and shaped back in. Joyce was clueless and in the end it was a nothing poke, ball clipped the inside edge and went straight to Gilchrist behind the stumps. That's the end of that and we are back to s Johnson to Flintoff, 1 wide high bouncer and the umpire is not impressed McGrath to PD Collingwood, OUT and the party continue! short of a good length, pitched right in the channel outside the off stump and shaping away late - special delivery for poor mortals and a McGrath usual. Collingwood had no option but to play at it and the edge went straight to Gilchrist behind the stumps. England five down and they are Lee to Nixon, OUT short of a good length delivery, pitched outside the off stump and angling away. Nixon stays back and pokes at it, playing well away from his body. Thick edge and the ball goes straight to Hayden at first slip who snaffles it as clean as a whistle. England six down. Lee to Flintoff, FOUR runs good length delivery on the middle and off stump line. Flintoff just lines it up nicely and slogs it away to wide long-on. Good clean hit and the ball hits the inside part of the boundary padding. Was signalled as a six but the umpire but then came the camera angles and the third umpire. Lee to Flintoff, OUT Hodge pulls off another blinder and England's slump continues! good length and cutting in. Flintoff slogs it away towards midwicket. Hodge in the deep hurtles across to his left, drives across at the last movement and takes it with both hands. Fantastic bit of fielding. England seven down - just three more to go. Bracken to Lewis, OUT got'm! and once again it's the slower ball that does the trick. Low fulltoss on the middle and off stump line. Lewis jams his bat down, probably he thought it was the yorker. Ball hits the bottom part of the bat and spoons up straight back to the bowler. White to Anderson, 1 wide slips that down leg side. Wide called. White to Anderson, 1 wide googly but again down the leg side White to Dalrymple, OUT There you go. England shot out for 155. The awful summer continues. Short of length, outside the off stump, Dalrymple could have pulled it anywhere but he decides this is the time to end the misery and hits it right at the throat of long on. Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide wide down the leg side. All over the shop. Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide slips down leg side. Anderson to Hodge, OUT Hodge's one-day travails continue. Full and on the middle and leg, it holds its line a touch, Hodge looks to turn it the on side, gets a outer edge and it flies to point where Darlymple takes it right in front of his face. Australia lose their second wicket. No Ricky Ponting today. Under slight pressure Anderson to Clarke, 1 wide a bouncer! Wide called for the height. Too short and it sails harmlessly over Clarke's head. Good intent as Clarke's first movement is to get forward. Lewis to Symonds, (no ball) again that off stump line, pushed out to cover region Lewis to Symonds, OUT Revenge! Lewis sends Symonds packing. Again full and outside off stump line, looked pretty similar to the previous delivery but a tad wider, and Symonds throws his bat at it and gets a thick edge. Nixon goes airborne and takes it in front of first slip. Surely, hopefully for all of you out there desperate for a contest Flintoff to Hussey, 1 leg bye off the pads and the ball rolls away towards square leg, they scamper through for a single Lewis to Clarke, OUT and he strikes! good length and drifting down the leg side, Clarke follows the ball in a effort to clip it down to fine leg but fails to make solid contact. Not sure if there was any wood involved, hard to say from here. The keeper and the bowler were convinced and so was the umpire. That's the wicket they were looking Anderson to White, OUT Anderson strikes back for England and the see-saw battle continues. Good length delivery and this one nipped back in off the deck. White plays across the line and the ball thuds into the pad. Loud shout and on this occasion the umpire adjudicates in favour of the bowler. Flintoff to Hussey, 1 wide This one is way outside off. wide called. He was trying to push it across Hussey but ended up slanting it too wide And that wraps our coverage for the day.

Getty Images A committed bowling display led by John Lewis eased England's pain, but it was not enough to prevent another defeat that was set up by a dire batting effort. After England spluttered to 155 all out in 42 overs on a strange surface, the home team copied the mistakes and dropped to 4 for 48 before sweating to a four-wicket victory. Despite gaining an unlikely position of strength through Lewis's three-wicket opening, England again released the pressure and Michael Hussey responded with a match-sealing 46. Hussey worked with Michael Clarke and Brett Lee, who finished on 20 after surviving a torrid spell from Andrew Flintoff, to steer the side out of trouble. However, they were fortunate to claim a bonus point from an encounter that turned out to be relatively even."
"Toss: Australia have won the toss and elected to bat. Gillespie to Gilchrist, 1 leg bye pitched outside the leg stump, loud appeal, given not out by umpire Rauf, they scamper through for a leg bye Gillespie to Hayden, OUT Gillespie gets the first break-through, it was short and down the leg side, Hayden looking for the pull, gets the edge through to McCullum (off the glove), who takes the catch. Patel to Gilchrist, OUT pitches on the middle and straightens, Gilchrist once again looking for the slog sweep, misses it completely, strikes the pad, loud appeal, umpire Rauf takes a long time and then lifts the finger.

An innocuous half-tracker moving away from him outside off stump, asking to be cut but what does Hussey do? He opens the face and slices that to Hamish Marshall at backward point for a dolly! McMillan gets the breakthrough, and he's cock-a-hoop Vettori to White, 1 leg bye tossed up on middle and off, doesnt spin away much, White tries to sweep and gets rapped in front of middle, they all go up in appeal but Rauf shakes the head, too high probably, and he was very far forward....hmmm....but a damn good shout Bond to White, SIX runs see you later, you beauty! A good length ball outside off stump, White just frees the arms and heaves it superbly over deep midwicket, and it sails miles over the stands, hitting the roof and continuing out of the ground! Thats not coming back any time soon! Bond to White, OUT gone! Bond fires it in full on the stumps and White makes room outside leg stump, looking to slog it away, but can only find McMillan at a deepish midwicket Bond to Symonds, OUT and he gets one more! Bond bowls one on a good length outside off stump, Symonds steps to leg and looks to uppercut, but ends up nibbling it through to McCullum, thats two in two for Bond Bond to Bracken, OUT YES he can! Bond! Short of a lengh on off stump, slower too, and it beats Bracken all ends up, cannoning into off stump, and Bond's ecstatic! Superb stuff, and boy does he love it! Huge smile, eyes twinkling like a kid's in a candy shop, arms outstretched - COME TO ME he almost says as his teammates converge on him So, an exciting, stop-start innings from Australia gets them to a very good total, leaving New Zealand with a lot of hard work to do. 290 is the target for them. Adam Gilchrist set the tone with a typical one-day fifty, Michael Clarke and Andrew Symonds consolidated after a few wickets, and then joined by the energetic Cameron White, Symonds took the bowlers to the cleaners. When it looked It will be McCullum to take strike to Bracken, a slip and short midwicket close in Hilfenhaus to Fleming, 1 wide swings down the leg side, signalled wide Clark to Taylor, 1 leg bye full and on the legs, strikes the pads, loud appeal turned down, as the ball was going down the leg side, they go through with a leg bye Symonds to Taylor, SIX runs Shot! a slog sweep, swings it high and over the midwicket fence for maximum. Wonderful strike that from Taylor, he looks to have pulled his muscle as he went for the shot. Symonds to Taylor, 1 wide down the leg side, signalled wide Johnson to McMillan, 1 wide and he's greeted by a bad ball, very, very full and wide of off stump Hilfenhaus to McMillan, OUT low full toss on off stump, he flicks across the line past midwicket, quickly comes Clarke from the deep, who moves, picks it up and throws it straight onto the nonstriker's end, and gets his man! He didnt have a lot to work with, moving and throwing it on the turn, and looking at one stump, but his brilliance does the rest! McMillan cant believe it, and White to Patel, 1 leg bye spinning down leg stump, Patel shuffles and tries to dab it fine, but leg byes are signalled Australia surge to another victory, having outclassed New Zealand in every facet of today's game. The batting clicked, and the level-headed were able to recover after a brief wobble at the top and get it together in good nick at the tail, especially Cameron White and Andrew Symonds, and despite Shane Bond's hat-trick in the 50th over - he became just the second New Zealand bowler to do so Player of the match is Andrew Symonds, AUS","Australia 8 for 289 (Symonds 69, Gilchrist 61, White 45, Bond 4-61) beat New Zealand 184 (Taylor 84) by 105 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball commentary Shane Bond's last-over hat-trick gave New Zealand a chance ? Getty Images New Zealand's batsmen were unable to follow up on Shane Bond's hat-trick and fell 105 runs short of Australia's 289 despite Ross Taylor's fighting 84. The visitors lost their final seven wickets for 23 in a disappointing finish after Bond made a memorable impact to close the first innings. Andrew Symonds and Cameron White launched a late onslaught of 90 in nine overs before Bond ended the partnership in the 50th over when White was caught in the deep and Symonds edged behind next ball attempting a huge drive. Bond, who became the second New Zealander to take a one-day international hat-trick and collected 4 for 61, finished the job with a ripper that took the top of Nathan Bracken's off stump, but his team-mates failed to carry the momentum into their batting. Taylor, who came in at 2 for 7 in the fourth over, showed the 128 he made in his third ODI last month was no fluke and he was the only batsman to threaten Australia."

Flintoff not pitching anything up but struggling for his line Anderson to Hayden, OUT Hayden onto the front foot as everything Anderson has bowled so far has been pitched up, but this one isn't and his slash comes off the splice and loops to Dalrymple at mid-off Lewis to Gilchrist, SIX runs Oh yes! Gilchrist onto one knee and he smashes the ball over deep midwicket and it ends up halfway up the Bill O'Reilly stand Panesar to Gilchrist, OUT Gilchrist shapes to pepper the Bill O'Reilly stand again but gets an inside edge into his off stump Panesar to Hussey, OUT Hussey comes right down the track looking for the same shot this time - the crack over midwicket - and his stumps are taken by Nixon, with some sharp work PD Collingwood to Ponting, OUT down on one knee and tries to flick that high over square leg where Lewis makes no mistake this time, having dropped him on 16. Lewis shows the ball to the crowd... because he can Lewis to Clarke, OUT short, just outside off and that's some sharp work in close from Collingwood, winged right back in over the stumps and Nixon who does the rest. Mix up of the yes, no, wait, sorry variety Lewis to White, SIX runs whack! Lovely shot in front of midwicket and that's just inches over the boundary PD Collingwood to Symonds, 1 leg bye slower ball, strays down leg and Symonds can only get a leg on it as it goes to the man up at fine leg PD Collingwood to White, SIX runs clattered over midwicket and Dalrymple has a one-handed attempt to leap up and get that but it goes over him and just clears the rope. He was two yards in, if he'd have been on the ropes he'd have had that. As it is, that's the 12th six, equalling the record in England didn't help themselves with some average fielding at times, including two gaffesque drops. Vaughan's return as captain, though, was strangely encouraging - he was upbeat and seemed to be enjoying himself out there and his field placements were decent - for what they were worth, Australia often And no respite as the fielders amble out to warm-up ... to a background of fireworks from the top of the O'Reilly stand. England are 8-1 to win this ... tight odds. Smoke drifting across the outfield ... Harwood to Vaughan, 1 leg bye hits the pads going down the leg side, bounces into the covers Hilfenhaus to Bell, 4 byes Bell steps to leg, gets a thick inside edge and it shoots past Gilchrist for four. He couldn't have been out to that Hilfenhaus to PD Collingwood, 1 wide banged in, really short and it flies over Collingwood's head as he jerks out of the way Harwood to Dalrymple, 1 wide wide down the leg-side and that's chased ineffectually Symonds to Nixon, 1 wide wide and the batsman shapes to sweep but is too late on the shot Symonds to Lewis, 1 wide leg-side wide this time So the Twenty20 has gone the way of Australia's Ashes campaign - total and utter dominance from the home side, abject humiliation for the visitors.

Getty Images Australia showed no mercy as they crushed England by 77 runs in the Twenty20 at Sydney after piling up the largest total at international level. Andrew Symonds and Cameron White blitzed the hapless attack after the early momentum was created by Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting and they reached 5 for 221. Two wickets in the first two overs of England's chase - including Andrew Flintoff for a duck - ended the contest apart from the interest surrounding Michael Vaughan. England were in the match for about one over and from the moment James Anderson's first six balls went for 14 a huge total was on the cards. The sixth-wicket stand of 66 off 34 balls left the full house in raptures and England had no choice but to tee off from the start of their chase."

Top shot there from Flintoff, came from nowhere really Lee to Flintoff, 1 leg bye pitches on leg, fullish, Flintoff works it to leg, off the leg McGrath to PD Collingwood, OUT jaffer, unplayable. That bounces up and Collingwood's squared up, feathering that one through to Gilchrist for McGrath's third delivery. The way McGrath's been bowling this morning that wicket was pretty inevitable - and just reward for his endeavours Lee to Read, OUT no hiding place this time and he's gone! That one was too good, too fast and Read can't control it, flashing an edge through off the back foot. He could have left it, as it happened, given the ball swung away but it was all over with very quickly. Lee to Mahmood, OUT Lee's on a hat-trick, Mahmood has no idea where that's gone - to Hayden at gully as it happens. Top stuff from Lee again - hostile and England have no answers to either him or McGrath Clark to Harmison, OUT yorker, Harmison shapes to turn to leg but misses, the ball hits him on the full and no doubts with Bowden's decision ... that was going on to hit a third of the way up middle and leg Clark to Flintoff, OUT Flintoff takes two strides down the pitch and aims to thump the ball over extra cover, gets a thick edge and Glichrist holds a good catch diving high to his right. Flintoff slowly heads off as the SCG stands to recognise a fine innings ... and it's five catches for Gilchrist Warne to Panesar, OUT Panesar picks the wrong ball to sweep, it started on off stump and never moved, he missed it and Aleem Dar had a simple decision to make. It's Warne's 1000th international wicket but the celebrations are so muted as to be almost non existent ... a handshake from his colleagues and a And Langer comes out for the last time to a great reception, with Hayden allowing him to walk a few yards ahead. Flintoff with the new ball at the Paddington End. Harmison to Hayden, OUT short and wide, inexplicably Hayden slashes at it and the ball flies off the top edge straight to Collingwood at second slip. Harmison jumps in delight, Hayden stands bemused with his own shot selection for a short time before heading off Panesar to Ponting, OUT now that's a big shout and Panesar thinks the man is gone after Anderson's direct hit from mid-on, ten yards away. A silly single to risk and Bowden nodded immediately there, with replays confirming that Ponting's about a foot short.

Terrible shot from Symonds, looking to swing away on the on-side but plays all round it and he's cleaned up just short of what would have been a well-deserved half-century. He was playing so well, working the singles around, but a head rush, a swoosh, and he's gone Panesar to Warne, OUT ah, the fairytale ends. Warne comes way out of his crease and the wristy Read does the rest, whipping off the bails with ease. That's six dismissals again for Read, as at Melbourne. The SCG rises as one for Warne who jogs off waving his bat. Relief is writ large in the form of a huge 2.30pm A team huddle for Australia, patting and bonding going on. Oh hey now, some handbags are being waved about out there - metaphorically, naturally - Strauss and Ponting are having a real ding-dong. No idea what that's about.

Getty Images Australia surfed a tide of emotion in front of a packed fourth-and-final day crowd, sealing their first Ashes whitewash in 86 years with a ruthless demolition job at Sydney. They had a full two days available to do the necessary, but in the end they needed just under two hours, as England's battered and bruised cricketers surrendered by ten wickets in an abject and embarrassing fashion. Fittingly, it was Glenn McGrath who took centre stage in his final appearance at his home ground, the SCG. After Shane Warne's heroics with the bat, McGrath took over with the ball, grabbing 3 for 38 in 21 typically metronomic overs, before Justin Langer - in partnership with his best mate, Matthew Hayden - rattled off the necessary 46 runs in just 11 overs. It was Hayden who sealed the win, clubbing Sajid Mahmood for six then, after a consultation with Langer, slapping the next for four past point, but McGrath, Langer and Shane Warne were the inevitable stars of the show."
"Bracken to McCullum, SIX runs would you believe it? Bracken! He bowls a knee-high full toss on the stumps and McCullum slams that superbly over deep fine leg for half a dozen! What a game this is! I need a breather and a nice stiff drink. Wow. If you thought the last match was a humdinger, well I'll tell you, this was something else. Bracken just lost the plot in the last over, offering a bleeding full toss to McCullum, a man whose reputation as a last-ditch scrapper has skyrocketed.

Their second-innings 340 at Auckland on Sunday - which was the second-highest chase in ODI history - was bettered again as McMillan showed contempt for the Australia attack despite coming to the crease at 4 for 41. He brought up his first limited-overs century since 2002 with two consecutive sixes off Adam Voges' left-arm orthodox spin, reaching the milestone from only 67 balls, which was the fastest by a New Zealander. He fell with 66 runs needed but McCullum took up the attack and with seven to win off the final over, and with nine wickets down, he launched a Nathan Bracken full toss over midwicket for six from the first ball then slashed behind point for four to win."
"Hodge must be wondering what it takes to score a one-day ton! He was undefeated on 99 against the same side in the CB Series recently and now he falls three short of another well deserved ton. He wouldn't mind that too much though. What an amazing win for the home side and with that they have taken the series 2-0 and have also managed to topple Australia from their No.1 spot in the ICC rankings. Have your say New Zealand won by 5 wickets (with 8 balls remaining) Player of the match is Ross Taylor, NZ","New Zealand 340 for 5 (Taylor 117, Fulton 76*, McMillan 52, Watson 3-58) beat Australia 336 for 4 (Hussey 105, Hodge 97*) by five wickets Scorecard Ross Taylor took few risks on his way to his second one-day century ? Getty Images Australia fell from their No. 1 one-day ranking for the first time as Ross Taylor, Peter Fulton and Craig McMillan propelled New Zealand to their huge target of 337 with an over to spare to secure the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Taylor's century bettered the one Michael Hussey had made to set up Australia's total, which until New Zealand's chase was the highest ODI score at Eden Park. Taylor built the platform for the second-highest successful chase in limited-overs history with 117 before Fulton, and in particular McMillan, hammered Australia to all parts of the ground in the dying stages. McMillan's 52 from 30 balls was telling after New Zealand went into the last ten overs with 91 needed."
"McGrath to Loye, OUT GOT HIM! McGrath dropped it short, as he was bound to do, and Loye tried to keep things positive by playing the hook. But it was a stroke played with no conviction, and a steepling top-edge ended in the hands of deep square-leg! McGrath to Joyce, 1 wide strays down the leg side. Another extra Tait to Bell, 5 wide tried to follow up with the yorker, but that was sprayed down leg. Nice idea, poorly executed White to Flintoff, OUT Flintoff back, it hits him high up and the immediate thought was that it might have been going over the top. It pitched in line and was certainly straight ... is this the start of England's wobble? White to Strauss, 1 wide very wide outside off stump ... Stevie Wonder would have spotted that one Clark to Strauss, 1 leg bye pushed into the off side off his pads as Strauss nicks the strike Bracken to Strauss, OUT well, not a dismissal you'll see in a Test. Strauss walks right across his stumps and scoops the ball to leg ... it goes straight up and Clark only has to move eight or nine yards at backward square leg to take a sitter White to Bell, 1 wide loose again. Not good bowling McGrath to Bell, OUT and the drinks break brings a breakthrough once again! And it's that old shark McGrath who does the job. It was short, Bell went for a big swing, and Gilchrist steadied himself under a big top-edge Tait to Joyce, OUT banged in, Joyce plays a tired pull which he doesn't get hold of and the ball loops to wide midwicket. A great ovation as he walks off. His innings has given England something to bowl at and also ensured that John Buchanan gets his wish of making sure Australia are in a game at last Tait to Bopara, 1 wide short and wide down the leg side There's an extra catcher at gully Mahmood to Hodge, 1 wide erratic - started outside off and swung further away Mahmood to Clarke, 1 wide oops, wide and wider Plunkett to Hayden, 1 leg bye drifting down leg, and deflects away for a single Plunkett to Hayden, 1 wide strays down leg Flintoff to Hayden, 1 wide down the leg-side. These extras are adding up Mahmood to Hayden, OUT there's the breakthrough! And it's that man on the drive who does the trick. Lots of width from Mahmood, Hayden went for a big booming drive and it's a smart reflex take from Jamie Dalrymple at short cover! Not the best ball, but the best result as far as England are concerned Panesar to Bracken, 1 leg bye clipped off the pads, one more to the total Flintoff to Clark, 1 leg bye strays onto the pads Panesar to Bracken, OUT beautiful ball! Tossed right up, much much slower, and Bracken played all round it as the ball crashed into middle and leg. Another one bites the dust, and with Glenn McGrath now at the crease, it's safe to say the game is up. Or is it? Panesar to Tait, SIX runs and so was that, with knobs on! VAST six, slapped way, way over cow corner! That was tossed up at less than 100kph (56mph). He might spear the rest in That's it from us today. We've been Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson.

They were unable to recover ? Getty Images It took ten matches, but England finally managed to beat Australia. And they did it in style by earning a bonus point. In what was easily their best performance of the CB Series, they were superbly led with the bat by Ed Joyce and comfortably defended their hard-earned 7 for 292 to win by 92 runs. As Andrew Flintoff celebrated his first victory as captain in Australia his team had moved level on points with New Zealand and were in with a serious chance of making the finals."
"Toss Ricky Ponting has won the toss and decided to field. He reckons there is a bit of moisture in the pitch that will help his bowlers. A bit! Bracken to Tamim, OUT Got 'em. Bracken takes the pace off the ball and drops it at a good length. Tamim on his knees and thinking of the slog sweep. Then he realises it's too wide and decides to go with the slap over the bowler's head. Can't get the timing yet again and only manages a tame catch to Brad Hogg at mid-off. One down. McGrath to Nafees, OUT Touche! 132.3mph. That's No.55 for GD McGrath, equalling Wasim Akram's record for the most World Cup dismissals. Yorker homing in on middle stump. Too quick for Shahriar and was nailed all ends up. Plays all over it and loses his off stump. GD McGrath, take a bow! McGrath to Shakib, 1 wide Has Halley's comet struck? A wide way down leg side from Mcgrath. Gilchrist dives full length and collects it. Tait to Aftab, 1 wide Poor start. 146mph but full and swinging outside leg. Wide called. But he can pose a real threat with his pace McGrath to Aftab, OUT Catch! You beauty! Back of a length on off, Aftab down the track and tries to drive over mid-off but can't get the timing. Just like Tamim. It appears to have the elevation to beat mid-off but, Oh, look who's there. Nathan Bracken times his jump perfectly and latches on to the ball while in mid-air. You specy! McGrath becomes the Tait to Ashraful, 1 wide Full and angling down leg. Ashraful again tries the sweep-paddle-scoop shot. He's come in with a plan but it's proving a bit risky at the moment. McGrath to Ashraful, OUT Goodbye Mr Ashraful. Slow delivery from the master. Good length on off and tempting, very tempting. Ashraful makes room again and tries to clear mid-on but is deceived by the pace. Ball soars high in the air, Ponting back-peddles and takes a well-judged catch. McGrath's spell reads 3.5-0-9-3. Bread and butter for Pidge Symonds to Habibul Bashar, 1 wide Quick and fired down leg side, Basher almost overbalances and Gilchrist collects it well and snaps off the bails. Fine work there. Appeal goes up for a stumping but the umpire is calling a wide. No need for the third umpire Bracken to Habibul Bashar, 1 wide Around the wicket, full but too wide down leg. Basher tries to work it away but it's too far away Bracken to Habibul Bashar, OUT Another slower ball does the trick. Bracken rolls his fingers over that one and drops it slightly short outside off. Basher pulls it feebly but can't beat Ricky Ponting at short midwicket. Easily done. So Bangladesh have managed 104 for 6 in their 22 overs. They tried to go after the bowling from the word go and lost wickets in the process. Glenn McGrath led the way in his metronomic style while the spinners chipped in well later on. All six wickets were taken by the faster bowlers, though, Australia should not have much of a problem overhauling this. Join Welcome back for Australia's chase. They need 105. Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist are making their way out to join the rest in the middle. Mashrafe Mortaza has the ball in his hands. Mohammad Rafique to Gilchrist, SIX runs Flighted outside off, Gilchrist down the ground in a flash, clatters it over extra cover with a pendulum smooth swing. Man at long-ff but he can't reach that. Way over for a six. So Australia wrap up the first ten-wicket win in this World Cup. It was an expected victory but they went about in in clinical style. Bangladesh let themselves down with the bat and never really had a chance once they made just 104. Hayden and Gilchrist are as devastating an opening pair as any and they completed the job in just 13.5 overs. Australia look un Australia won by 10 wickets (with 49 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn McGrath, AUS","Australia 106 for 0 (Gilchrist 59*, Hayden 47*) beat Bangladesh 104 for 6 (Mortaza 25*, Saqibul 25, Bashar 24, McGrath 3-16) by 10 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Glenn McGrath rocked Bangladesh and became the highest wicket-taker in World Cup history ? AFP Australia were always favourites to bludgeon Bangladesh, but the fact that their Super Eights match was reduced to a mere 22-over-a-side affair made the thrashing appear much more severe. After putting Bangladesh in and keeping them to 104 for 6 - Glenn McGrath picked up 3 for 16 to become the highest wicket-taker in World Cup history - the rampaging Australians barnstormed to the first ten-wicket win of the tournament. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden give bowlers nightmares at the best of times, and when they come out to bat with a license to hit every ball out of sight, and end up doing almost just that, the only emotion you feel is sympathy for those at the receiving end. Gilchrist hit back down the pitch with such exquisite timing that the fielders at mid-on and mid-off had no chance whatsoever. Hayden, who was literally licking his lips at the prospect of nine of the 22 overs being compulsory Powerplays in the rain-affected circumstances, struck sweet blows of his own, but for once was overshadowed."
"The toss: Mark Nicholas was down with the two captains, and looked on as Brian Lara won the toss and elected to field on a virgin strip. The West Indies have brought in Corey Collymore for Ian Bradshaw. Australia have fielded the same side from the win over South Africa, meaning Andrew Symonds is preferred over the in-form Brad Hodge. Taylor to Gilchrist, 1 wide back of a length delivery goes down leg stump for a wide Taylor to Gilchrist, 1 wide but thats another wide well down leg stump, which Taylor doesnt approve of, visibly Powell to Gilchrist, OUT edged and gone! Powell bangs in a shorter one at a good pace, lands on about middle and leg and moves in a tad, Gilchrist hops up and defends, maybe he was trying to get bat out of the way, but there's the thinnest of edges through and Ramdin moves to his right and holds a good catch low down! Gilchrist starts to walk before Asad Ra Taylor to Hayden, 1 wide another bad ball down leg stump, just drifting too far and thats called wide Powell to Ponting, SIX runs bang, thats six! Powell decides to bounce him but the lack of carry does him in, Ponting just swivels on one foot and hooks it over deep backward square leg for half a dozen! Shot! Collymore to Hayden, 1 wide angled down leg stump, Hayden looks to flick but misses and the umpire signals wide Taylor to Ponting, OUT and a piece of brilliance gets rid of a brillant batsman! A good length delivery outside off stump, Ponting lunges forward and drives into the covers and sets off, Sarwan collects the ball and has one stump to aim at, and doesnt miss! A superb throw that catches Ponting just short of his crease, even though he was going full stretch! Bravo to Clarke, OUT and Bravo gets his man! Clarke plays half-cock forward to one that moves in appreciably from outside off stump, gets rapped on the leg, everyone appeals and after a good thought umpire Rauf raises the dreaded finger Bravo to Symonds, 1 wide angled down the leg side off a length and its called wide, duly Bravo to Hayden, OUT full in the zone, no room to work with, and Hayden scoops this in the air straight down the throat of Samuels at long-off, and an excellent innings comes to an end Bravo to Hogg, 1 leg bye full down leg, Hoggs already taken guard well outside leg stump and cant work it away, ends up with a leg-bye to square leg Powell to Hussey, OUT bowled 'em! Hussey reaches out to drive a very full delivery and ends up dragging it back onto off stump! A tame dismissal and Powell's gotten a second in his final over! Collymore to Watson, 1 leg bye full outside off stump, Watson comes well outside the line in an attempt to paddle it fine, the ball hits him on the full and he steals a leg-bye in front of point Bravo to Watson, 1 wide full down leg side, wide called Definitely not good news for the fans out there right now. That means, probably, that if there's no play today, West Indies will still chase 323 with a full 50 overs tomorrow. And thats only if a calculation has been made that they stick to that. Let me remind you that you can now watch an animated representation of our commentary on Cricinfo 3D. It uses all our scoring data to render a 3d representation of the game, with various camera angles for you to play around with, and it has features such as wagon wheels, pitch maps, and the live scorecard. There are also replays after every wicket and boundary on 16:01 local, 20:01 GMT Play has been postponed until tomorrow. The target for West Indies will indeed be 323 from 50 overs. Thats because Australia played out a full 50 overs. Here come Australia, jogging out into the middle under a pleasingly cloud-free sky. We're in for a cracker here today. Just waiting for the two West Indian openers now... Chanderpaul and Gayle stroll, casually, out into the middle. No rush. Smallish crowd so far, just a sprinkling around the ground, but it will no doubt fill up quickly...and very quickly if (Chris) Gayle Force blows in. Bracken to open the bowling around the wicket, and he seems to have a very effeminate hair band on. Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide and, as with Bracken, Tait's first ball is flung down the leg side Tait to Chanderpaul, 1 wide a full-bunger down the leg side rightly called a wide Hogg to Lara, 1 wide short and down the leg side Hogg to Lara, 1 wide down the leg side, Lara sweeps and misses Hogg to Smith, SIX runs now this is a nice shot! Down the track, left, right, left and that's struck very well over cow corner Symonds to Powell, 5 wide the wrong line, drifting down the leg stump and it races for four. Pretty sloppy from GIlchrist Player of the match is Matthew Hayden, AUS","Australia 322 for 6 (Hayden 158) beat West Indies 219 (Lara 77) by 103 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Shaun Tait added two wickets as Australia's march continued ? AFP West Indies, who fancy their chances to be the first host team to win a World Cup, suffered their opening loss of the tournament, a thumping one at that, against a rampant Australia that is slowly building up ominous momentum. Matthew Hayden set the game up with an innings of tremendous control and power on a first day cut in half by rain, and the bowlers backed it up with a cool performance on the second. Chasing 323 against Australia's varied attack is a tough ask at the best of times. Fortunately for the West Indians, the dampness caused by the overnight drizzle at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua did nothing to cause exaggerated assistance for the fast bowlers early on. Nathan Bracken was steady, moving the ball a touch, but the approach of West Indies' openers was strange."
"Langeveldt to Gilchrist, OUT Soft dismissal. South Africa heave a sigh of relief. A slower one on the off stump line and Gilchrist is done in by the change in pace. He shapes to cut but the ball stops on him and he sends a dolly to Gibbs at backward point. What a frenetic start it has been. It was all on a fast-forward motion. No pause or stop button in sight. Until this happenned. Smith to Hayden, SIX runs Down the track and wallops it way over the bowler for a six. Hundred in 66 deliveries. The fastest World Cup hundred. Beating John Davison's record. Brings is up in brutal style Kallis to Hayden, OUT Over. Extra bounce from Kallis and Hayden goes for the cut. On the back foot and punching away but can't keep it down. Can't get it above Gibbs at point, who snaffles a straightforward chance and jumps up in glee. A tame end to a violent innings. But what a knock! Mat the Bat at his devastating best Pollock to Clarke, SIX runs he smoked that. Fifty up in spectacular fashion. He moves to the leg side and heaves a slower one, inside-out over long-off. It went flat, fast and over the ropes. Another stunning hit on this feather-bed of a pitch. Barry Richards, on air, murmurs about the long batting line-up of South Africa. Hopefully, we shall have a interesting game. Hall to Hussey, OUT Holed out. Half-volley on off stump and Hussey tries to loft it over extra cover. Kallis makes good ground and takes a good catch while moving back. Hussey can't manage to clear the short boundary and South Africa limiting the damage here. Ntini to Ponting, OUT Punter is gone. Caught at long on. Goes down on a bent knee and disposes a fullish delivery down the ground. de Villiers didn't have to move an inch and takes it. Ponting exits and enter another big-hitter Andrew Symonds. Roy is in. No breathing space for SA. Smith and de Villiers are out there. The chase is about to begin. Tait to de Villiers, 1 wide Another wide down the leg side. If you have been following Tait's career, this won't be come as a surprise. Tait to de Villiers, 1 wide 149+ k , fast and short but well outside the off stump and a wide is called. Watson to Smith, SIX runs No can intervene that. He has taken the aerial route. Again, he backs away to the leg side and goes through the line. Smooth. Up and over long off. Watson to Smith, 1 wide way outside off stump, Smith can't reach it. Hogg to Pollock, 1 wide googly down the leg side, doesn't turn in enough. The Australian players go into a huddle. Hands over each other's shoulder. They really wanted this one in the bag. Slowly.... they break away and walk towards the pavilion. Player of the match is Matthew Hayden, AUS","Australia 377 for 6 (Hayden 101, Ponting 91, Clarke 92) beat South Africa 294 (de Villiers 92, Smith 74) by 83 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith blitzed away in the early stages, but South Africa couldn't sustain their attack ? AFP The first-round match between South Africa and Australia threatened to be a repeat of the epic at the Wanderers, but St Kitts' Warner Park is no Wanderers, and history steadfastly refused to repeat itself. Australia comfortably defended their 377 for 6, which was set up by Matthew Hayden's fastest World Cup century, and South Africa finished 83 runs adrift. Adam Gilchrist and Hayden put on a century opening stand in less than 15 overs, setting up a launching pad from which the middle-order could wade into the bowling. South Africa's innings started in a similar same way and it was AB de Villiers who ignited the run chase of 378. He stated his intentions emphatically in the first over by crashing a boundary and then following it with an audacious short-arm jab that sailed over midwicket for six."
"de Leede to Hayden, OUT Hayden falls going for the broke. Slow offcutter outside off stump, Hayden has one wild swing, and edges it to Borren at point. de Leede to Ponting, SIX runs Oh ho! There goes Ponting. Probably he was enraged by the earlier appeal. He leans forward to swing it over long-on! de Leede to Gilchrist, OUT Gilchrist is back into the hutch! Full in length, on the middle and leg stump line, driven uppishly straight to mid-on who makes no mistake. He holds on to it and only then throws the ball up in the air, unlike the earlier let off to Ponting. Borren to Hodge, SIX runs Thwack! Full-pitched delivery outside off stump and Hodge knifes it over mid-off. A Aussie girl, in the crowd, throws up an Kangaroo doll in the air in delight. Hmm... Borren to Hodge, 1 wide full and slips down the leg side, Hodge tries to get a tickle but fails Borren to Hodge, SIX runs Wow! This one has disappeared over long-on. The assault is getting ferocious minute by minute. A fullish delivery outside off stump was swung over long-on. Ryan ten Doeschate to Ponting, OUT Wow what a fantastic catch by ten Doeschate! Ponting smashes a low full toss, low to the right of the bowler, who swoops down in a hurry to take the catch. Fab effort. Borren to Clarke, 1 leg bye Huge huge shout for lbw as Clarke misses a low full-toss while trying to lap it to on side. Struck just outside the off stump and hence he survives. Borren to Hodge, OUT Hodge falls. What a knock it has been. A real blitz. The end came as he tried to go for another big one. A fullish delivery, on the off and middle stump line and Hodge shapes to swing it away, misses it completely and is cleaned up. Ryan ten Doeschate to Hodge, 1 leg bye shout for lbw but going down. It landed on a length, on the middle stump line, veered towards leg, and rapped Hodge on the pad. Ryan ten Doeschate to Clarke, 1 wide another wide down the leg side de Leede to Clarke, 1 leg bye huge shout for lbw. Full-pitched, just outside off stump, comes back in and beats the intended drive and raps him on the front pad. But point of impact was outside off stump. Ryan ten Doeschate to Hussey, OUT Hussey goes. He smashes a fullish delivery to long-on but couldn't clear the man at the deep. He had to go for it, just one more over left. Ryan ten Doeschate to Clarke, 2 wide Wide down the leg side. Deflected by the 'keeper Borren to Clarke, SIX runs Another almighty swing and it has been deposited on the top of the roof! A low full toss and he biffed it over the cow corner. The cows are getting really bruised today. Tait to Zuiderent, 1 wide And again. Tait loses control again. That slingy action. Tait to Reekers, 1 wide well outside off stump, Reekers chases it but can't reach it Tait to Ryan ten Doeschate, 1 wide well outside the off stump, left alone. McGrath to van Bunge, OUT World Cup victim no 50. full in length, lands just outside off stump and shapes back in. van Bunge, who was looking in pretty good nick out there, shufled back and stabbed at it. The ball squeezed through and struck him in front of the off stump McGrath to Borren, 1 leg bye slips down leg side, raps him on the pads Hogg to Borren, SIX runs He had more than a clue about this. Leans forward and swings, a tossed-up delivery on the middle, over deep midwicket. Smack! Tait to Borren, 1 leg bye swings to the legs, nudged to square-leg Hogg to Jonkman, OUT It's all over. Googly does the trick. Rips across a wrong'un, on the middle and off stump line, and he didn't pick it. Jonkman tried to work it to on side, fails to maintain balance and drags his feet out of the crease. Gilchrist whips off the bails in a flash to terminate Netherlands' inn Player of the match is Brad Hodge, AUS","Australia 358 for 5 (Hodge 123, Clarke 93*, Gilchrist 57) beat The Netherlands 129 (Hogg 4-27) by 229 runs Live scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Brad Hodge bludgeoned his way to a maiden ODI hundred, hitting eight fours and seven sixes ? AFP The minnow-bashing was not as brutal as South Africa's, but Australia motored along like a well-oiled machine and exploded during the final overs to bat The Netherlands out of the match with 358 for 5. After being stranded in the nineties twice this year, Brad Hodge reached his maiden one-day hundred during what was a perfectly paced innings. Defending 359 was always going to be a cake walk and Australia's battery of fast bowlers was too hot for The Netherlands to handle and they were skittled for 129. The pitch was a belter and Ricky Ponting jumped at the chance of more batting practice. Adam Gilchrist provided the propulsion at the start, but once Australia lost him and Ponting with the score on 116, Michael Clarke and Hodge were impossible to contain during their partnership of 204."
"Brown to Gilchrist, OUT Dougie nails Gilchrist. Scotland fielders mob the bowler. Plumb in front. Full and straight on the middle stump line, Gilchrist tries to swing it across the line on a bent knee. No wood on leather and the ball thuds into the pad. Dea Haq to Hayden, OUT Gotcha! Round the wicket again and the ball pitches on middle and turns away. Hayden tries to drive through the on side but can't account for the spin after the ball grips the surface. Loud appeal and 'slow death' Steve Bucknor raises the Haq to Ponting, SIX runs CRACK! Down the track and Ponting rips a flighted ball from Haq straight over his head for a big six. As easy as Andy there Brown to Ponting, 1 bye drifts away, in the air, outside off, full in length, Ponting reaches out for it, doesn't make contact and the ball bounds of the 'keeper's pad Rogers to Hodge, OUT turns in from outside off, Hussey goes back, eases it to cover region Brown to Hussey, 1 wide Sliding down leg side. Bucknor extends his arms to signal a wide. Wright to Ponting, OUT He is gone! He attempts another slap-slog, across the line, makes no contact and his offstump is pegged back. Haq to Clarke, OUT Gotcha! Haq cleans up Clarke. Flat and fast as the offspinner pushed that one through, slightly short as well and Clarke goes for a pull but is beaten by the pace. The middle stump is pegged back. Hoffmann to Hussey, OUT Colin Smith .... you beauty. Smart work behind the stumps. Full in length and angling away, Hussey makes no contact with his intended drive and his back foot is in the air. Smith gathers and quickly whips off the bails even as Hussey Brown to Hogg, SIX runs Hogg goes downtown. Right in the slot and Hogg creams it over long off. Brown to Hogg, SIX runs smash! Another one, in the slot, just outside off and Hogg drills it over long-off. Murder under cloudy skies Gopalakrishna, who is having a field day today, throws up another one. Out of 29 instances of totals over 300, 18 have come up against non-Test playing nations. This includes some games against Sri Lanka when they were not in the Test panel. Tait to Haq, 1 wide Typical. A wide delivery outside off. Tait to Poonia, 1 leg bye Furious delivery again but drifting down leg. Full ball and Poonia gets a leg bye to fine leg Tait to Poonia, OUT Ripper! Full ball this time and swinging in from outside off. Poonia tries to get his bat down in time but can only end up playing all over it. Ball beats him for pace and clatters into the middle and leg stumps. Too fast and too furious. Tait to Wright, OUT Gone. That's much better. Full and straight and screaming quick. Wright shuffles across the crease and is a sitting duck in front of the wicket. Struck on the pads and Asoka de Silva has no hesitation in giving the decision. Plumb as it Hogg to Smith, OUT Sharp turn there! Cleans up Smith. Lands outside off stump and spins back sharply. He shapes to cut but is surprised by the turn and its all over. Good outing for Smith.

Getty Images The Australia fast bowlers might have hogged a bit of the glory, blasting out the Scotland top order for not too many, but the 203-run victory was set up when Ricky Ponting carved out an authoritative hundred. Several others chipped in as Australia posted a virtually unattainable - for Scotland - 334 for 6. Ponting came out to bat with a solid platform in place, the score reading 91 for 1, and the best of the bowling conditions were already gone. He did not go hammer and tongs early on. If anything, he was extra careful, but the ease with which he was picking off the runs off the full stuff egged the Scotland bowlers to slip in the odd short ball."
"9.40am Sorry that this is becoming more like the Meteorological Office website ... rain has stopped, covers being unpegged in preparation for the toss ... but although there has been no announcement, it's been delayed as it should be happening now. But we are told the start will now be at 10.15am. Mad V emails to point out that Channel 9 and Fox delayed showing the toss while their experts predicted that Australia would bat if they won it. And, lo and behold, when they showed the delayed transmission, that's what happened. Otherwise, check out Sambit Bal's blog from the final. He likes blogs, does our Sambit. Until not so long ago, they would have started the match today and carried on into a second day to ensure both teams got the full 50 overs. The change is for TV companies, who hate their schedules being mucked up. But this is the biggest match in the game. Everything else has been sold out by the ICC, surely for one match they could put cricket before cash? Rant over. 10.35am Back come the main covers as the drops of rain that remained become heavier. This is all very tedious. The delay means that over deductions will kick in fairly soon. We are trying to find out exactly when. ""The tournament has lost its charm right from the beginning with India and Pakistan being out in first round, rain spoiling so many matches and now final too,"" emails Piyush..""Its been dragging on and on."" Many have argued that the World Cup has been poor because of India and Pakistan's elimination. A few have suggested that both should be guaranteed semi-final berths ...

Gilchrist just steps down and takes the ball from short on off and launches it over long-on Murali to Gilchrist, 1 wide down the leg side, but only just...harshly wided by the umpire Dilshan to Gilchrist, SIX runs huge from Gilchrist, absolutely vast six, skipping down the pitch and smacking him dead straight back over Dilshan's head Dilshan to Hayden, 5 wide oh, that's poor from Sri Lanka. A dreadful ball down the leg side, Sangakkara can't do anything to stop it and nor can fine leg Murali to Gilchrist, SIX runs but there he goes, and it's another huge slog-sweep over midwicket, in front of square. It's gone 10 rows back - a vast hit Fernando to Hayden, 1 wide nice idea, poorly executed. Oh poor old Sri Lanka, they're not they're usual chipper selves and it's all rather going wrong for them. Wided outside the off stump Malinga to Hayden, SIX runs That is too imposing. Full ball on off, Hayden backs away and shows his brute force. Rocky and Hulk Hogan in one body, unleashes a mighty hoick over long-off and watches it sail over long-off for a six. One can say it wasn't well timed but it's maximum all the same Malinga to Gilchrist, FOUR runs What a way to bring it up! Full ball outside off and it's slapped ferociously over mid-offf for a four. A century off 72 balls in a World Cup final. Adam Gilchrist take a bow! This has been a sensational effort and Kensington salutes him in admiration. Eight fours and six sixes. Take that Vaas to Gilchrist, 5 wide Vaas losing his bearings here, down the leg side and Sangakkara is standing up. He can't get to it and that's another four down the leg side. Wides, five of them Malinga to Hayden, OUT Finally! Mahela Jayawardene pulls off a smart catch at cover and Hayden has to go. He tried to club it over the short extra-cover fielder but Mahela was waiting there. He timed his jump well and pulled off a double-handed take while in mid-air. Hayden's useful hand comes to an end. It was a 55-ball 38 but nobody will complain when your partner is going banana Jayasuriya to Gilchrist, SIX runs Brutal. Power and timing all the way to midwicket. Gilchrist down the ground in a twinkling flash and blitzes a smooth pendulum swing that soars the ball way over midwicket for a maximum Fernando to Gilchrist, OUT finally finally they get Gilchrist out, Fernando bangs one short, Gilchrist swivels and tries to pull even though the length isn't short enough for the stroke, he gets a top edge and skies it straight to midwicket where Chamara silva takes an easy catch, Gilchrist leaves to a rousing ovation, he Malinga to Watson, OUT bowled him! Shane Watson moves across and tries to play a cheeky paddle sweep over short fine leg, he played it extremely well against New Zealand, but Malinga is too quick for him, Watson doesn't make contact and the ball hits middle and leg stump Dilshan to Hayden, 5 wide oh, that's poor from Sri Lanka. A dreadful ball down the leg side, Sangakkara can't do anything to stop it and nor can fine leg Murali to Hayden, 1 wide again wided down the leg side Murali to Gilchrist, SIX runs but there he goes, and it's another huge slog-sweep over midwicket, in front of square. It's gone 10 rows back - a vast hit Malinga to Hayden, SIX runs That is too imposing. Full ball on off, Hayden backs away and shows his brute force. Rocky and Hulk Hogan in one body, unleashes a mighty hoick over long-off and watches it sail over long-off for a six. One can say it wasn't well timed but it's maximum all the same Vaas to Gilchrist, 5 wide Vaas losing his bearings here, down the leg side and Sangakkara is standing up. He can't get to it and that's another four down the leg side. Wides, five of them Jayasuriya to Ponting, 1 leg bye full ball on middle, good bounce and Ponting tries to sweep it. Rapped on the pads and that's an appeal but it was probably too high Fernando to Gilchrist, OUT finally finally they get Gilchrist out, Fernando bangs one short, Gilchrist swivels and tries to pull even though the length isn't short enough for the stroke, he gets a top edge and skies it straight to midwicket where Chamara silva takes an easy catch, Gilchrist leaves to a rousing ovation, he Malinga to Watson, OUT bowled him! Shane Watson moves across and tries to play a cheeky paddle sweep over short fine leg, he played it extremely well against New Zealand, but Malinga is too quick for him, Watson doesn't make contact and the ball hits middle and leg stump Tait to Upul Tharanga, 1 wide That's down the leg side, Tharanga can't get his bat to it as he tries the flick. Tait tends to be a bit erratic and that's the first wide Bracken to Upul Tharanga, OUT That's more swing, and that's all over. Short of a length and Tharanga doesn't know whether to go forward or back. Stands rooted to the crease and simply pushes his bat limply, the edge is taken and Gilchrist snaps up a regulation catch behind the stumps. That's the first wicket for Australia and it was all to do with the length. Bracken strikes. McGrath to Jayasuriya, 1 wide swing and wide, really wide (is that Mcgrath or Tait?). It swings even after passing Jayasuriya and Gilchrist (I can do nothing wrong today Gilchrist) pulls off a fine save behind the stumps Watson to Jayasuriya, 1 wide Watson responds in the way I would have done. Goes for a yorker and ends up a wide outside off. Shocker. I am happy even the international bowlers do it. McGrath to Sangakkara, SIX runs Sangakkara's best shot of the tournament. Charges down the track like a marauder and smokes a back of length delivery over deep midwicket. Clarke to Silva, SIX runs top shot, really very good indeed. A half-tracker that just hits a squidgy part of the track and sits up innocently, only to be hooked with consummate timing, flat, over midwicket Clarke to Arnold, 2 wide down leg and that's a really wide Clarke to Fernando, 2 wide missed sweep down the leg side, Dar signals a wide to the delight of the umpires who feel he has behaved like a complete fool Tait to Upul Tharanga, 1 wide That's down the leg side, Tharanga can't get his bat to it as he tries the flick.

That's the first wicket for Australia and it was all to do with the length. Bracken strikes. Watson to Jayasuriya, 1 wide Watson bangs it short, too short, the ball balloons over the batsman's head and it's called wide Watson to Jayasuriya, 1 wide Watson responds in the way I would have done.

Charges down the track like a marauder and smokes a back of length delivery over deep midwicket. Clarke to Fernando, 2 wide missed sweep down the leg side, Dar signals a wide to the delight of the umpires who feel he has behaved like a complete fool All shake hands with McGrath as he heads off with a stump. He really deserved to go out on a high, and while he has in that he finishes with a winner's medal, the end has been so unsatisfactory. Australia acknowledge their supporters on a lap of honour as the lights from the stands dazzle out into the night. 6.40pm It's really a sad finish for the Caribbean. We have dancers who have been rehearsing for ages for the post-match celebrations out in the middle around the podium, but nobody can see them as it is now night. Clearly, nobody stopped to consider that the game might not finish on time. Meanwhile, Australia are lapping up the acclaim of their supporters, as well they might. Well, that's about it. Much will be written about the tournament in the coming days but for now from the whole Cricinfo commentary team, it's goodnight and thank you for staying with us over the last seven weeks. Australia have won the World Cup for the third time in a row. Will they make it four in four in Asia in 2011? Player of the match is Adam Gilchrist, AUS","Australia 281 for 4 (Gilchrist 149) beat Sri Lanka 215 for 8 (Jayasuriya 63, Sangakkara 54) by 53 runs on D/L Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Australia put the seal on the most dominant campaign in World Cup history, securing their fourth title and their third in a row since 1999 thanks to Adam Gilchrist's scintillating 149 from 104 balls. But that, sadly, is not what the final of the ICC World Cup West Indies 2007 (to give it its full and fully deserved title) will be remembered for. In a display of cack-handedness that heaped new levels of farce upon a farcical seven weeks, the final overs of a broken contest were played out in near-darkness, penetrated only by the glow of the pavilion lights and the bewildered blinking of 20,000 flash bulbs. Whatever went on in those overs is anyone's guess. It was too dark for the fielders to see anything, let alone any of the fans in the stadium or the press in the gantry, and besides, the Australians had already celebrated their moment of victory."
"8.55am Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the second semi-final between Australia and South Africa, with the winners taking on Sri Lanka in Saturday's final. Team and toss news to follow any second ... Bracken to de Villiers, no run a similar line, de Villiers pushes the ball no more than five or six yards into the leg side McGrath to de Villiers, 1 wide that started wide of off and swung significantly, an easy wide to call and Gilchrist had to scurry across to gather Bracken to Smith, OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball, shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump McGrath to Kallis, OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball, but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Watson to Langeveldt, OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt, again giving himself room, is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Bracken to Smith, OUT Smith again walks down the pitch to meet the ball, shapes to hit over the top and a sniff of swing takes the ball past the bat and into the off stump McGrath to Kallis, OUT Kallis again gives himself room and advances to meet the ball, but McGrath fires in a yorker which clatters into the off stump Tait to de Villiers, OUT full, de Villiers drives with no foot movement, and a thick kick carries straight to Gilchrist. A fourth delivery over 90mph, a good mixture of length, and now South Africa are up against it McGrath to Boucher, OUT McGrath on a hat-trick ... much better ball, a stock McGrath delivery, Boucher plays a nothing prod and the ball is held low down by Matthew Hayden at first slip Tait to Kemp, 5 wide oh dear, Tait's replaced his sniper rifle with the greater-spotted potato gun. This is miles down the leg side and Gilchrist doesn't have a chance Watson to Kemp, SIX runs short and Kemp's on that one so quickly, fending the ball with a hook right off his helmet - top work, that was close to him, and although he didn't get hold of it properlyit sailed away. And that's the fifty partnership Hogg to Gibbs, 1 wide outside leg, chased round, and that's just to say wide Tait to Gibbs, OUT got him this time! A very, very thin edge - much thinner than the one which wasn't given earlier, also to Tait - looking for the short-pitched delivery. His feet were just rooted in the crease there as he chased the ball away from his body Hogg to Kemp, 1 wide wide down off, Kemp backs away to give himself room to cut, but that one went the other way and he was miles away from it Tait to Nel, OUT short and wide, slashed high to backward point who backpeddled and took an easy catch above his head Tait to Hall, OUT and Tait strikes again! Hall looked to lash that off the back foot through cover, but his feet must have been dipped in the same tub of superglue as Gibbs's as he strikes at the ball away from the body and a thickish edge rips through. Gilchrist makes no mistake Watson to Langeveldt, OUT up in the block hole and Langeveldt, again giving himself room, is in no position to play it and is cleaned up Pollock to open (the bowling. Obviously. He hasn't defected to Australia). Blustery out there which could help him. Let's face it; South Africa need all the assistance they can get Kallis to Hayden, 1 wide good bounce from Kallis but, oh dear, it's very wide of the off stump and rightly wided by the not-so-wide umpire Australia win by seven wickets The South Africans acknowledge the support they have received and then head off to lick their wounds, the Australians amble onto the outfield and start a lap of honour. That's all from Jenny Thompson, Will Luke and Martin Williamson. Many thanks for staying with us through a one-sided match and we will be back, along with Sriram Veera and Jamie Alter, for Saturday's final. It's almost all over ... Australia won by 7 wickets (with 111 balls remaining) Player of the match is Glenn McGrath, AUS","Australia 153 for 3 (Clarke 60*, Hayden 41) beat South Africa 149 (Kemp 49*, Tait 4-39, McGrath 3-18) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out History suggested it would be a close encounter, possibly even a classic, but in the end the second semi-final turned into a cakewalk for Australia as they cruised into their fourth successive World Cup decider. Their potent pace attack tore out South Africa's first five wickets inside ten overs and there was no way back. Shaun Tait, who earned a career-best 4 for 39, formed a lethal combination with Glenn McGrath and the Australia batsmen knocked off the target inside 32 overs. South Africa's campaign has lurched from one extreme to the other and their latest performance did nothing to quell Australia's thoughts of a psychological hold. The approach from South Africa hinted at a side that was too pumped up and aware of the need to take the match to Australia."
"Franklin to Clarke, OUT OMG! Clarke shoulders arms and hey presto! the middle stump has gone for a walk. Unbelievable! Comedy of errors. It was a slower one, on the middle, Clarke backed away, raised his bat and then was indecisive what to with the delivery. He just let the bat hang high Patel to Symonds, OUT Done in the flight and Mason gets under a swirling delivery at long off. Tossed-up and Symonds charged out but it dipped outside off stump and Symonds reached out and ended up scooping it out high. It swirled as it came down, Mason went left and left, then to right, Gillespie to Hussey, 1 leg bye length-delivery, angling in on the middle and leg, tries to lap it away, and it rolls of the pad Franklin to Hussey, OUT Fools Hussey with a slower one. From over the wicket, full and outside off, Hussey went down his knee and tried to swing it across the line, got a top edge to square-leg. Franklin to Watson, SIX runs Up .. up and over long on. Full, from round the stumps, right in the slot and Watson knives through the line. Mason to Hayden, 1 wide Franklin bowls no ballsand Mason says time for me to bowl wides. From round the stumps and it slips down the leg side. Mason to Hayden, SIX runs Biffed. Clubbed and the rest of that Batman and Robin comic strip exclamations would fit. Fullish, on the middle stump line, Hayden heaves forward, takes out the front leg from the line and smokes it straight over the bowler's head and it soars over the boundary. Styris to Ponting, 2 wide slips down the leg side, Ponting tries to lap it around the corner, misses and blinds McCullum in the process and it bobs away off McCullum's gloves Franklin to Hussey, OUT Fools Hussey with a slower one. From over the wicket, full and outside off, Hussey went down his knee and tried to swing it across the line, got a top edge to square-leg. Franklin to Watson, SIX runs Up .. up and over long on. Full, from round the stumps, right in the slot and Watson knives through the line. In the record chase in Hamilton New Zealand hunted down 346. Today they have to beat that. 349 to win. Can they? The wicket has got a bit slower. Join us in a while to find out. As you would have noticed, I goofed up. This is McGrath's 66th wicket in World cup. not in this one. Now that would be a carnage. So please hold your mails. Tait to Fleming, OUT gets him with a bouncer. Fleming is not happy. Banged in short, on the middle and off, Fleming tries to pull off the front foot, the ball bounces more than he anticipated, and thudded into his left arm before bobbing away to Ponting at second slip. They go up in appeal Bracken to Styris, 1 wide way outside the off stump, left alone Tait to McMillan, OUT nailed 'em. Full length ball pitching on off and rattling McMillan's pads. It strikes him on middle and, despite Tait delivering from a wide angle, it would have gone on to hit leg stump. Asad Rauf waits for the long appeal to subside before lifting the finger. It's Tait to Franklin, 1 wide wide outside off, wayward this time Watson to Franklin, OUT done by the change of pace. Around 111k slower one, full and outside off, Franklin goes for a drive, is early into the stroke, gets a inside-edge and drags on to the stumps. Five down and boy are they wobbling or what? Watson to McCullum, 1 wide way down the leg side. Tait to Mason, 1 wide banged in short but it sails down leg side Tait to Fulton, 1 wide way outside the off stump. Wide. Tait. Are they synonyms? Watson to Franklin, OUT done by the change of pace. Around 111k slower one, full and outside off, Franklin goes for a drive, is early into the stroke, gets a inside-edge and drags on to the stumps. Five down and boy are they wobbling or what? Watson to McCullum, 1 wide way down the leg side. Tait to Mason, 1 wide banged in short but it sails down leg side Player of the match is Matthew Hayden, AUS","Australia 348 for 6 (Hayden 103, Ponting 66, Watson 65*) beat New Zealand 133 (Fulton 62, Hogg 4-29) by 215 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out Matthew Hayden's century was the 100th hundred in World Cups and it set up a crushing win ? AFP Matthew Hayden's third hundred of the competition, the hundredth case of a century in World Cups, was at the heart of a power-packed Australian batting performance during a thumping 215-run triumph against New Zealand in Grenada. Australia, clearly the best team in the tournament, are now two steps away from claiming a hat-trick of World Cups and will travel to St Lucia to take on South Africa in the second semi-final on Wednesday. It was a dominant, almost vengeful, Australian effort, one which would have helped erase the painful memories of the 3-0 whitewash in the recent Chappell-Hadlee series. Hayden shone the brightest but Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson chipped in with valuable fifties - the first a bustling knock at the top, the second a blitzer at the end. New Zealand were without Shane Bond and Jacob Oram, who were out with injury and illness, but this turned into a nightmare of sorts, ending in their worst defeat in one-day history."
"Tait to Jayasuriya, 1 wide strives for the yorker again but ends up bowling it way outside leg stump Bracken to Jayasuriya, OUT gone! Good length outside off stump, moving in, Jayasuriya stands rooted and gets caught on the front leg pretty much in front of about leg stump, and after a couple seconds umpire Doctrove raises the finger! The dangerous Jayasuriya goes to Bracken! McGrath to Sangakkara, OUT gone! Tough call - pitches on a good length just outside off stump, moves in, Sangakkara stands behind the line and defends, misses, the ball shaves in hits him on the knee roll, everyone appeals and after a while Aleem Dar raises the finger! I have doubts over the height of that ball, lo Bracken to Upul Tharanga, OUT edged and gone! Set him up with a couple inswingers, this time he fires it full and gets it to seam away as Tharanga pushes forward, and the edge is snapped up by Hayden at first slip, taking it very low even as Ponting from second dives in front of him! Bracken to Silva, 1 leg bye inswinger moving down leg stump, he looks to flicks and manages one off the pad to short fine leg as Gilchrist does the fielding himself Tait to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide full and wide down leg stump, wide called Tait to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 wide full and wide, down leg stump, and called Tait to Dilshan, OUT banged in short outside off stump, Dilshan hooks, awfully mistimed, and the ball just bobs up for Hodge to pouch a dolly at square leg Tait to Maharoof, 1 wide too full down leg stump, the yorker going wrong Tait to Arnold, OUT bowled 'em with another short one! Quick, too bouncy for Arnold, who stands rooted and gets cramped on the swipe, all tangled up, and the result is an inside-edge back onto the stumps Bracken to Kulasekara, OUT edged and gone! Bracken maintains his probing, moving line outside off stump, shaping one across Kulasekara to drive on the up, and the thick edge is snapped up very well by Hayden at a deep lone slip, down near his ankles, his second beauty of the day Hogg to Silva, OUT goddim! Tossed up on middle and leg, now he prefers the more orthodox sweep, but mistimes it and the top-edge is easily gobbled up by Clarke at short fine leg, success for Hogg Hogg to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT well bowled, well stumped! Hogg tosses up a beauty on a great length, Jayawardene lunges forward, plays for turn, is beaten in the flight and all Gilchrist has to do it whip off the bails as the back leg's in the air, neatly done, and Hogg gets another key batsman McGrath to Bandara, OUT he ends his spell with another, banging in a long-hop, Bandara pulls and can only balloon it up to Hogg at midwicket for a comfortable take Bracken to Maharoof, OUT all over, Bracken finishes the innings with a slower one that Maharoof just chips in the air down to Symonds at long-on Bracken to Jayasuriya, OUT gone!

AFP A couple of Sri Lanka batting collapses turned a potentially cracking contest into a one-sided affair, as Australia wrapped up a comprehensive seven-wicket win. The move to rest Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan weakened Sri Lanka's bowling but it was the unchanged batting line up that faltered on a true surface in Grenada. Australia were clinical, seizing the openings without fail and stamping their authority when it counted. They lost the toss but made full use of the early swing before witnessing a well-crafted 140-run stand between Mahela Jayawardene and Chamara Silva for the fourth wicket. Nathan Bracken gave little away, ending with 4 for 19 from 9."
"McGrath to Bray, OUT and that's a very early strike indeed, inswing clipped the outside of off stump. Bray didn't move his feet, tried to jab down on it. Failed Tait to Porterfield, OUT right up there, straight, on leg, not much swing, too quick for the batsman and not much time's needed for the decision Tait to N O'Brien, OUT ...and out again: full toss, and there's no footwork as the batsman drags a huge inside edge back onto his stumps and Tait's on a hat-trick Tait to K O'Brien, 1 wide down leg, Tait must think he's still bowling to lefthanders Tait to K O'Brien, 1 wide more of the leg stuff, this one rising a bit more, hopping over O'Brien's bent back McGrath to Morgan, OUT very soft, on off stump, and that's outside-edged to first slip.

An excellent slower ball which he misread, spooning it over McGrath's head Clark to K O'Brien, OUT drifting onto his pads and timed beautifully, with an elegant flick of his wrists, but he picks out Hodge at short midwicket who didn't need move an inch, taking the ball at head height Tait to Johnston, OUT but he's got him this time. Clever bowling from Tait, sending it just a touch wider and enticing the drive. Johnston goes for an expansive slap through the covers, but instead the ball slaps into his stu Tait to Mooney, 3 wide well that's vicious, if wooly - not to mention wild. Short, and he ducks underneath it Symonds to McCallan, OUT gone this time. McCallan was getting fed up with all this poking and prodding Hogg to D Langford-Smith, OUT Dave's gone! Stepping back, not picking it at all, he tries to defend but it takes the outside edge, ballooning to Ricky Ponting at silly point Hogg to Rankin, 1 wide drifting down the leg side Clark to K O'Brien, 1 wide Clarke continues where his team-mate left off with a leg-side wide Hogg to Mooney, 2 wide chased that down leg, but it's wide all the same Hogg to Mooney, OUT driven to mid-off and Tait shies down the stumps on the bounce McGrath to Bray, OUT and that's a very early strike indeed, inswing clipped the outside of off stump.

Getty Images With the ruthlessness that everyone has come to expect from the Australians, they overwhelmed Ireland by nine wickets at Bridgetown after demolishing them for 91. The pace and bounce of Glenn McGrath and Shaun Tait proved too much for the Irish top order, as they removed the top four inside five overs, and only three batsmen reached double figures. The result confirms Australia as the first team in the semi-finals. Australia could have decided to use this match to hone their all-round game: have a bat, rack up 300-plus then bowl when the track was slower. But they are a team with one focus: winning as quickly and effectively as possible."
"England win the toss and bat first. Well done them. No news of Australia's team yet. The big winners are keeping it close to their chests. Ah, here they are. Well it's what we expected really. Just Brad Hodge coming in for the when-will-he-ever-not-be-injured Shane Watson. Tait to Vaughan, OUT gone! Again short from Tait, Vaughan went back and simply played it onto his stumps. Tait to Strauss, 1 wide another bouncer - and, rejoice, it's wided by the umpire. Tait to Strauss, 1 wide the first genuinely filthy wide from Tait and Gilchrist, well - he does brilliantly to save four (or rather, five), diving to his right Tait to Strauss, OUT gone! A mirror of Vaughan's dismissal McGrath to Bell, OUT oh there we go, Bell departs - McGrath perhaps held it back a touch, Bell trying to drive it over cover but his head fell back and the ball spooned to Hussey at extra cover Tait to PD Collingwood, OUT lovely delivery, top class that one: Collingwood looking for the reverse swing and playing away from his body on his back foot. There's just a thin edge - but one without doubt - and Gilchrist clings on Tait to Flintoff, 1 wide strays that one down leg, Tait immediately turns to look at Rudi Koertzen, expecting a wide... the umpire thinks about it, and then makes the sign Hogg to Flintoff, OUT a little touch of air and the ball tempts him outside his crease. It deviates past his outside edge, turning a touch and Gilchrist completes the move with some sharp glovework and Flintoff's on his way Bracken to Bopara, OUT what a shot, but he's found Hussey at deep midwicket. It was an extraordinary flick, timing it to Hussey on the boundary who took an easy catch Bracken to Pietersen, OUT and he's gone this time, trying to lift Bracken for six but it's hit flat, and straight to Michael Clarke who needs not move a muscle, taking a very simple catch Bracken to Mahmood, OUT another full toss, well, what a catch! That's a marvellous catch from Hodge, Mahmood slicing it to him at backward point who tumbled to his right and took a fine catch McGrath to Nixon, OUT and he tries to replicate the shot before, smacking a full toss but straight down Hodge's throat at long-on who swallows it with ease McGrath to Anderson, OUT full, swinging into Anderson who completely misreads the line. McGrath roars his appeal and up goes the finger Tait to PD Collingwood, OUT lovely delivery, top class that one: Collingwood looking for the reverse swing and playing away from his body on his back foot. There's just a thin edge - but one without doubt - and Gilchrist clings on Hogg to Flintoff, OUT a little touch of air and the ball tempts him outside his crease. It deviates past his outside edge, turning a touch and Gilchrist completes the move with some sharp glovework and Flintoff's on his way McGrath to Bopara, 1 wide that was rather close to plucking out his leg stump there, and Gilchrist missed a potential stumping chance. Rather unfairly called a wide, too Bracken to Bopara, OUT what a shot, but he's found Hussey at deep midwicket. It was an extraordinary flick, timing it to Hussey on the boundary who took an easy catch Bracken to Pietersen, OUT and he's gone this time, trying to lift Bracken for six but it's hit flat, and straight to Michael Clarke who needs not move a muscle, taking a very simple catch Bracken to Mahmood, OUT another full toss, well, what a catch! That's a marvellous catch from Hodge, Mahmood slicing it to him at backward point who tumbled to his right and took a fine catch McGrath to Nixon, OUT and he tries to replicate the shot before, smacking a full toss but straight down Hodge's throat at long-on who swallows it with ease McGrath to Anderson, OUT full, swinging into Anderson who completely misreads the line. McGrath roars his appeal and up goes the finger 1.45pm Welcome back. Here come Gilchrist and Hayden, needing five an over, which should be comfortable on this track. Andrew Miller reckons 247 is a winning total. Let's find out shall we? It'll be James Anderson to take the new ball, a cricket ball, and not the beach ball that's blown onto the pitch. Here we go Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide great delivery to a righthander... unfortunately Hayden isn't, and that one slinks down leg, on a good length, but wide enough to be called so PD Collingwood to Symonds, SIX runs slower ball and there's no doubt this time - Symonds powers that over mid-off and that's gone all the way for six, nice Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide great delivery to a righthander... unfortunately Hayden isn't, and that one slinks down leg, on a good length, but wide enough to be called so Anderson to Hayden, 1 wide leg-side filth PD Collingwood to Ponting, 1 wide an attempted stumping from an off-side wide. A bit harsh the wide, you'd suspect, but no doubt on the fact that Ponting's foot was firmly grounded Mahmood to Ponting, 1 wide down the leg side and that'll be a wide Flintoff to Clarke, 1 leg bye have some of that, umpire, Flintoff asks. But the umpire's had more than enough of it, and it's not out - drifting down leg by some distance Flintoff to Symonds, 1 leg bye caressed off the hips, literally, behind square Well played Australia, they deserved that victory - good captaincy from Ponting to apply the squeeze once Pietersen and Bell had got them into a decent position in England's innings. Another victory for Australia, then, the deserved favourites, and that's 18 straight World Cup wins for them. Take that. England, meanw Australia won by 7 wickets (with 16 balls remaining) Player of the match is Shaun Tait, AUS","Australia 248 for 3 (Ponting 86, Clarke 55*) beat England 247 (Pietersen 104, Bell 77) by seven wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out - England How they were out - Australia Ricky Ponting led from the front with the bat and in the field ? Getty Images Ricky Ponting's 86 was the major feature for Australia as they completed a seven-wicket win against England in Antigua with 16 balls to spare. The result virtually assured them of a semi-final berth and left their rivals clinging on by their fingernails. Kevin Pietersen's fourth ODI ton, like his other three, came in a losing cause, with Australia's three frontline pacemen responding to Ponting's clever captaincy as the innings fell away dramatically. While Pietersen and Bell were adding 140 in 23 overs Australia were being challenged for the first time since South Africa's opening stand in St Kitts. Like they did on that occasion, they passed the test with flying colours."
"Lee to Jayasuriya, OUT he's gone this time, and that was another cracker - fuller, faster and angling back into the left-hander. No room to play any shot whatsoever, and up goes the finger! Bracken to Upul Tharanga, OUT that dismissal was somewhat telegraphed. He was dancing around at the crease and, in attempting to whip to leg, found only a leading edge. Brett Lee at deep point swallows a looping chance, and Sri Lanka are in deep trouble now Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, OUT oh dear, this is carnage. Jayawardene was in no position for that stroke - a wristy whip through midwicket that turned into a looping chance for Stuart Clark at mid-on. He did well to dive forward and scoop it off the turf, but a very loose shot from Sri Lanka's captain Johnson to Silva, 1 wide not such a good ball. Pitches outside leg and stays that way Clark to Silva, OUT he frees his arms this time, but to absolutely no avail - a massive windmill of a wind-up, but a ball that was intended to vanish over the covers instead spirals down to Brett Lee on the third man boundary. Credit to Clark, he built the pressure and Silva cracked Clark to Dilshan, OUT that wasn't very clever. Dilshan tries to improvise, he steps outside off and tries to sweep off a good length, but instead pats a simple chance straight into Gilchrist's gloves as he hops to the leg-side. Another one bites the dust, and with the exception of Jayasuriya, they've all been tame dismissals Watson to Mubarak, OUT slower delivery, the offspinner and the pressure told on Mubarak, trying to clear extra cover with a drive off one knee but Symonds makes no mistake, stepping back and clasping to take Sri Lanka into further trouble Watson to Malinga, SIX runs but this is much better - Malinga lifting a hook from outside off in front of midwicket Symonds to Vaas, OUT a big - but ultimately ineffectual - swing, Vaas down the track and picks out Lee at deep midwicket, five yards in from the rope, who does well stretching out to his right Bracken to Fernando, OUT a poor shot - indicative of Sri Lanka's day - to finish. A slower ball from Bracken, and the batsman pops up a bottom edge back towards the bowler who has a second to think about before taking confidently Fernando to Hayden, 1 leg bye somehow, the leg-stump line is proving very effective in this over. This time, backward square can't stop the single Dilshan to Gilchrist, 1 wide misdirected, down the leg side, well taken by Sangakkara ""Our fielders and our bowlers were outstanding. To chase on that wicket ... it's getting really tired and it would have been difficult. Our bowlers definitely won that match for us."" So, that's that. Australia wrap up a ten-wicket victory with almost half of their overs to spare, and it is they who march on to the semi-finals where they will be joined by Pakistan, South Africa (barring miracles) and either New Zealand or India. Australia won by 10 wickets (with 58 balls remaining) Player of the match is Stuart Clark, AUS","Australia 102 for 0 (Hayden 58*, Gilchrist 31* ) beat Sri Lanka 101 (Clark 4-20) by ten wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details The rot starts here ... Brett Lee strikes to remove Sanath Jayasuriya with the third ball ? Getty Images A match billed as a winner-takes-all contest was as good as decided before latecomers had even taken their seats at Newlands. In that time Australia blew away Sri Lanka's top order, and though they made a recovery of sorts to reach 101, it was a dismal performance and Australia strolled to a ten-wicket win with almost half their overs intact."
"13.40: Toss: News from the middle is that Ricky Ponting has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. Clark to Nazimuddin, 1 wide sliding down leg, Nazimussin tries to work it fine Johnson to Nazimuddin, OUT good reflexes, driven hard to cover, Ponting gets a hand to it, fumbles and in the second attempt takes the catch, all over in a flash Johnson to Aftab, 1 wide starts off with a wide outside off stump Clarke to Tamim, OUT caught! Tamim gives Clarke the charge and tries to loft him down the ground, he slices it high in the air and Ricky Ponting settles under the catch at cover and judges it to perfection Lee to Shakib, OUT caught! Shakib backs away and tries to cut but Lee follows him and cramps him for room with a short of a length ball, Shakib gets a thick edge that is taken by Gilchrist Lee to Mortaza, OUT bowled first ball! Lee fires in the yorker on off stump, Mortaza backs away trying to hit on the off side and is clean bowled Lee to Kapali, OUT he's got him! Lee's angles the ball from a good length into Alok Kapali who moves across his stumps and tries to play through midwicket, he gets hit flush on the pad and Asad Rauf raises the finger, awesome stuff from Lee Bracken to Aftab, OUT caught! Aftab gives Bracken the charge and tries to slog him over midwicket, there's no pace on the ball from Bracken and Aftab skies it in the air to Brad Hodge who takes a well-judged catch looking straight into the sun Bracken to Farhad, OUT Reza slogs Bracken high in the air down to long-on where Michael Hussey takes a superb catch just inside the boundary, he looks back to see where his back foot is, it is just inside the boundary Stats - When Gilchrist caught Shakib Al Hasan, he equalled Mushfiqur Rahim's record for the most dismissals by a wicketkeeper, eight. After their wham-bam approach against South Africa yesterday, the Bangladesh innings has been a complete anti-climax. They shelved their natural instincts at the start and never gained any momentum. They had plenty of wickets to make a late charge but Lee's hat-trick, the first in Twenty20 internationals, put paid Gilchrist and Hayden walk out. Bangladesh will have to field out of their skins to defend this total. Mashrafe Mortaza to open Syed Rasel to Hayden, 1 wide wide outside off, hayden has a wild swing, misses it Razzak to Gilchrist, SIX runs Gilchrist charges down the track and lofts the ball cleanly over the head of the fielder at long-off, that's his fourth six The game was over as a contest after the Australians restricted Bangladesh to 123. Brett Lee became the first bowler to take a Twenty20 hat-trick and all the other bowlers bowled a superb line and length to keep Bangladesh on a leash. Bangladesh's batsmen were very disappointing after their break-neck start agains Australia won by 9 wickets (with 37 balls remaining) Player of the match is Brett Lee, AUS","Australia 124 for 1 (Hayden 73*, Gilchrist 43) beat Bangladesh 123 for 8 (Lee 3-27) by 9 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details How they were out True to form: Mathew Hayden bullied Bangladesh with a belligerent 73 not out ? Getty Images It was swift and clinical. Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals as Australia's fast bowlers hit a persistent short-of-length to set the game up and restrict Bangladesh to 123, before Mathew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist easily powered Australia to a nine-wicket win. Bangladesh had detonated the West Indies and South African new-ball attacks but that was because they were offered a fuller length that allowed them to blast through the line. Australia recognised it and didn't offer much on the fuller side today. The idea was to put the ball in the right place, as Lee emphasised at the end of the match."
"Hosein to Carey, 1 wide good length ball grips and turns sharply from middle down the leg side, wide called. Hosein to Carey, OUT Carey looked uncomfortable all over long to Hosein and finally comes undone! Hosein tosses this up with more flight full on fifth stump to encourage a drive against the turn to mid-off, but he's been getting sharp turn all over and Carey doesn't get to the pitch. Unsurprisingly he pays the price as the ball rips past the inside edge of the attempted drive, through the gate and crashes into middle stum Hosein to Henriques, OUT edge to slip! Hosein once again slows it down and flights it more getting the just rewards. This one is on sixth stump on a full length, Henriques gropes at this well away from his body in awkward fashion with a cross bat swipe and the extra bounce plus sharp turn has it fly off a thick edge to Holder at rib height moving to his right at slip. Hosein to Turner, OUT Hosein is ripping through this entire order with the sharp turn on offer! He was bowling his first handful of deliveries in the 90-94 kph range but slows this up at 86 kph and once more is rewarded. Turner gropes forward at this good length ball on leg stump and it rips past the outside edge to clatter the top of off! Hosein to Wade, 1 wide starts a touch too straight this time and turns down the leg side Walsh to Starc, 1 wide down the leg side Walsh to Starc, OUT big appeal for lbw, it's a long, long appeal...Joel Wilson says not out and Pollard calls the review. Starc sweeping, struck on the back leg. This looks pretty close. And it's hitting the top of middle stump Mohammed to Zampa, 1 wide full down leg side, goes to sweep and misses. Wide called. Joseph to Wade, OUT soft soft dismissal. Wade is gutted! Full in the slot on sixth stump at 133 kph, a hit me ball and Wade does so but fails to elevate this in his effort to shovel it over the ring. Pooran reaches up above his head on the circle at extra cover to intercept this with ease. Wade drops to a knee after realizing he's thrown it away after doing so much hard work to dig Australia out of trouble. Cottrell to Agar, SIX runs Agar is rallying Australia into a winning position! Cottrell spears this in full on fourth stump at 134 kph, Agar backs away and cracks a drive high and deep over wide long-off. Cottrell to Zampa, OUT yorker finally cleans up Zampa. Full on the stumps at 130 kph, Zampa backs away to heave over cover and misses, off stump is uprooted. Cottrell gives a very tame and frustrated salute, almost in disgust that they've allowed this stand to last for as long as it has. Zampa has played an incredibly valuable hand and the West Indies know it. Joseph to Agar, OUT you wait all day for a bus and then two come at once! Joseph firest this in full and a yard outside leg stump following Agar backing way away from the stumps. Agar tries to flick over square leg but gets a leading edge that balloons over point. Lewis takes a catch backpedaling from the ring. West Indies were in front for the majority of the innings but heading into the break it is Australia who look like favorites to come out of this match with 10 valuable points on the World Cup Super League points table because the West Indies are facing a tricky target on a crumbling wicket. Stay with us for the start of the chase in a bit. Chase ready to begin. Starc has the new ball over the wicket to Lewis. Hope off strike. Two slips in place. Starc to Lewis, 1 leg bye full on the legs, clipped into square leg after a missed flick. Leg bye signaled. Starc to Bravo, 1 wide full and down leg at 143 kph, Starc will have another bonus ball to bowl. Agar to Hope, 1 wide full ball down leg, another extra added to the total. Starc to Holder, 1 leg bye short of a length on leg stump, deflects backward of square Starc to Holder, OUT full and angled into the pads, Holder prods forward and it beats the bat clanging into the pads just above the knee roll. Big lbw shout upheld and Holder calls for DRS straight away. A lump forms in Joel Wilson's throat... This one is touch and go. And ball-tracking shows it skimming the bails. Umpire's call stays on field. Joel Wilson narrowly avoids an Audi, and Holder's innings has ended. West Indies won by 4 wickets (with 72 balls remaining) Player of the match is Nicholas Pooran, WI","West Indies 191 for 6 (Pooran 59*, Holder 52, Starc 3-26) beat Australia 187 (W Agar 41, Hosein 3-30) by four wickets Nicholas Pooran and Jason Holder rescued West Indies from more top-order troubles to level the ODI series in Barbados in the match that was delayed by 48 hours after the Covid-19 scare in the home side's camp. In the end it was Australia's collapse that proved decisive when they crumbled to 45 for 6 as left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein claimed three wickets in six balls. The last four wickets turned the innings around by adding 142, which included a 59-run ninth-wicket stand between Adam Zampa and Wes Agar, then when West Indies slipped to 72 for 5 - with Mitchell Starc again brilliant - there was the chance of a remarkable resurgence. However, Pooran and Holder played with excellent composure knowing that the required rate was never an issue. Pooran was given lives on 26 and 49, the first when Moises Henriques spilled a simple chance at mid-off, and Holder was reprieved by the DRS but it was a well-constructed stand during which Holder brought up his first ODI fifty since the 2019 World Cup while Pooran was unbeaten to finish things off."
"1.02pm Time for the toss: Australia have won the toss and will bat de Grandhomme to Finch, 1 leg bye full, on the pads, and he looks to whip it away on the on side. Off his pads towards square leg Boult to Finch, OUT length, and jags back into him and traps him in front! Just a bit of seam movement back into him, and Finch shakes his head as he walks off. The umpire was fairly easily convinced that this would have hit the top of off and middle, and the Australia captain agreed. What a start for New Zealand! Ferguson to Warner, OUT short, and he has got Warner with a snorter! Delivered at 142kph, and following him as he looks to sway out of its way, this ball takes off and takes Warner along its way through to Latham. Ferguson had no doubt, and neither did Warner. Both openers dismissed this early, wow! Ferguson to Smith, OUT falls into the trap! New Zealand had a leg gully lurking. They were going to attack SS with the short ball. They were hoping he'd flick one in the air and this guy can grab it. But this is a full blooded pull shot. This is coming off at a zillion miles an hour. And it's not even right at the fielder. A fielder who's already dropped two catches. Guptill doesn't care though. He spots the b Neesham to Khawaja, 1 leg bye walks right across his stumps and gets struck on the pads as he tries to flick the ball through midwicket. Khawaja is trying to one-up NZ's 6-3 off side field Neesham to Khawaja, 1 wide full and very very wide outside off and he'll have to re-bowl that Neesham to Stoinis, OUT caught behind! Neesh delivers an absolute peach. A cross-seamer that hits the deck. The line is close enough to off stump. The length though is in-between. Not full enough for the drive. Not short enough for the cut. Stoinis presses forward gamely, looking to block the ball out. But it's mischief not done yet. It decks away off the pitch, takes the outside edge and settles in the keeper Neesham to Maxwell, OUT WHAT A CATCH! If you thought Guptill had one of the rippers for the day, Jimmy Neesham has just sent in his nomination for moment of the day! It comes off the bottom of Maxwell's blade as he looks to pull a short one outside off, and Neesham dives away to his left and picks up a one-handed grab. That's the kind of catch you would be tempted to take out for dinner, and take home to intro Boult to Khawaja, OUT GONE THIS TIME! Perfect full ball again, delivered at 137kph, and with a hint of reverse again back in from outside off. Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball. Vital half-century from Khawaja, though, as he acknowledges the crowd on his way out Boult to Starc, OUT OH YOU BEAUTY! We might get to see a bit of this from Starc later -- a perfect yorker, that swings in at good pace and goes under his blade even as he looks to jam it down. Almost as good as the ball that Starc delivered to Ben Stokes just a few days ago! Boult to Behrendorff, OUT HE'S GOT IT! Full, swinging away from him after pitching around leg, and given. Australia have reviewed this! It's a perfect full length, and there's no sign of bat near that. The only question could be where it pitched, I would think. The bat hits ground, but that is after the ball passes through and crashes into his right foot. It's out, and that's a hat-trick for Trent Boult! Ferguson to Warner, OUT short, and he has got Warner with a snorter! Delivered at 142kph, and following him as he looks to sway out of its way, this ball takes off and takes Warner along its way through to Latham. Ferguson had no doubt, and neither did Warner.

That's the kind of catch you would be tempted to take out for dinner, and take home to intro Williamson to Carey, OUT OUT THIS TIME! A terrific hand from Alex Carey comes to an end, as he looks to go inside out over cover but cannot clear Martin Guptill. Smart work, too, from KW, as he continues to get some purchase and grip from this surface. Nonetheless, this partnership has brought Australia right back into this contest Boult to Khawaja, 1 leg bye looks to flick a fuller delivery on leg stump to fine leg. But only ends up making contact with the pad Boult to Khawaja, OUT GONE THIS TIME! Perfect full ball again, delivered at 137kph, and with a hint of reverse again back in from outside off. Khawaja walks across to access the on side, but misses out on contact and in fact walks right outside the line of the ball.

Martin Guptill, who pull off possibly the catch of the tournament, is walking through the Long Room with Henry Nicholls, who is on World Cup debut and playing out of position. New Zealand would back themselves to chase this and get into the semis. But it won't be easy and that's not just because of Australia's bowling attack either. Lord's has rolled out a very sporting surface. Right, here's Jason Behrendorff with t Behrendorff to Guptill, 1 wide bowler overcompensates for the mistake and goes down the leg side Starc to Guptill, 1 wide goes searching for that inswinging delivery to take out Guptill's stumps. But the 145 kph veers off target Starc to Guptill, 1 leg bye half an appeal from Starc as he gets a length ball to curl back into Guptill at pace. The right-hander is trapped. His front foot is too far across and he doesn't have the time to adjust. Only height saves him. These are nervy times. Behrendorff to Williamson, 1 wide short, and too short according to the umpires. Also slanted away from him Behrendorff to Taylor, 1 wide slower ball, but sprays it down the leg side Starc to Williamson, OUT caught behind. One genius gets the other! And it's that dab. It's the go to shot. It's the one that feeds every one of his ODI innings. But not this one. The ball angling across the right hander - a cutter set up for the fourth slip - takes the edge as KW plays the dab and goes through to the keeper. Australia celebrate. Starc celebrates although should he reallly? He keeps taking so m Starc to Santner, 2 wide tries a short ball, but sprays it down the leg side, and will have to bowl this once again Lyon to Santner, 4 byes length, and he goes back and wants to pump this through midwicket. Gets close to the inside edge, and it beats Carey, the bat and the leg stump on its way through to the fine leg fence Starc to Santner, OUT short, and he holes out to fine leg! Starc has five, and Australia have crushed New Zealand in an imposing performance where they were on the back foot for the first hour and a bit in this contest. Cricket, bloody hell! It was short and quick, and Santner actually got inside the line of the ball and was looking to hook this towards long leg.

Came off the thigh pad! Stoinis to Williamson, SIX runs lifts it over deep midwicket. A length ball on leg stump and Williamson decides to show off a bit. Sure I could have nudged it along the ground to square leg. Buuuuuut.... I'd rather hit the first six of the day. There! Boom! Starc to Williamson, OUT caught behind. One genius gets the other!

On a decent run of form, with players coming back in who will strengthen them further. Know how to win a World Cup (or five). Plenty of observers warned the real Australia would turn up at this tournament, though fewer predicted they would be the first team to secure a semi-final place. But after brushing aside the early pace-setters in this round-robin format, Australia look increasingly - and menacingly - close to their best once again."
"9.58am Right, sit tight. The toss is coming up. And given the overheads, this flip of the coin could be half the battle won ... Meanwhile, there's another high-profile World Cup on across the English Channel, where some of the best teams in women's football are slugging it out for the title. What's attracting attention is not just the quality of play, but also conversations on gender equality 10.25am The players are out there for the anthems. Warner and Finch walk out to the middle. Woakes has the new ball from the Media Centre end. Finch on strike. Two slips in. Here we go ... Wood to Finch, 1 leg bye 147kph, short into the thigh pad and it rolls forward of square Ali to Finch, SIX runs pounded majestically over long-on! Woakes was back on the rope but that was belligerently nailed, leaning back, short arms, full power, pounded out of the arc and over the rope! Stokes to Khawaja, OUT bowled him! 90mph from Stokes, right into the blockhole, and Khawaja was simply beaten for pace as this shaped back in as he wafted rather loosely across the line. A vital incision to end a burgeoning stand Archer to Finch, OUT caught at fine leg! What has he done? A century and out. A high short ball, he was sucked into hooking, it was high and outside his eyeline, he gets a top edge that flies to fine leg and Woakes, after misfielding to concede his hundred, hangs on to the catch. Big blow landed by England Archer to Maxwell, SIX runs launched over wide long on! Goodness what a shot! Full in the slot, he just teed off, smoking this 97m over wide long on and into the crowd! Woakes to Cummins, OUT edged and taken by Buttler! Good delivery. Good length outside off, seam was wobbling, he drives without much footwork, it takes the edge and Buttler dives low to his right to hang on Archer to Carey, 1 wide full toss wide outside the guideline and called Stokes to Khawaja, OUT bowled him! 90mph from Stokes, right into the blockhole, and Khawaja was simply beaten for pace as this shaped back in as he wafted rather loosely across the line.

Good length outside off, seam was wobbling, he drives without much footwork, it takes the edge and Buttler dives low to his right to hang on Archer to Carey, 1 wide full toss wide outside the guideline and called Innings break 2.05pm Alex Carey's late flourish gives Australia something to bowl at. They made a mess of an outstanding start. Aaron Finch and David Warner were superb up front on a difficult pitch but neither could kick on to a big score. Finch got out for exactly 100. Warner made 53 and then the side fell away from there. 2.33pm So, out come England's openers, Jonny Bairstow and James Vince. Mitchell Starc, Australia's primary menace, was feeling his hamstring when batting at the end of their innings ... he's not taking the newest of new balls ... Jason Behrendorff has first dibs. Interesting... Behrendorff to Morgan, 1 wide fired past the leg stump Lyon to Buttler, 1 bye beaten on the inside edge! This gripped and bounced through the gate and over the stumps and Carey couldn't glove it cleanly. They get a bye Behrendorff to Woakes, OUT a massive wipe over the leg side, but what a catch! Woakes thought he had nailed it, in the arc, a huge heave, but Maxwell tracked back on the edge of the rope, hopped to pouch the ball high above his head, then, cool as you like, lobbed it back to the waiting Finch to complete a routine relay! England, as if you didn't already know it, are sunk without trace in this one! Behrendorff to Rashid, 1 leg bye leg-sided, Rashid rushes through for the single Behrendorff to Bairstow, 1 leg bye there is the inswinger, but it's on the pads. Can't clip it fine Stoinis to Buttler, 1 leg bye he skipped down to a 126kph cutter and was taken on the pad it rolls to midwicket. Stoinis appeal for LBW. It's not out. But after some lengthy conversation Finch reviews!. He was miles down the track and outside the line. Impact was well outside the line. Terrible review from Australia Stoinis to Stokes, 1 wide 114kph, slower ball dragged down the leg side Behrendorff to Woakes, OUT a massive wipe over the leg side, but what a catch! Woakes thought he had nailed it, in the arc, a huge heave, but Maxwell tracked back on the edge of the rope, hopped to pouch the ball high above his head, then, cool as you like, lobbed it back to the waiting Finch to complete a routine relay! England, as if you didn't already know it, are sunk without trace in this one! Behrendorff to Rashid, 1 leg bye leg-sided, Rashid rushes through for the single 6.02pm Wow. Behrendorff, five wickets. Starc, four wickets. Left-arm quicks, 9 for 87 all told! England have been yorker-ised in the World Cup Ashes showdown, and now their campaign really is on the ropes! 6.10pm Bharath Seervi has dug out the instances of nine wickets being shared by opening bowlers in a WC game. It's a rare feat, more usually achieved against, err, lesser teams 6.30pm Right, that's your lot for today. And to think last week, we were worried about the top four being locked out before the end of the round robin ... trust England to keep the group stages lively with their habitual chaos. It was like this in 2011 and 2015 too ... but they remain a vastly better team now than in either of those campaigns, in spite of appearances today. As for Australia, well, the defending champions have jus Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 285 for 7 (Finch 100, Warner 53, Woakes 2-46) beat England 221 (Stokes 89, Behrendorff 5-44, Starc 4-43) by 64 runs As it happened Australia played Test match cricket in miniature to get the better of England and a set of conditions at Lord's that were not really in the blueprint for Eoin Morgan's side ahead of a tournament in which they now face the tightest of ropes to qualify for the semi-finals. Australia, meanwhile, are now in the final four, the first team to get there. The cut and thrust of this Lord's ODI was a world away from the virtual home run derby of Trent Bridge a year ago. That day, England tallied a gargantuan 481 and seemingly set the tone for the way this World Cup would be played. Yet, in the crucible of a global tournament played in the damp of an early summer beset by rain, Australia's more deliberate plans, built on a stable, steady top order and a collective of pace and class with the ball have held up; the fireworks of Nottingham might as well have taken place on Mars."
"Mehidy Hasan Miraz to Warner, 1 wide drifting way down the leg side and called Rubel to Warner, 1 wide short of length but once again drifting down the leg side, another wide Soumya to Khawaja, 1 leg bye a huge shout for lbw but probably pitched outside leg. Was an offcutter on a length, Khawaja was moving across and looks to glance, misses. Gets a leg bye though Rubel to Warner, 1 wide 141kph, slung short down the leg side and called Shakib to Warner, SIX runs smacked 20 rows back over deep midwicket! This begged to be hit. A drag down short ball on leg, he set his base and clubbed it miles over deep midwicket Rubel to Warner, 1 leg bye attempted switch hit to a 139kph, full ball outside leg! It comes off pad for a leg bye Soumya to Warner, OUT lobs a catch to short third man! Soumya does it again! 115kph short slower ball, Warner tries to upper cut but there's no pace, he just lobs a catch to the man on the circle and Rubel takes an easy catch. Soumya to Khawaja, OUT caught behind! Soumya has been unbelievable! A surprise short ball, it comes off the pitch slowly, he tries to pull but is through the shot, gets a bottom edge off the toe of the bat, and Mushfiqur dives forward to take the catch! Mustafizur to Smith, OUT plumb LBW! Smith reviews for the sake of it but it was a full toss that hit him on the shin in front of middle. This is out. No bat. Ball tracking has it hitting the base of middle and off. The review is wasted. He went back and across and tried to whip it behind square and missed it. Australia might have left 20 out there despite superb innings from Khawaja and Finch as well. Maxwell's cameo could have been anything but a mix up and then Khawaja's dismissal stalled their innings late. Cummins to Tamim, OUT a Finch direct hit finds Soumya short at the bowler's end! A length ball around off, Tamim taps it towards the left of Finch at mid-on, calls for a single, is halfway down, Soumya responds a bit late but Tamim then turns back. Finch meanwhile slides to his left, his stronger hand, balances himself, sees which end to throw at and nails the direct hit t Coulter-Nile to Shakib, 1 wide starts with a length ball down the leg, needs to be bowled again Cummins to Shakib, 1 leg bye fuller on the leg stump, Shakib was moving towards the off side and misses the flick, gets a leg bye to fine leg. Think it pitched just outside the leg stump. Yes, way outside leg replays confirm Zampa to Mushfiqur, 1 wide leg break tossed wide of off, it spins sharply wide of the guideline and is called Starc to Mahmudullah, 1 leg bye length ball on the pads, Mahmudullah looks to glance it fine but fails to get any bat on it, a leg-bye as the ball rolls off the pads towards short fine leg Stoinis to Mushfiqur, 1 leg bye length ball down the leg side, goes for the sweep but misses, a leg bye to short fine leg Zampa to Mahmudullah, SIX runs length again, just around the off stumps, Mahmudullah skips down and lofts it over long-on, 95 metres Cummins to Mushfiqur, 1 wide length ball, Cummins sees Mushfiqur backing away and bowls wide outside off, too wide deems the umpire Cummins to Mahmudullah, 1 wide fuller and wider outside off, once again too wide. 100 of the stand comes up off just 83 balls That's all from our side, folks. Thanks for joining us. See you tomorrow. Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 381 for 5 (Warner 166, Khawaja 89, Finch 53, Soumya 3-58) beat Bangladesh 333 (Mushfiqur 102*, Mahmudullah 69, Tamim 62) by 48 runs Crowds of people left Trent Bridge. They think it's all over, and it probably is now. Australia battered Bangladesh with the bat and then squeezed them slowly but surely with the ball to complete a victory that more or less settled the top four places for the World Cup semi-finals, with near enough to three more weeks of qualifying games remaining. Alongside England, India and New Zealand, Australia are firmly ensconced in the semi-final placings, seeing off a Bangladesh team who, by dint of their sparkling displays against South Africa and the West Indies, had been the last of the genuine challengers from outside the top quartet. There was plenty to like about the day's cricket in Nottingham, from a powerful century by David Warner, nifty support from Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja, a brief but spectacular display by Glenn Maxwell, and plenty of doughtiness about the chase for a distant target, earning Mushfiqur Rahim an unbeaten century and Bangladesh their highest ever ODI total."
"Perera to Warner, 1 wide short and wide, 130kph, way too wide of off and called Dhananjaya to Warner, OUT bowled him! Well bowled from Dhananjaya. Warner got in a tangle. It was a good length, drifting in and skidding on, Warner pressed forward initially, then pressed back to give room to cut but it was too full and it crashed into middle Dhananjaya to Khawaja, OUT first Warner, now Khawaja and Sri Lanka back in this! This is nicely tossed up, drifting in from around the stumps, Khawaja looks to sweep - takes him on with the short boundary in sight - hits it well but picks out Udana at deep midwicket. Massive blow. Dhananjaya to Finch, SIX runs again! Thumped. Absolutely thumped. Too full, right into his swinging arc, Finch ain't gonna miss out. He's warmed up properly. No spin, no drift, angles in and boom! Malinga to Smith, 1 wide slower bouncer outside off, way over the batsman's head, wide called and rightly so Siriwardana to Finch, 1 leg bye sliding down, Finch gets some pad on this as it rolls to short fine leg, quick single. In fact leg byes called Malinga to Smith, 1 wide Smith walked at Malinga who fires a slower ball miles down leg Udana to Marsh, OUT caught at deep midwicket! Well bowled! Back of the hand slower ball, outside off, he tries to heave this to the long boundary at deep midwicket, doesn't get it and Siriwardana takes the catch easily 10m inside the rope Malinga to Smith, OUT bowled him with a cracking yorker! The clock says 130kph but that looked quicker. Smith tried to whip this behind square but it slid under the bat and hit the outside of off stump. Vintage Lasith! Udana to Cummins, OUT another direct hit from Udana! This is superb! He nails the yorker, Cummins digs it out on the on side and takes off, Udana whips across like a leopard, Cummins is sent back by Maxwell, Udana gathers, steadies, fires and hits with Cummins miles out at the striker's end! Maxwell to Dimuth, 1 wide slips this down leg, wide called as Dimuth looks to tickle this fine with the angle. Kane Richardson to Dimuth, OUT caught at backward point! Oh no! Three short of a magical hundred. It was short and wide, there to cut for four, but he just guided it, didn't try and get over the top of it or hit it up and over Maxwell at backward point. He picked him out. Catching practice for Maxwell. What a massive blow that is Starc to Mendis, SIX runs thumped back over the bowler's head! Off Starc no less! Mid off and mid on were up, this was up in the slot and he swings through the line and crushes it straight at the sight screen. What a shot. Starc to Siriwardana, 1 wide slips this length ball down leg, wide called. Kane Richardson to Dhananjaya, 1 wide slower and fuller, backs and leaves. Bizarre? Thanks for joining us. Great fun today. The first 15 overs of Sri Lanka's innings was as entertaining as any passage so far this World Cup. Pretty sure there's plenty more coming on Sunday. It's India v Pakistan. Hope you've planned out your day in front of the TV and of course with us here on ESPNcricinfo. Trust me, your second-screen experience will be as good, if not better. For now, head o Player of the match is Aaron Finch, AUS","Australia 334 for 7 (Finch 153, Smith 73, Maxwell 46) beat Sri Lanka 247 (Karunaratne 97, Kusal Perera 52, Starc 4-55) by 87 runs As it happened Australia's best stuff, personified by Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Starc, looked world-beating against Sri Lanka at The Oval. Yet there were still signs that Finch's team have plenty of kinks to iron out, not least problems in an unbalanced batting order but also the continued reliance of the bowling attack on Starc and Pat Cummins, currently first and second on the tournament wickets table. There were times, when Finch, Smith and Maxwell were in full flight, and when Starc helped cut Sri Lanka down from 186 for 2 to their final tally of 247, when the Australians appeared irresistible; indeed, this win took them to the top of the competition table. But these moments were interspersed with issues that seem hard to fathom from a team contending for a World Cup, such as how Shaun Marsh ends up trying to start a top-order innings in the final five overs, and why Australia persist in ignoring Nathan Lyon as their best fourth-bowling option. WATCH on Hotstar (India only): Match highlights At some point in this tournament these issues will rear, as they did against India, also at The Oval, but Sri Lanka were neither confident nor accomplished enough to take advantage of the opportunities afforded them by Australian blind spots."
"Shaheen Shah Afridi to Finch, 1 wide 139kph, shorter and swinging down leg and rightly called wide Amir to Warner, 1 wide 133kph, wide of the crease, angled down the leg side and a wide Shaheen Shah Afridi to Finch, 1 leg bye 140kph, good length on leg, he's taken on the thigh guard, it's high and not hitting the stumps, it rolls behind square for a leg bye Wahab Riaz to Warner, 1 wide full and speared down the leg side Hafeez to Finch, SIX runs spanked with insolence over cow corner! Hard, flat, pelted over the short boundary! Hasan Ali to Warner, 1 wide round the wicket, speared down the leg side. It's not happening for Pakistan today Malik to Warner, SIX runs leans back, hauls a freebie pull high over long-on! It plops over the rope, into and out of the hands of a Pakistani spectator ... standards are low either side of the rope today ... Shaheen Shah Afridi to Maxwell, OUT Bowled him! 141kph, full and straight and through the gaping gate! That's why you need pace to Maxwell. His feet were anchored, he was hanging back but exposing middle and off, he played outside the line, it went straight through the wide gate between bat and pad and crashed into the stumps! Shaheen Shah Afridi to Warner, OUT caught at deep point! Imam holds on finally! This was fuller outside off, Warner tried to launch it down the ground, he sliced it high off a thick outside edge, it flew very high to deep point, Imam came in off the rope and takes the catch clutching it to his chest Shaheen Shah Afridi to Marsh, 1 leg bye 141kph, angled into leg, it takes him on the pad and rolls behind square for a leg bye Hasan Ali to Khawaja, 1 wide 132kph, pushed way wide of off, too wide for Khawaja to reach Amir to Marsh, OUT caught at long off by Shoaib! Amir again! Cross seam delivery, length on off, he tried to launch it over long on, he got under it as it stopped in the surface a touch, he skied it to long on, Shoaib is in from the rope and takes a comfortable catch Amir to Khawaja, OUT caught at mid off! It was a full length, it just stops in the surface a touch, he drives in the air straight to Wahab on the circle at mid off and he clutches onto it awkwardly! He held it and that's all that matters Wahab Riaz to Coulter-Nile, OUT caught behind off the inside edge! Good catch by Sarfaraz low to his left. It was full outside off, Coulter-Nile had it feet anchored and played for more tail across, it held it's line, caught the inside edge, just missed off stump but Sarfaraz was sharp moving low to his left to claim it Hasan Ali to Cummins, OUT caught behind! 134kph but this rears off a length and catches the gloves on the way through to the keeper! Good short ball, Cummins was surprised, tried to lean back and cut but the bounce and pace was too much, it comes off the gloves and an easy catch for the skipper Amir to Carey, OUT LBW! Superb yorker! Carey reviews. It was full and tailed into the front shoe, he got it out of the way but it hit the back pad infront of leg. No bat involved by the looks. Nothing on ultra edge. Ball tracking says ... OUT. Pitched in line, hitting in line, smashing leg stump! Good decision. Even better bowling. Readers in India, while you wait for Pakistan to come out to bat, fancy having a look at that Warner innings once again? Here are the highlights, on Hotstar. 2.06pm Innings break Australia bowled out with six balls to go for 307 after they were 2 for 223 with 16 overs to go. Amir was outstanding. He pegged Australia back single handedly after David Warner's outstanding century. Coulter-Nile to Babar Azam, OUT short, and slapped straight to Richardson on the fence! That's a body blow! Babar's drives alone were going to win this game at a canter. But he's lured into a response to the bouncer, and doesn't come close to getting his wrists over the ball. Dragged down from way over his head like an amateur fly-fisherman, and backward square is in business again Kane Richardson to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 wide 130kph, angled well down the leg side and called wide Starc to Imam-ul-Haq, 1 wide 147kph, but slanting down the leg side and called wide Coulter-Nile to Hafeez, 1 wide 127kph, short and swinging too wide of off and rightly called Coulter-Nile to Wahab Riaz, SIX runs six more, heaved over cow corner! Sweetly struck, Pakistan getting a moooooooove on now! Starc to Wahab Riaz, OUT beats the bat, Wahab poking at it off the back foot, Carey and Starc like it! Not given by umpire Palliyaguruge, but Australia review with one second left on the countdown! Fencing off the back foot, well away from the body, if there was a sound it must have been bat... and there's a line on Ultra Edge! That's the breakthrough, Starc prises one out! Huge relief for Finch, who Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 307 (Warner 107, Finch 82, Amir 5-30) beat Pakistan 266 (Imam 53, Cummins 3-33) by 41 runs Watch on Hotstar (India only) - Match highlights A wild, seesawing game that always seemed just a little too far out of Pakistan's reach proved to be just that at the end, with Australia wrapping up a 41-run victory that was far nervier than the scorecard suggested. It came about thanks to a century from David Warner at the top end, coupled with generosity to the point of self-sacrifice from Pakistan both with the ball and in the field. Australia were so far on top in the first half of the first innings, talk of 350 and 400 rolled easily off the tongue, until a vintage performance from Mohammad Amir curtailed them to 307, his five-for bowling out a side that hadn't lost a single wicket for 22 overs. Pakistan, in response, oscillated between dismal and distinguished. Babar Azam looked princely for a knock that lasted all of 28 deliveries, before an 80-run partnership between Imam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Hafeez looked to have put Pakistan on top."
"Starc to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye very full and darting into the pads, Starc cranks up to 144ks, but no swing for him yet. Tucked away towards square leg off the back foot Starc to S Dhawan, 1 leg bye full, on middle and angling into his pads. Tries to give this a whip over the leg side, but the ball hits his pads instead Coulter-Nile to Rohit Sharma, OUT first wicket! Length ball outside off, rising off the deck, and Rohit tries fishing for it. Takes the outside edge, and Carey moves swiftly to his left right to half-dive and complete the catch Cummins to Kohli, 1 wide length ball, on middle, and angling down leg. Virat is furious at himself for missing out on a pull Stoinis to S Dhawan, 1 wide bouncer, sails over the head, as Dhawan sways out of the way. Wide called Starc to S Dhawan, OUT Starc misses his yorker again, goes too full on middle and leg. Dhawan ventures an almighty hoick, gets more height as opposed to distance - these are bigger boundaries anyway - and holes out to deep midwicket. End of an excellent innings nevertheless. It has put India on top Cummins to Hardik, SIX runs straight over the non-striker! Full, on off, and he offers his bat's full face to earn another six. Wasn't a bad ball at all Cummins to Hardik, 1 wide full and wide outside off stump. And going further away Cummins to Hardik, OUT low full toss, outside off stump ,and he slices this to cover. Excellent pinch-hitting Starc to Kohli, SIX runs full outside off, and Kohli plays a stunning lofted drive over cover, and my oh my, this has gone over the boundary! Exquisite Stoinis to Dhoni, OUT catch of the tournament? Low full toss outside off, and Dhoni had flat-batted this straight, but Stoinis sticks his right-hand out to take a stunning reaction catch Stoinis to Rahul, SIX runs full toss on middle, and he swipes this off his hips over deep midwicket. What a ball to receive first up Stoinis to Kohli, 1 wide length ball, very wide outside off stump. Wide Stoinis to Kohli, OUT length ball, outside off stump, and Kohli tries to slap a cut over point. But it's not in the gap, and the person in the deep comfortably takes this catch Okay, Finch and Warner walk down the stairs and into the middle. The Indians, meanwhile, get into a huddle. Dhoni's gloves are in the spotlight. He will be wearing a new pair of gloves today without the dagger emblem. Bhuvneshwar has the new ball. Watch out Finch. But, it is Warner who'll take first strike. Let's go again Hardik to Finch, 1 wide lifter outside off, too high and that's a wide Bumrah to Warner, 1 leg bye Warner, standing on leg stump, shuffles across off stump and deflects a slower variation through square leg Jadhav to Smith, SIX runs tossed outside off, Smith dashes down the track, gets closer to the pitch, and launches it over midwicket Hardik to Khawaja, 1 bye back of a length, on leg stump, and he tries to pull but gets cramped up. Goes through to Dhoni. A proper short ball this Chahal to Maxwell, OUT Chahal gets rid of Maxwell (again). This was pushed through on middle, Maxwell dares to slog-sweep against the break. He is beaten in flight and does not get all of it. He splices a top edge. Jadeja tears in from deep midwicket and completes an excellent tumbling catch. He isn't in the XI today - but is making an impact as sub. 6.43pmSo, India secure their second successive victory this World Cup. It was set up by Dhawan who cracked 117 off 109 balls before mighty blows from Pandya, Kohli, Rahul and Dhoni propelled India past 350. Australia had a rather sluggish start; Warner laboured to his slowest ODI fifty. Fifty of Warner's 84 balls were dots. Smith made a more fluent fifty and Player of the match is Shikhar Dhawan, INDIA","India 352 for 5 (Dhawan 117, Kohli 82, Rohit 57, Hardik 48, Cummins 1-55) beat Australia 316 (Smith 69, Warner 56, Carey 55*, Bhuvneshwar 3-50) by 36 runs As it happened There was a masterclass in batting at The Oval. Shikhar Dhawan overcame a weakness to score 117. Steven Smith showed none as he made 69. Hardik Pandya was pure unfettered power. David Warner fought demons."
"10.00am Toss - West Indies won the toss and will bowl first. Thomas to Finch, OUT caught behind! Cracking delivery! Good length, angled in towards off stump, he's forced to defend half forward, it nipped off the seam, scratched the outside edge and a simple catch for Hope! What a beautiful piece of fast bowling! That first over is a distant memory now! Thomas to Khawaja, 1 wide 143kph, lifting delivery down leg, he went to glance and withdrew the bat, it's a wide but there's a plan Cottrell to Warner, 1 wide 141kph, bouncer outside off but too high and called wide Cottrell to Warner, OUT caught at backward point! He was hanging back a touch because of the bouncer, it was a length ball wide, he tried to square drive on the up, didn't get on top of the bounce and just bunted a catch to Hetmyer at backward point who is in quite close! Cottrell salutes! Thomas to Khawaja, 1 bye beaten by one that nips away off the seam, Hope fumbles the take and allows a bye Russell to Khawaja, OUT caught behind! A screamer from Hope! A one hander! The short barrage unsettled him. This was full angled across, he backed away to try and drive on the up, got a thick edge, Hope dived full length to his left in front of first and plucked it one handed! It would not have carried to Gayle at slip! Superb stuff from the Windies! Cottrell to Maxwell, OUT skied straight up! Caught by Hope! Maxwell out pulling second ball! This was another excellent bouncer, very high and well directed, he tried to pull and skied it straight up, Hope wanders underneath it and takes a simple catch! Another salute from Sheldon. Russell to Smith, 1 wide shorter length, 141kph, angled down leg and called wide Russell to Smith, 1 wide bouncer, too high and called wide Brathwaite to Smith, 1 wide angled way down the leg side and called wide Holder to Stoinis, OUT sucker ball snares a wicket for the captain! Holder bowled it a touch short on off stump angling into Stoinis. It sat up there for him waiting to be spanked but Stoinis neither rolls the wrists over it nor gets requisite elevation to clear Nicholas Pooran in the ring at midwicket. Straight to him at chest height. West Indies rollicking start with the ball continues. Thomas to Coulter-Nile, 1 wide 138kph, sprayed way down the leg side Thomas to Smith, OUT Cottrell with a screamer! No turf trolls eating him up this time at long leg! Fullish length on a fifth stump line. Smith shuffles across once more to flick this high over backward square, Cottrell made an absolute mess of a chance on 26 in an identical slot, this time sprints along the rope 20 yards moving left at full speed and stabs at it with his left hand, knifing it out of the air, then flicks it up before stepping over the rope before reclaiming it after reestablishing himself inside the field of Cottrell to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs dropped! Very harsh but it did ricochet off Brathwaite's hand at deep square leg and then hit the rope on the full for six. Shortish length on off stump, Coulter-Nile laces a scorching pull toward Brathwaite at deep square leg, just evades his grasp running to his left and sliding at the last moment. After the take that Cottrell just had in the previous over, the fans and teammate's must be wondering why Brathwaite couldn't match him! But it was 10/10 on the degree of difficulty scale. Cottrell to Coulter-Nile, SIX runs highest score now by a No. 8 in a World Cup! In the slot outside off, drives through the line 15 yards into the stands over long-on. Brathwaite to Cummins, OUT slower bouncer, Cummins struggles keeping his hands back going to pull, skies it to deep square leg, Cottrell settles under it 10 yards in from the rope. This was 3/10 on the difficulty scale compared to the absurd one-hander he took to dismiss Smith. Brathwaite to Coulter-Nile, OUT Coulter-Nile falls four short of breaking the record for a No. 8 in ODIs! It was in the slot outside off, he went for glory trying to clear Holder at wide long-off but got under it just a bit too much. The bat turned on connection too so wasn't timed as well as he wanted. In the air for awhile before coming down to the West Indies captain three yards inside the rope. Brathwaite to Starc, OUT Brathwaite rewarded for pitching it up again, in the slot on off, Starc tried to heave it over Holder at wide long-on but didn't get under it enough and the tallest man on the field has no issues claiming this one roving left a few yards inside the rope at chest height. In spite of that earlier misjudged chance by Cottrell, he made up for it later with this stunner to finally claim Smith at deep fine leg. Watch Sheldon Cottrell's sensational catch on the boundary. It came after Smith and Alex Carey initially led Australia's fightback to dig out of a major hole at 79 for 5. Watch how Smith and Carey put Australia back in the game (UK, IRE, AUS only). 2.18 pm Australia end an over short, but a brilliant fightback nonetheless led by Smith and Coulter-Nile. West Indies paid for some inconsistent fielding though. Smith arguably should have been caught at deep fine leg on 26 but Cottrell misjudged the chance and Coulter-Nile was also grassed on a much simpler effort by Hetmyer on 61 at deep midwicket. The wides were also costly too, releasing the pressure after West Indies had Australia under the pump. Can West Indies chase this down? See what our MatchDay studio panel has to say. Gayle and Lewis walk out to open the chase. Starc over the stumps to Gayle with two slips in place. West Indies were favorites on the UK high street oddsmakers from the fifth wicket through the majority of the rest of the innings, but that Coulter-Nile rearguard has put Australia at 4/5 at the start of this chase to defend 288, for people into that kind of thing.... Starc to Gayle, 1 wide short and wide outside off, too wide to play. Starc to Hope, 1 wide short and well down leg, Carey does well to save it from being five wides. Starc to Gayle, OUT stone dead this time around! Starc couldn't pierce Gayle with the yorker on the previous ball but this time around Gayle is late getting the bat down on an 86 mph delivery pitching very full and hitting him low on the shin in front of middle. After waiting 12 seconds while chatting with Hope, Gayle finally calls for the review.... Ball-tracking confirms it was clipping leg-stump on umpire's call. Three strikes (on DRS) and you're out! West Indies retain their review though. Cummins to Hope, 1 wide bouncer, wide called on height. Cummins to Hope, 1 wide bouncer again, another wide called. Stoinis to Pooran, SIX runs hooked fine off the top edge for six! This was a well directed bouncer, he hooked but got a top edge, fine leg is square and it carried all the way for six Zampa to Russell, SIX runs lift-off for Dre Russ! Floated full on off, Russell winds up and scorches this into the stands a good 20 rows back over long-on into the second tier. West Indies were in a series of winning positions in both innings but couldn't slam the door shut. The defending champions showed their mettle to keep fighting back before coming out on top. Along with the England v Pakistan match, this is right near the top of the heap in terms of the best contest of the tournament so far. Pleasure to have you join us for the ride. For Alex Malcolm, Ranjith and the rest of the scoring team, I'm Peter Della Penna. Make sure to come back tomorrow for live coverage of the showdown in Bristol between Player of the match is Nathan Coulter-Nile, AUS","Australia 288 (Coulter Nile 92, Smith 73, Brathwaite 3-67) beat West Indies 273 for 9 (Hope 68, Holder 51, Starc 5-46) by 15 runs As it happened Nottingham is where, for most of recent history, Australian teams have come to die. They fell narrowly short in a 2013 Test match, before being destroyed by the swinging ball on a crazed morning in 2015, then beaten to a pulp by England's batsmen in an ODI last year. Against West Indies they seemed destined for a similar fate, losing four early wickets as the ball pranced, swung and reared at helmets and throats. Somehow, though, Aaron Finch's men scrounged their way to a 10th consecutive ODI victory, something achieved through a combination of efforts that will please the coach Justin Langer no end. For all their top order woes, the Australians were resourceful in adversity."
"Hosein to Philippe, OUT Philippe throws his wicket away after a solid start. It was a good ball from Hosein that needed to be respected with a simple forward defense but instead Philippe gets carried away backing away trying to cut and leaves his stumps very exposed. He mistimes the shot and drags on with a bottom edge. Joseph to Marsh, OUT big appeal for a catch down leg given not out! Looked like it came off the face of the bat or glove on the live shot. And Pollard goes for the review. Before they can even go to the third umpire, Marsh starts walking off, he knows he's hit it! Sharp take by Pooran diving down leg on this back of a length ball. Snicko shows it did indeed come off the open bat face. He was playing well away from his body so it could only have been an edge on the live camera shot down the pitch. Not sure what umpire Joel Wilson was looking at to think it could have come off the pad or thigh guard inst Joseph to McDermott, OUT edged, taken at slip! More reward for Joseph. Back of a length outside off, hint of away movement, McDermott playing well away from his body. A healthy edge and neatly grabbed at the lone slip. Reward for keeping the catch in Joseph to Carey, 1 wide pushed wide outside off to the left hander and called Holder to Turner, SIX runs back of the hand slower ball at 108 kph lands way too short on fifth stump, sits up there for Turner to clobber over wide long-on, over the rope and the fence as well 10 yards beyond. Walsh to Carey, OUT Walsh Jr gets a just reward for a disciplined spell! Flighted full on leg stump, tosses up to encourage a big heave with the spin over midwicket but the ball has been slow off the pitch all day and the lack of bounce coming onto the bat means Carey is through the shot a touch early and it beats the bat to clang into leg stump three-quarters of the way up. Walsh to Starc, OUT googly again lands short outside leg stump, another top edge pull against the spin as Starc tries to heave this over square leg but instead it climbs on him with a touch of extra bounce and swirls over backward square leg. Hosein jogs under it casually 10 yards inside the rope and clutches on reaching in front of his body at waist height. Walsh to Wade, OUT another googly. Another top edge! Another catch on the leg side rope! Walsh Jr pitches this one even shorter than the one he bowled to Starc a ball earlier, Wade rocks back very early but once more the pull shot against the turn does not come off the middle of the bat. It hangs in the air for some time toward Hetmyer coming in 15 yards off the rope at deep midwicket for a simple chest height catch. Walsh to Agar, 1 wide, OUT clever from Walsh Jr! Saw Agar charging and bowled this very wide outside the guidelines. Pooran was prepared for it and collected to get the bails off sharply. Wide called but they get the wicket. Maiden ODI five-for by Walsh Jr! He wasn't even in the named squad but thanks to his Player of the Series performance in the T20Is, he gets brought in and rewards Kieron Pollard's faith in him. Interesting stat on Hayden Walsh Jr. In 15 matches for USA in 50-over cricket during his career for them from 2018 to 2019, he never took more than two wickets in a match and finished with a total of nine wickets in his one-day career for them. His best was 2 for 24 against Oman at World Cricket League Division Three in November 2018. It shows how much his legspin has developed in the last 24 months where he has been utilized as a specialist bowler in the West Indies setup compared to when he was more of a batting allrounder playing for USA. 7.11 pm A half-century from stand-in captain Carey on his captaincy debut for Australia. But a lot of wasted starts otherwise on what was a two-paced pitch. Hard to score but also hard to get out. Walsh Jr though bowled very disciplined in his initial spell before finally getting the rewards at the death, taking a maiden ODI five-wicket haul with all five wickets all falling in his final three overs at the death. Still, this may be a bit difficult to chase down on a tricky and inconsistent wicket that has offered plenty of spin and turn for the slow bowlers too. Stay with us for the chase, which again will be Hetmyer out to open the batting with Shai Hope absent injured from this match due to an ankle injury. Evin Lewis opening as per usual. Starc has the new ball in hand. Slight delay as two golf carts drag a rope around the outfield to soak up some moisture. Hazlewood to Hetmyer, OUT another leading edge back to the bowler! West Indies batters still not adjusting to the sticky/two-paced nature of this wicket. Another full ball on leg stump, Hetmyer through his flick early and Hazlewood's eyes light up seeing this float back to his left at a very gentle pace. He changes his direction enough to get within arm's length to pluck this one-handed with his left hand at chest height. If Hazlewood had to he could have gone two-handed but it was coming back at a slow enough pace that he took the casual approach and clutched on with ease. Starc to Pooran, OUT full on middle and leg, Pooran late on a flick and is pinged on the pads. Huge lbw shout upheld. Pooran goes for the review but this is not going to be overturned. He was hit very full on middle and leg. Only a prayer on ball-tracking will take this past leg stump. Sure enough ball-tracking shows it was clipping leg stump. Umpire's call is what shows up on the screen. On-field call stands. He was falling across his stumps with his head unbalanced. Starc continues to be a menace in this spell by attacking that middle and leg stump line. Zampa to Pollard, SIX runs flights this googly full on fourth stump, Pollard slaughters this high and deep over wide long-on, this time clearing it all the way into the grandstand. He didn't middle it by any stretch but raw strength ensures it carries for maximum value. Agar to Joseph, 1 wide a bouncer, 134kph, ducks underneath and it's called wide on height Marsh to Pollard, 1 leg bye fuller, in at the pads, an appeal for lbw as Pollard misses his flick but that look comfortably leg side Marsh to Joseph, 1 wide full and down the leg side Marsh to Walsh, 1 wide short of a length down the leg side, the umpire ponders and then calls wide Australia move up to sole possession of third in the World Cup Super League table, having claimed 50 out of a possible 70 points from their seven matches so far. West Indies remain tied for seventh with New Zealand and Afghanistan on 30 points. However, Afghanistan and New Zealand have both taken three from three while West Indies have only won three of seven games in the Super League thus far. 10.08 pm So Hayden Walsh Jr's maiden ODI five-for winds up in vain as Mitchell Starc's new-ball bonanza, including a wicket off the first ball of the chase, ends in his eighth ODI five-for to demolish the West Indies top order at 27 for 6 and paves the way for a lopsided end result. Only captain Kieron Pollard's 56 off 57 balls spared the hosts from being bowled out for double-digits. Alex Carey wins on his Australia ODI captaincy debut standing in for Aaron Finch. Ten points scooped up by Australia in the World Cup Super League points table is a solid start after being dominated in the T20I series that prece Player of the match is Mitchell Starc, AUS","Australia 252 for 9 (Carey 67, Turner 49, Walsh Jr 5-39) beat West Indies 123 (Pollard 56, Starc 5-48, Hazlewood 3-11) by 133 runs (DLS method) Mitchell Starc took a five-wicket haul as he and Josh Hazlewood dismantled West Indies in the opening ODI to give Alex Carey, who had earlier played a key hand with the bat, a winning start as Australia's ODI captain. Carey, standing in for the injured Aaron Finch, had formed the backbone of Australia's innings with Ashton Turner in a fifth-wicket stand of 104 in 19 overs before Hayden Walsh Jr sparked a late collapse with a career-best five-wicket haul. However, Australia's 252 - which was adjusted to a target of 257 after three rain interruptions cut the match to 49 overs - quickly looked imposing as Starc and Hazlewood got to work with the new ball to leave West Indies in a heap at 27 for 6. Starc took three wickets in his first spell and then returned to end the aggressive rearguard of Kieron Pollard. Pollard hit a 41-ball fifty, but the West Indies captain had been left with far too much ground to regain."
"5.40pm Toss Sri Lanka has won the toss and will bat first. Kane Richardson to Mendis, 1 wide 133kph, shaping way down the leg side and called wide Stanlake to Gunathilaka, OUT Bowled him! Just knocked off the off bail! This was a good length, Gunathilaka backed away and tried swing this down the ground, he missed completely and it just knocked the bail off the stumps. Stanlake to Perera, 1 leg bye 143kph, shorter length into the hip, it comes off the thigh guard to short fine Stanlake to Shanaka, OUT big appeal for catch behind and a late signal from the umpire. Shanaka is caught down the leg side and he isn't going to review. A steep short ball starting at a middle stump line and going down leg. He has a swish at it from underneath and can only manage to get the high part of this outside edge on it. Quick feet from Carey before he holds on comfortably Cummins to Udana, OUT top edge straight out to deep square. Full speed short ball this time, up at his throat. He's on the front foot and has a swat at it with no control. Richardson hangs on low in front Zampa to Malinga, OUT stumped next ball. Fuller and flatter and wider outside off. A slider, it appears. He steps out and gets too far leg side of it to make contact 7.59pm The players are out in the middle. Warner and Finch hoping to pick up where they left off in Adelaide. Udana to Smith, 1 wide 103kph, slower ball, dragged way down leg and called wide Pradeep to Warner, 1 wide short ball pushed across off stump. Lets that go Pradeep to Warner, 1 leg bye slower ball at a length on leg stump. Looks to flick and he's beaten. Caught right in front of the stumps on the back thigh and a big appeal...and then a late decision to review the not out call. Did that pitch in line? He's bowling from over the wicket...no, pitching outside leg. Decision stands 9:05pm Australia go up 2-0, which means they've sealed a series win with seven overs to spare. Nothing really improved for Sri Lanka today. The difference in quality was just as wide as it was in the first game. The decisions from their batsmen didn't improve, the bowling wasn't all that better and there were poor moments on the field as well. For Australia, a minor glitch - Finch caught down leg side 9:18pm And that is all from us tonight. See you again for the final T20I. Australia won by 9 wickets (with 42 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 118 for 1 (Warner 60*, Smith 53*) beat Sri Lanka 117 (Kusal Perera 27, Zampa 2-20, Stanlake 2-23) by nine wickets At least there were no unwanted records this time. At least the team total broke through to triple figures. And at least two batsmen made more than 20. Having been thumped by 134 runs on Sunday, these were the only minor improvements for Sri Lanka in the second T20I. Yet again, however, they were emphatically outplayed from the very beginning."
"1.30pm Sri Lanka have won the toss and will bowl first. Malinga to Warner, 1 wide Warner walks at him, it is slung down the leg side and called wide Rajitha to Finch, SIX runs launched over square leg! 50 for Finch in style! Fuller length on middle and he picks up the length and launches it over square leg into the stands Sandakan to Finch, OUT taken at deep midwicket and the mayhem is broken (for now, at least)! Looks to go over deep midwicket again, just gets too far underneath it this time, and had to reach a little, Mendis settles well under the catch Sandakan to Warner, 2 wide pushed down the leg side, Warner misses the sweep and it's a wide as well Hasaranga de Silva to Maxwell, SIX runs that's HUGE as Maxwell slog-sweeps with immense power over (well over) deep midwicket and into the second tier of the stands Shanaka to Maxwell, OUT given caught behind off an inside edge as he looks to flick away a full delivery and Maxwell has called the review. Yep, he's inside-edge this between his legs to the keeper! A very Maxwell way to get out, the end of a brilliant innings. Kane Richardson to Fernando, 1 wide too short and wide of off and rightly called Starc to Shanaka, 1 leg bye that hits him on the helmet, I think, as the bouncer his through him too quickly as he goes for the pull...yep, flush on the side of the lid Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 2 for 233 (Warner 100*, Finch 64, Maxwell 62) beat Sri Lanka 9 for 99 ( Shanaka 17, Zampa 3-14) by 134 runs A yawning victory for Australia, a pugilistic century for David Warner, Steven Smith not even required to bat? Do not adjust your browsers. Aaron Finch's team set down a brutal marker for the start of their 12-month run to next year's Twenty20 World Cup by swatting Sri Lanka aside with their highest-ever total on home soil and fourth highest overall, as the captain and a promoted Glenn Maxwell provided the perfect complement to Warner's triumphant return home after a nightmarish tour of England. Smith, the single biggest reason for Australia's Ashes retention, was listed to bat at No. 3 but found himself demoted below Maxwell and Ashton Turner in recognition of their relative hitting power. But on a day where the bowlers followed up by holding the decidedly underwhelming visitors for a mere 9 for 99, in the process securing the home side's biggest ever T20I winning margin and Sri Lanka's biggest ever T20I defeat, the lack of reliance upon Smith augured well for the rest of Australia's summer."
"4pm Toss Aaron Finch has won the toss and Australia will bowl first. Starc to Babar Azam, 1 wide 140kph, fired down the leg side and called wide Starc to Babar Azam, 1 wide swinging way down the leg side and rightly called wide again. Carey has to dive a long way Starc to Babar Azam, OUT Given out LBW. He's been given and Babar reviews. This was full and shaping into the pad late. There was a big appeal and it carried to slip. There's no bat involved. Nothing on hot spot. RTS appears to say pad only. Daylight between bat and ball. Ball tracking is a little slow. We have to wait 30 seconds for ball tracking. Ball tracking s Starc to Rizwan, OUT Bowled him! Searing 140kph inswinger! This was like a heat-seeking missile. Started on off, swung late through a gaping gate as he tried to drive away from his body. His pads were outside leg, his bat outside off, the ball swerved through and crashed into middle and leg Abbott to Imam-ul-Haq, OUT top edge caught at midwicket! Short ball banged in outside off, he tries to pull but goes from low to high with his hands, gets a top edge that flies straight up to midwicket, McDermott camps under it and takes the catch very easily. That was a poorly executed stroke Kane Richardson to Khushdil, OUT this won't help improve their mood! Khushdil cleared his front leg and looked to tonk this into the stands behind midwicket. It went so high the keeper thought he might catch it, but in the end Starc at fine leg got himself into position and snared a swirling one. Pakistan lose half their side. Abbott to Imad Wasim, OUT gone! What a catch! Agar can't put a foot wrong today. Not a surprise, in truth. Nothing had been working for Imad in the short time he' Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, OUT massive blow for Pakistan! Heaved down to fine leg from Iftikhar. He'd been struggling with the short ball for much of the innings, and Starc at fine leg was secure as ever. Richardson, who copped such heavy punishment from Iftikhar last game, get's his revenge Kane Richardson to Shadab, no run swing and a miss. Shadab one off six now. Needs to kick on badly Kane Richardson to Shadab, OUT the miserable innings comes to an end! Well, colour me surprised! Shadab had been struggling badly all eight balls he was there, and this time, he got a thick edge. Mid-on made a bit of a meal of it, but that's it for the allrounder Starc to Amir, 1 wide dragged down legside Stanlake to Haris Sohail, 1 wide 140kph, bouncer, down the leg side and called wide Agar to Haris Sohail, OUT caught at long off! That was brilliant from Agar. Haris jumped down early, Agar dragged the length down, Haris went through with the shot, mistimed it trying to launch over long off, he clothed it straight down Richardson's throat at long off. Easy catch 15 metres in off the rope Amir to Finch, 1 wide 135kph, good length, but swinging down the leg side again Amir to Warner, 1 wide 135kph, predictable bouncer and it's too high Mohammad Hasnain to Warner, 1 wide 145kph, angled down the leg side and called wide ""It's pleasing one of our top three batted really deep throughout the two series, and we can only kick on from here."" Australia won by 10 wickets (with 49 balls remaining) Player of the match is Sean Abbott, AUS","Australia 0 for 109 (Finch 52*, Warner 48*) beat Pakistan 8 for 106 (Iftikhar 45, Richardson 3-18, Abbott 2-14, Starc 2-29) by 10 wickets At the home of the Perth Scorchers, Australia disposed of Pakistan with a brutal efficiency reminiscent of the West Australian Big Bash League club as coached by Justin Langer, completing a run of five wins in six T20Is that was only interrupted by inconvenient Sydney rain and posed ominous signs for the opposition ahead of next year's World Cup. In front of a crowd of 22,626, a gleeful Aaron Finch sent the tourists in to bat on a lively Perth Stadium pitch, and Pakistan never recovered from the loss of three wickets inside their Powerplay. Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, the recalled Sean Abbott, Billy Stanlake and Ashton Agar covered for the rested Pat Cummins with ease, sharing wickets and responsibility for strangling the batting in an innings that featured no fewer than 26 plays and misses. Additionally, the Australians fielded and caught with rare polish, ensuring that very few Pakistani mistakes went unpunished. A final tally of 106 was about all that can be expected of Pakistan on days when Babar Azam does not bail them out with a score, as they have fallen into a deep T20I hole that had also seen them whitewashed at home by Sri Lanka prior to this one."
"6.40pm Pakistan won the toss and bat (after a little bit of confusion) and have named an unchanged XI Cummins to Zaman, OUT finds mid-off! So another failure for Zaman as he tries to get going. Stayed leg-side of a full delivery, sliced across the delivery, sends a pretty straightforward catch to Warner Kane Richardson to Haris Sohail, OUT he's done it again! Another ugly swipe sees the downfall of Sohail. Back of a length, he swings to the leg side, takes a big top edge and Richardson settles under the simple catch Agar to Rizwan, OUT done all ends up! He started to move outside leg very early, Agar fired it in towards leg stump, it spears between bat and pad. Simple stumping for Carey Agar to Asif Ali, OUT slog sweep straight down long on's throat! Easy catch for Cummins. Babar will be furious. He should have been on strike. It was darted in outside off, he was down on one knee and slog sweeps trying to find the rope, he miscued hitting it straight to long on. Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, SIX runs thumped over square leg into the crowd! Bang! Short slower ball and he picked it, it was in the hitting zone and he smoked it over deep square Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, SIX runs smacked over long off! What a shot! Full outside off, he's hanging back and hammering it through the line, clearing the man on the rope! Kane Richardson to Iftikhar, SIX runs crunch over wide long on! McDermott on the rope parries it over! Length ball in the slot, he clears the front leg and smears it high over long on to the long boundary, McDermott jumps up but can't reel it in Wahab Riaz to Smith, (no ball) fuller, at the stumps, tucked to the midwicket and, oh dear, it's a no-ball. Looked a very tight call Wahab Riaz to Smith, 1 wide sends down a very short slower-ball bouncer, Smith let's it go and gets the wide...the free hit carries over Imad Wasim to McDermott, OUT LBW! Misses sweeping. He reviews after consulting Smith. He was out LBW in Melbourne against Sri Lanka and didn't review when it was missing leg. Nothing on hot spot. Nothing on RTS. No bat involved. There is no ball tracking available for that ball! The decision remains out. The only query was whether it hit in line. Australia win by seven wickets with nine balls to spare. That was a clinic from Steve Smith. That's why he's in this team. Nervy chases when they lose early wickets are his bread and butter. He took control and picked Pakistan apart. He didn't get much help but he didn't need it. Pakistan lost this with the bat in reality as 150 was nowhere near enough. That's it from Canberra. Smith too good and Australia go 1-0 up. Both sides head to Perth for the final match of the series on Friday at Perth Stadium. On behalf of our team, hope you can join us then. Australia won by 7 wickets (with 9 balls remaining) Player of the match is Steven Smith, AUS","Australia 3 for 151 (Smith 80*) beat Pakistan 6 for 150 (Ahmed 52*, Azam 50) by seven wickets It didn't take long for Steven Smith to clamp down on any whispers he might be surplus to the requirements of the Australian T20I side. A commanding half-century that combined pugnacity and poise in exactly the right doses steered Australia to what ended up being a stroll of a chase against Pakistan with victory by seven wickets. It needn't have been as easy as that, though, and didn't look nearly as comfortable when they lost David Warner and Aaron Finch inside the powerplay, more than a hundred runs still to get without the comfort blanket of an explosive Glenn Maxwell in the middle order. It was an innings every bit as modern as T20 cricket requires of its players, but the 51-ball 80 Smith struck contained shots that wouldn't have been out of place at this year's Ashes. Eleven fours and a six, exactly a half-century of them, came in boundaries, and by the final two overs, Smith was properly peaking."
"Starc to Dickwella, OUT gone first ball! Gets a big leading edge into the off side, loops high towards point for a simple catch. Tried to close the face, was early on the stroke but it looked a poor option in the first place as the ball was full outside off Kane Richardson to Mendis, OUT picks out the man at deep square! Couldn't have found him any better. A short ball from Richardson, Mendis strikes it nicely but straight down McDermott's throat. Mendis is furious. Richardson has his first wicket of the series Cummins to Fernando, OUT chipped straight to deep backward square! Short of a length and cramping him up at the hips again. He stays on the front foot and looks to use the angle and pace to launch this behind square. But that's taken well inside Agar to Perera, 1 leg bye appeal for lbw as he's caught on the front leg trying to sweep. Agar is around the wicket, that probably pitched outside leg Cummins to Perera, OUT taken at extra cover. Finally manages to find that fielder after many close shaves. Short of a length at off. Backs into the leg side and pulls. Slices it right up for the fielder, he barely has to move Starc to Jayasuriya, OUT loses leg stump. Full ball headed into leg stump, the same kind that was lifted for a six earlier. Jayasuriya though has looked for a reverse ramp, while standing on his feet. No way he's going to pull that off from there Kane Richardson to Malinga, SIX runs smokes it over long-on! Wow! Richardson looks for the slower ball but drops it short. It sits nicely up at off stump and Malinga just lines up beside it and flat-bats it Kane Richardson to Rajapaksa, 1 leg bye slower short ball into the body. Looks for the slog but cops that on the body 8:43pm Sri Lanka finally get to a serviceable score. They lost their openers in the Powerplay and hopes of an acceleration seemed as dim as the last two games. But that partnership for the third wicket allowed some stability, and Kusal Perera got going towards the end of his fifty. A flourish from Rajapaksa and Malinga too at the end. But Pradeep to Warner, 1 leg bye tight single as this bobbles out to the off side...111kph slower ball to start with, takes the pad Pradeep to Finch, 1 leg bye another huge appeal for lbw, this time it's Finch missing a swinging yorker but it's sliding down the leg side Pradeep to Warner, 1 wide short down the leg side, swing and a miss Jayasuriya to Finch, SIX runs round the wicket, stand and deliver from Finch as he hoicks this over wide midwicket Lahiru Kumara to Finch, SIX runs what a stroke! That's a cracker from Finch. A full ball on off stump, it's a perfect lofted off-drive through the line over the rope Pradeep to Warner, 1 wide bouncer dug in too short. Let's that go over middle stump Malinga to McDermott, OUT looks plumb. And given. It did strike him in front of leg though, so they'll have a chat about it...and decided not to review. Full and sliding in at leg stump as he looks to drive. Rapped on the front leg with middle and off visible. Perhaps not plumb like it appeared at first, but just clipping leg stump Jayasuriya to Turner, SIX runs pumps it over deep midwicket! Length ball pushed in fast at middle stump. It's sliding on nicely and he slogs through the line to clear the ropes Malinga to Warner, 1 wide bouncer at a middle stump line. Let's that go 10:48pm And that is all from us. Thanks for joining. Australia won by 7 wickets (with 14 balls remaining) Player of the match is David Warner, AUS","Australia 3 for 145 (Warner 57*) beat Sri Lanka 6 for 142 (Perera 57) by seven wickets Sri Lanka were better, the crowd was bigger, but the result was the same. Australia's experienced campaigners led by David Warner, Aaron Finch and Pat Cummins, were once again clinical in their home comforts to whitewash Sri Lanka 3-0. They held Sri Lanka to a sub-par total of 6 for 142 before mowing it down with seven wickets and 14 balls to spare. The difference was Australia's power-hitting, placement and brilliant running in the post powerplay phase on the big expanses of the MCG. David Warner capped a prolific series Getty Images Sri Lanka failed to score a boundary for 39 balls after the powerplay in their innings."
"Tye to Roy, OUT battered high in the air, and Hazlewood circles at mid-on to gather a steepling miscue! The knuckleball does the trick, Roy was deceived by the change of pace, was through his shot too soon, and an aggressive if at times streaky innings comes to an end Marsh to Hales, OUT short ball, Hales tries to wallop it over square leg... but skews a top edge to point! Think that deflected off the helmet, Australia have used his head and Marsh breaks the stand. There's pace in this deck, seemed to surprise Hales and he top-edged it straight into the badge Marsh to Buttler, 1 leg bye Buttler tries to come down, another short ball and it ricochets off his shoulder behind square on the off side Tye to Root, 1 wide off line Tye to Buttler, SIX runs in the slot, and slotted over long-on! Power and placement Tye to Buttler, OUT full, and Buttler holes out to mid-off! That's a critical breakthrough for Australia, Warner back-pedals to complete the catch, and once again, Tye's slower ball draws out the miscue from a well-set batsman Tye to Root, 1 wide short, aggressive, but rather harshly judged as a wide, Zampa to Ali, OUT that's a very soft dismissal from Moeen! Down the track, losing his shape, a wellied drive in the air to cover, and England's hopes of their habitual 300-plus total are looking bleak all of a sudden Tye to Willey, OUT a mow over the leg side, and another catch in the deep! And was that another Tye slower ball? Certainly looked as though Willey was through his shot early, flapping the ball much squarer than he might have intended. This is a fine collective bowling effort from Australia, and England just can't get any momentum back into their innings Tye to Tom Curran, 1 wide less exceptional this time, mind you... Tye to Root, OUT smashed high and hard, but not high enough! In the slot once again, Root got underneath his shot, much like Roy before him, and picks out the man right back on the fence Tye to Ball, OUT well bowled! And that is five for Tye! Yorker, straight and true, rattles the timbers, and England's innings has come to an ignominious end Tom Curran to Head, 4 leg byes strays on to the pads, Warner flicks at it and the ball diverts wide of Buttler, no bat involved Ball to Stoinis, OUT knocked into the covers, called through for a tight single, there's a direct hit and this could be tight... although they then try to pinch a second on the ricochet. It goes up to the third umpire and Head is struggling here, there's only a frame or two in it, but he's not managed to get his bat over the line - this is going to be out! Morgan was the fielder, he pretty much hit the bails wi Ball to Stoinis, 1 wide banged in short, gets up sharply, but there's no reaching that one Ali to Maxwell, SIX runs plants the front foot, and that's up, up and away! Tossed up, tempting the aggression, but expertly executed Rashid to Stoinis, SIX runs up and over... and over the head of long-off! It teased the man on the rope, but just kept on going! Tom Curran to Maxwell, 1 wide 130kph, sliding down the leg side first up Tom Curran to Maxwell, OUT rapped on the pads, nibbling in sharply... Buttler is appealing desperately for lbw and England decide to review Tom Curran to Starc, OUT angled across, nips late and takes the edge - Buttler swallows it going low to his left! Curran leaps to punch the air, brilliant bit of bowling and a catch to match! He was trying to tuck to leg when he needed to play straight, Starc heads off with Daddles for company and Australia are seven down, the chase getting trickier and trickier ""Will we get the inflatable four fingers up for this ending?"" wonders Simon. I suspect England might get a hand gesture or two... Player of the match is Tom Curran, ENG","England 259 (Root 62, Tye 5-46) beat Australia 247 (Stoinis 87, Curran 5-35) by 12 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details A shattering spell of reverse swing by Tom Curran foiled Australia's chase of a modest England total and in turn silenced a West Australian record crowd of 53,781 in the first ODI to be played at Perth's new stadium. A trio of players from out west - Mitchell Marsh, AJ Tye and Marcus Stoinis - had prospered earlier in the match, but it was the effervescent Curran who had the final say, years after he had been childhood friends with Marsh when growing up in Zimbabwe. Australia seemed to be travelling comfortably in pursuit of 260 for victory, after England's batsmen had squandered a series of starts, when Stoinis fell within sight of a hundred upon his promotion to No. 3 in the home side's batting order. Having earlier ended a poor series for David Warner with a lively yorker, Curran was called back by Eoin Morgan and had his second ball curling back to confound the recalled Glenn Maxwell."
"1.20pm: We've have a toss! And Australia have won it and will bowl, they are going to try and chase again. Travis Head returns to the top of the order, in Finch's absence, while Mitchell Starc is rested and Andrew Tye gets another crack. Just one change for England, with Tom Curran replacing the injured Liam Plunkett. Cummins to Hales, OUT bowled 'im! Superb ball from Cummins and England are two down for spit! There's been some nip off this fresh surface and Cummins locates the perfect length, it jags back appreciably as Hales presses forwards, flicks the front pad before rattling the off pole Cummins to Root, OUT dug in, Root wafts at a pull, gets a big, ballooning top edge... and Hazlewood pockets the catch at fine leg! Root bags a duck and England are four down! Good pace and bounce, the bumper got too big for Root and he sent it right down the fielder's gullet. This could get ugly Hazlewood to Buttler, OUT zips off a length, grazes the outside edge! ENGLAND ARE 8 FOR 5!!! (Or 5 for 8, if you're that sort...) Brilliant ball from Hazlewood, not too much fault with the batsman here: perfect length, seaming a fraction as Buttler felt for it in defence, flicks the bat and Paine swallows another! Cummins to Morgan, OUT short, down the leg side and Morgan has gloved through to the keeper! That would have been a wide had he let it go, but the pace drew him into a response, and a thin tickle does the rest! England's revival is dented by a familiar foe Tye to Ali, OUT panned out to deep midwicket and picks out the fielder! A sharp double take as Head senses the rope behind him, tosses the ball back into play, and gathers at the second attempt Cummins to Rashid, OUT back of a length, a simple nibble outside off, and Cummins strikes again! Tye to Tom Curran, 1 bye woof, that's gone through, 138kph and it cuts through Curran, misses the edge by a whisker and then defeats Paine, deflecting off the gloves for a bye Stoinis to Woakes, SIX runs short-arm jabbed into the stands! That is some strike from Woakes, who is in Ribena form right now... not a terrible ball from Stoinis, slightly short but just helped over the rope at deep midwicket 5.10pm: So, England bowled out early, which was pretty much what was expected when they were 8 for 5 (EIGHT for FIVE) in the seventh over. But not quite as early as you might have imagined, with their big-bottomed lower order helping them to within a sniff of 200. Chris Woakes continued his fine series with the bat by pulling and 8.53pm So, that is the end of that. So, the series moves to Perth for the finale ... and the start of a new era with the WACA put to mothballs and 60,000 people anticipated in the city's new purpose-built stadium. Join us there on Sunday for all the fun of the fair. Australia won by 3 wickets (with 78 balls remaining) Player of the match is Pat Cummins, AUS","Australia 197 for 7 (Head 96, Rashid 3-49) beat England 196 (Woakes 78, Cummins 4-24, Tye 3-33, Hazlewood 3-39) by three wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details For a match that appeared over inside 10 overs, Australia's first ODI victory since September did not come easy. The new-ball pair of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood filleted England's top order, but Chris Woakes' doughty rearguard and Adil Rashid's variations allowed the Australia Day ODI to creep into floodlit hours while Travis Head guided his team close to home. A slimmer-than-expected Adelaide Oval crowd of 24,329 seemed destined to be filing out of the exits early when Cummins and Hazlewood combined to have Eoin Morgan's side a sickly 5 for 8 as the new ball swung and seamed, before Woakes delivered his latest outstanding display of a series England had already won. Woakes' innings ensured that Australia needed at least one score of note to register their first ODI win since last year's India tour and only their second since January 2017, and it was Head, returning to the top of the order in the absence of the injured Aaron Finch, who provided it. His calm presence, laced with regular boundaries, contrasted with less certain innings from David Warner, Cameron White and the captain Steven Smith."
"Zampa to Bairstow, OUT oh beautifully bowled. The previous one was the legbreak, this one was the googly. They both were really full, the length allowed Bairstow to throw his hands at the line without his feet. What that did was create a big gap between bat and pad, the legbreak found the middle of the bat, the googly found a massive gap between bat and Hazlewood to Root, OUT 135 kph, the first today but may not be the last. Root chops on. Was just saying Root is so good at finding gaps, and his natural instinct of trying to do so kicks in. It's a good length delivery outside off that seams back in, with Hazlewood's natural angle. The safer shot would have been playing with a full face, but Root tries Hazlewood to Morgan, OUT gottim! Morgan tries to open the face but ends up gliding an edge to the keeper! Hazlewood makes the breakthrough, just as England were starting to look fluent again. Used the angle across Morgan, who played pretty well but is still searching for a major contribution Marsh to Buttler, 1 wide pushes down the leg side as Buttler moves across Marsh to Ali, OUT bowled him, Moeen drags on! He'll have to drag himself off, it's not been a fun tour with the bat for him... Back of a length, this time the ugly swipe goes down, rather than up, and raps the top of off stump - no chance for a fielder to mess things up and Marsh has a wicket Hazlewood to Woakes, 1 leg bye length ball, 138kph but drifting leg side, deflected off the pads for one more Hazlewood to Buttler, SIX runs maximum pain exacted moments later, Buttler creaming a flat six over long-off! The beast raises an eyebrow and bares its teeth Cummins to Woakes, SIX runs short ball, slugged over the ropes at deep square leg! Woakes connects with a meaty pull and it sails for six, bringing up the England 250 in the process Cummins to Buttler, SIX runs smoked into the boundary boards, a fierce, flat pull and it goes all the way! Cummins to Buttler, SIX runs clubbed straight down the ground for six more! Humpty from Buttler, he dumps a full ball into the crowd - and he's into the 90s! Wood to White, OUT edged and gone! A start for White but he perishes looking to force the ball through point. May have been done in by some extra bounce. Back of a length delivery outside off, White looks to hit the ball through point but all he can get is a thin outside edge. Was actually looking quite solid on a tricky surface Rashid to Finch, OUT tosses up the legbreak, Finch goes to sweep, hit on the pads - and given! Finch immediately signals for a review, seeming to suggest he got some bat on it... but there's no bottom edge on the replays, and Hawk-Eye has it clipping leg stump! It was very close to sliding by but umpire's call is all England needed. Huge wicket, no hund Wood to Smith, OUT throws the hands, thick edge and Buttler snaffles a terrific low grab! Wood is delirious as he charges off...but Smith isn't walking. This is going to the TV umpire, and the soft signal is out, which could be crucial. Has he got fingertips under it? This is going to be incredibly tight, it's a fantastic effort from Buttler, but is the Rashid to Stoinis, SIX runs that's a confident shot. And runs give you confidence. Runs down to a good wristspinner early in his innings, backs his ability, gets to the pitch and drills a drive over mid-on. All the way Rashid to Marsh, OUT taken at long-on. And Australia stumble further. This is a huge moment, the set man has picked out long-on. There have been so many dismissals where a batsman mistakes a flat legspinner for a long-hop. Happened to Guptill against Zampa at this ground, think it was last year. Marsh goes back and looks to pull over midwicket, but the Rashid to Stoinis, 1 bye bye? Flight outside off, Stoinis misses a drive, the ball deflects off Buttler's gloves for one to third man 10.08pm This England ODI juggernaut continues to roll. They have got to be one of the best in the world currently. They have beaten a strong Australia team thrice in succession away from home. And three convincing wins. The series is done. The Tests and the ODIs one-sided, but dominated by different teams. Player of the match is Jos Buttler, ENG","England 6 for 302 (Buttler 100*, Woakes 53*) beat Australia 6 for 286 (Finch 62, Stoinis 56, Marsh 55) by 16 runs Scorecard and ball-by-ball details Jos Buttler's stunning century and a composed all-round effort with the ball helped England clinch the ODI series with two matches to play. Although Marcus Stoinis kept Australia in the hunt until the final over, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes closed the game out with another smart display of death bowling. England had been struggling on 6 for 189 when Buttler and Woakes came together but they put on an unbroken 113-run stand to take the total beyond 300. Buttler reached his fifth one-day hundred from the last ball of the innings as England made far more than had looked likely. He then took a contentious catch to dismiss Steven Smith at a key point in the chase as England held on to go 3-0 up."
"Plunkett to Warner, 1 wide down the leg side, Warner misses his flick but he'll get that ball again Ali to Warner, OUT edged, taken! Lovely stuff from Moeen. This is tighter to off stump, Warner looking to push into the off side, takes an outside edge and snaffled at slip Rashid to Finch, SIX runs that's high and handsome! A full delivery, Finch stays in the crease, and lofts it cleanly straight down the ground over long-on Plunkett to Smith, 1 wide attacking the tramlines on a full length outside off, but just a tick too far outside off for the umpire's liking Root to Smith, OUT huge appeal and Smith is pinned lbw! Unsurprisingly, he has reviewed... he was stretching onto the front foot, might it have hit him outside the line? Nope, that is trimming the top of the leg bail and what a breakthrough! Woakes to Marsh, 1 wide short, too short. Good aggression but there was no reaching that one Woakes to Finch, 1 leg bye short of a length, angled into the pad, deflects off the thigh guard behind square Plunkett to Finch, 1 wide slips this down the leg side, an angry cry from Plunkett Rashid to Marsh, OUT he's gone now! He knew he had to press the accelerator, he charges out of his crease, nowhere near the ball, has a swing across the line, misses and it's a simple stumping for Buttler Plunkett to Finch, OUT finds mid-on! Once again, England strike back-to-back...went to drive down the ground, think he wanted to go over top, got no sort of elevation and it's a simple catch on the edge of the circle Rashid to Stoinis, OUT given caught behind! That's a lovely piece of bowling, England on the charge. Floated up on off stump, draws Stonis forward, spins away as he drives and it's a thin snick Woakes to Starc, OUT this time he's taken at deep midwicket! Roy this time. Good length, bit of pace off, Starc tries to clear the leg side and can't get the distance needed Well, what do we make of that from Australia? Apart from Aaron Finch, it felt pretty ordinary. However, all credit to England. They bowled very impressively, spin playing a key role with Root chipping in with two wickets, and Eoin Morgan's captaincy and tactics were outstanding. England didn't have any problem chasing over 300 a few days ago so they'll be hugely confident Tye to Hales, 1 wide short and aggressive. Too short... Starc to Buttler, 1 wide down the leg side ""Richo bowled pretty well, perhaps [we should have played a spinner]. This wicket is different to the one we had for the Test match."" 9.02pm Right, that's your lot. Thanks for joining us today, have a read of Dan Brettig's report and join us again on Sunday for the third ODI in Sydney, where Australia desperately need a win to stay alive in the series. England won by 4 wickets (with 34 balls remaining) Player of the match is Joe Root, ENG","England 6 for 274 (Bairstow 60, Hales 57, Starc 4-57) beat Australia 9 for 270 (Finch 106) by 4 wickets Scorecard and ball-by-ball details ""It was surrounded by Jason's incredible innings, but I've no doubt somebody else would've put their hand up if needed."" With these words Eoin Morgan summed up England's confidence after an opening win in Melbourne. Five days later at the Gabba it proved a prescient assessment, as the visitors did without a Jason Roy special to again run rings around a desperately muddled Australia. Clearly, Australia's decision-makers had judged themselves to have not made enough runs in Melbourne - Adam Zampa was out and Cameron White in. As if to take the mickey out of that choice, England employed three spinners to bog down the hosts after Steven Smith won the toss, before taking a horrid toll on Travis Head when he was employed as the quasi-specialist Australian slow bowler."
